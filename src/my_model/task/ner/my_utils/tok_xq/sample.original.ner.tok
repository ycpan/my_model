" WASHINGTON — Congressional Republicans have a new fear when it comes to their health care lawsuit against the Obama administration : They might win . The incoming Trump administration could choose to no longer defend the executive branch against the suit which challenges the administration ’s authority to spend billions of dollars on health insurance subsidies for and Americans handing House Republicans a big victory on issues . But a sudden loss of the disputed subsidies could conceivably cause the health care program to implode leaving millions of people without access to health insurance before Republicans have prepared a replacement . That could lead to chaos in the insurance market and spur a political backlash just as Republicans gain full control of the government . To stave off that outcome Republicans could find themselves in the awkward position of appropriating huge sums to temporarily prop up the Obama health care law angering conservative voters who have been demanding an end to the law for years . In another twist Donald J. Trump ’s administration worried about preserving executive branch prerogatives could choose to fight its Republican allies in the House on some central questions in the dispute . Eager to avoid an ugly political pileup Republicans on Capitol Hill and the Trump transition team are gaming out how to handle the lawsuit which after the election has been put in limbo until at least late February by the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit . They are not yet ready to divulge their strategy . “ Given that this pending litigation involves the Obama administration and Congress it would be inappropriate to comment ” said Phillip J. Blando a spokesman for the Trump transition effort . “ Upon taking office the Trump administration will evaluate this case and all related aspects of the Affordable Care Act . ” In a potentially decision in 2015 Judge Rosemary M. Collyer ruled that House Republicans had the standing to sue the executive branch over a spending dispute and that the Obama administration had been distributing the health insurance subsidies in violation of the Constitution without approval from Congress . The Justice Department confident that Judge Collyer ’s decision would be reversed
" After the bullet shells get counted the blood dries and the votive candles burn out people peer down from windows and see crime scenes gone cold : a band of yellow police tape blowing in the breeze . The South Bronx just across the Harlem River from Manhattan and once shorthand for urban dysfunction still suffers violence at levels long ago slashed in many other parts of New York City . And yet the city ’s efforts to fight it remain splintered underfunded and burdened by scandal . In the 40th Precinct at the southern tip of the Bronx as in other poor minority neighborhoods across the country people long hounded for infractions are crying out for more protection against grievous injury or death . By September four of every five shootings in the precinct this year were unsolved . Out of the city ’s 77 precincts the 40th has the highest murder rate but the fewest detectives per violent crime reflecting disparities in staffing that hit hardest in some neighborhoods outside Manhattan according to a New York Times analysis of Police Department data . Investigators in the precinct are saddled with twice the number of cases the department recommends even as their bosses are called to Police Headquarters to answer for the sharpest crime rise in the city this year . And across the Bronx investigative resources are squeezed . It has the highest rate of the city ’s five boroughs but the thinnest detective staffing . Nine of the 14 precinct detective squads for violent crime in the city are there . The borough ’s robbery squad is smaller than Manhattan ’s even though the Bronx has had 1300 more cases this year . And its homicide squad has one detective for every four murders compared with one detective for roughly every two murders in Upper Manhattan and more than one detective per murder in Lower Manhattan . In lobbies and family apartments outside methadone clinics and art studios people take note of the inequity . They hear police commanders explain that they lack the resources to place a floodlight on a dangerous block or to post officers at a corner . They watch witnesses cower behind doors
1.0"When Walt Disney ’s “ Bambi ” opened in 1942 critics praised its spare haunting visual style vastly different from anything Disney had done before . But what they did not know was that the film ’s striking appearance had been created by a Chinese immigrant artist who took as his inspiration the landscape paintings of the Song dynasty . The extent of his contribution to “ Bambi ” which remains a mark for film animation would not be widely known for decades . Like the film ’s title character the artist Tyrus Wong weathered irrevocable separation from his mother — and in the hope of making a life in America incarceration isolation and rigorous interrogation — all when he was still a child . In the years that followed he endured poverty discrimination and chronic lack of recognition not only for his work at Disney but also for his fine art before finding acclaim in his 90 s . Mr. Wong died on Friday at 106 . A Hollywood studio artist painter printmaker
" Death may be the great equalizer but it isn ’t necessarily evenhanded . Of all the fields of endeavor that suffered mortal losses in 2016 — consider Muhammad Ali and Arnold Palmer in sports and the Hollywood deaths of Carrie Fisher and Debbie Reynolds — the pop music world had hands down the bleakest year . Start with David Bowie whose stage persona — androgynous glam rocker dance pop star electronic experimentalist — was as as his music . The year was only days old when the news came that he had died of cancer at 69 . He had hinted that his time was short in the lyrics of his final album released just two days before his death but he had otherwise gone to great lengths to hide his illness from the public a wish for privacy that ensured that his death would appear to have come out of the blue . Then came another shock about three months later when Prince accidentally overdosed on a painkiller and collapsed in an elevator at his sprawling home studio near Minneapolis . Death came to him at 57 and by all indications no one including Prince Rogers Nelson had seen it coming . As energetic onstage as ever holding to an otherwise healthy regimen he had successfully defied age into his sixth decade so why not death too ? Leonard Cohen on the other hand
" SEOUL South Korea — North Korea ’s leader Kim said on Sunday that his country was making final preparations to conduct its first test of an intercontinental ballistic missile — a bold statement less than a month before the inauguration of Donald J. Trump . Although North Korea has conducted five nuclear tests in the last decade and more than 20 ballistic missile tests in 2016 alone and although it habitually threatens to attack the United States with nuclear weapons the country has never an intercontinental ballistic missile or ICBM . In his annual New Year ’s Day speech which was broadcast on the North ’s KCTV on Sunday Mr. Kim spoke proudly of the strides he said his country had made in its nuclear weapons and ballistic missile programs . He said North Korea would continue to bolster its weapons programs as long as the United States remained hostile and continued its joint military exercises with South Korea . “ We have reached the final stage in preparations to an intercontinental ballistic rocket ” he said . Analysts in the region have said Mr. Kim might conduct another weapons test in coming months taking advantage of leadership changes in the United States and South Korea . Mr. Trump will be sworn in on Jan. 20 . In South Korea President Park whose powers were suspended in a Parliamentary impeachment on Dec. 9 is waiting for the Constitutional Court to rule on whether she should be formally removed from office or reinstated . If North Korea conducts a test in coming months it will test Mr. Trump ’s new administration despite years of increasingly harsh sanctions North Korea has been advancing toward Mr. Kim ’s professed goal of arming his isolated country with the ability to deliver a nuclear warhead to the United States . Mr. Kim ’s speech on Sunday indicated that North Korea may a rocket several times this year to complete its ICBM program said Cheong a senior research fellow at the Sejong Institute in South Korea . The first of such tests could come even before Mr. Trump ’s inauguration Mr. Cheong said . “ We need to take note of the fact that this is the first New Year ’s speech where Kim mentioned an intercontinental ballistic missile ” he said . In his speech Mr. Kim did not comment on Mr. Trump ’s election . Doubt still runs deep that North Korea has mastered all the technology needed to build a reliable ICBM . But analysts in the region said the North ’s launchings of rockets to put satellites into orbit in recent years showed that the country had cleared some key technological hurdles . After the North ’s satellite launch in February South Korean defense officials said the Unha rocket used in the launch if successfully reconfigured as a missile could fly more than 7
" LONDON — Queen Elizabeth II who has been battling a cold for more than a week missed a New Year ’s Day church service at her country estate in Sandringham Buckingham Palace said on Sunday . A week earlier the queen who is 90 missed a Christmas Day church service for the first time since 1988 because of the illness . “ The Queen does not yet feel ready to attend church as she is still recuperating from a heavy cold ” the palace said in a statement . The queen ’s husband Prince Philip who had also been ill was well enough to attend both services in the church at Sandringham which is in Norfolk on the east coast of England . The queen who ascended to the throne in 1952 became the world ’s monarch following the death of King Bhumibol Adulyadej of Thailand in October . She is also Britain ’s monarch having last year surpassed Queen Victoria ’s reign . Her mother lived until the age of 101 . "
" BEIJING — President Tsai of Taiwan sharply criticized China ’s leaders on Saturday saying they had resorted to military and economic threats in order to intimidate the island . “ Step by step Beijing is going back to the old path of dividing coercing and even threatening and intimidating Taiwan ” she told journalists in Taipei the capital at a news conference . Tensions between Taiwan and China which have been rivals since the Communist Revolution of 1949 intensified in December after Ms. Tsai spoke on the phone with the American Donald J. Trump breaking a longstanding diplomatic practice . In recent weeks China has stepped up military activities near Taiwan sending its sole aircraft carrier through the waters near the island and dispatching military planes in the region . On Monday Beijing announced that São Tomé and Príncipe an island nation off the west coast of Africa that was one of Taiwan ’s fewer than two dozen remaining diplomatic allies had switched its allegiance to the mainland provoking an outcry in Taiwan . Despite Beijing ’s recent actions which she said had “ hurt the feelings ” of the Taiwanese people and destabilized relations Ms. Tsai vowed to avoid a confrontation . “ We will not bow to pressure and we will of course not revert to the old path of confrontation ” she said . Ms. Tsai faces the delicate task of registering discontent with Beijing while also sending a message that Taiwan will exercise restraint . The United States which sees Taiwan as one of its most reliable allies in Asia and has sold billions of dollars of weapons to the island

" Just how is Hillary Kerr the founder of a digital media company in Los Angeles ? She can tell you what song was playing five years ago on the jukebox at the bar where she somewhat randomly met the man who became her husband . It was “ These Days ” the version sung by Nico the German made famous by Andy Warhol and the Velvet Underground . Actually the song had been playing just before she met Jonathan Leahy now 38 on that December night in 2011 at the 4100 Bar in the Silver Lake district of Los Angeles . Ms. Kerr can ’t remember exactly what was playing when they met because at that moment she was jumping up and down “ like Tigger ” as she put it . In answering the usual questions Mr. Leahy told her he was a music supervisor for “ Girls ” the HBO show created by and starring Lena Dunham . That was enough to get Ms. Kerr bouncing . “ Your music has changed my life ! ” she told Mr. Leahy . Mr. Leahy who is quiet but not shy ( at least he doesn ’t jump up and down upon meeting people ) was mesmerized . “ My main reaction ” he said “ was it ’s a lot easier to talk to beautiful women in a bar when you ’re working on a hit show . ” They exchanged email addresses more an act of politeness than promise . Then their soundtrack went quiet for almost a year . Both Mr. Leahy and Ms. Kerr had active social lives but they were focused on their careers . Mr. Leahy who grew up in Laconia N. H. graduated from the College of William and Mary in Williamsburg Va . in 2000 and landed in Los Angeles later that year . Now he is a music supervisor with Aperture Music and is joined by Manish Raval and Tom Wolfe in being responsible for the music on “ Girls . ” The team has also worked on films including “ Trainwreck ” and television series such as “ New Girl . ” In addition Mr. Leahy is the music supervisor for “ Survivor ’s Remorse ” on Starz . Ms. Kerr grew up in the La Jolla section of San Diego graduated from the University of Southern California in 2000 and eventually made her way to New York
" Angels are everywhere in the Muñiz family ’s apartment in the Bronx : paintings of angels on the wall ceramic angels flanking the ancient VCR angels strumming lyres or blowing little golden trumpets on the bathroom shelves . As José and Zoraida Muñiz and their children have struggled to deal with a series of trials and setbacks including cancer debilitating epilepsy deep depression and near eviction it has sometimes seemed as if angels and love were the only forces holding things together . Zoraida ’s early life in Puerto Rico was like something from a tropical Dickens novel . She and her siblings and mother built a house by hand after a hurricane ravaged their home and the children ’s father withdrew support . Then Zoraida ’s grandfather — the father of her absent father — destroyed the house in a rage . She was barely a teenager when she met José a Vietnam War veteran . With permission from her uncle a judge they were married . She was 14 . He was 29 . They moved to New York in 1983 and started a new life . He built boilers . She worked in construction using skills she learned as a child and in a clothing store . But in 1987 Mr. Muñiz began having violent seizures — eight or 10 a day . They did not respond to medication . He could no longer work . She stopped working to take care of him . Still determined to live something like a normal life they started a family . Their first child José Jr . had a heart defect . By the time he was 2 he had had six operations . That ’s where the angels came in — the first one was a painting a gift from a cousin . “ When they operated on my son they told me he was an angel because he was supposed to die ” Ms. Muñiz 50 said . “ From there I figured that angels are taking care of me and protecting me and my family . ” All the angels are gifts from friends and relatives
" With Donald J. Trump about to take control of the White House it would seem a dark time for the renewable energy industry . After all Mr. Trump has mocked the science of global warming as a Chinese hoax threatened to kill a global deal on climate change and promised to restore the coal industry to its former glory . So consider what happened in the middle of December after investors had had a month to absorb the implications of Mr. Trump ’s victory . The federal government opened bidding on a tract of the ocean floor off New York State as a potential site for a huge wind farm . Up up and away soared the offers — interest from the bidders was so fevered that the auction went through 33 rounds and spilled over to a second day . In the end the winning bidder offered the federal Treasury $ 42 million more than twice what the government got in August for oil leases — oil leases — in the Gulf of Mexico . Who won the bid ? None other than Statoil the Norwegian oil company which is in the midst of a major campaign to turn itself into a big player in renewable energy . We do not know for sure that the New York wind farm will get built but we do know this : The energy transition is real and Mr. Trump is not going to stop it . On a global scale more than half the investment in new electricity generation is going into renewable energy . That is more than $ 300 billion a year a sign of how powerful the momentum has become . Wind power is booming in the United States with the industry adding manufacturing jobs in the reddest states . When Mr. Trump ’s appointees examine the facts they will learn that technician is projected to be the occupation in America over the next decade . The election of Mr. Trump left climate activists and environmental groups in despair . They had pinned their hopes on a Hillary Clinton victory and a continuation of President Obama ’s strong push to tackle global warming . Now of course everything is in flux . In the worst case with a sufficiently pliant Congress Mr. Trump could roll back a decade of progress on climate change . Barring some miraculous conversion on Mr. Trump ’s part his election cannot be interpreted as anything but bad news for the climate agenda . Yet despair might be an overreaction . For starters
" THOMPSONS Tex . — Can one of the most promising — and troubled — technologies for fighting global warming survive during the administration of Donald J. Trump ? The technology carbon capture involves pulling carbon dioxide out of smokestacks and industrial processes before the gas can make its way into the atmosphere . Mr. Trump ’s denial of the overwhelming scientific evidence supporting climate change a view shared by many of his cabinet nominees might appear to doom any such environmental initiatives . But the new Petra Nova plant about to start running here about 30 miles southwest of Houston is a bright spot for the technology ’s supporters . It is being completed essentially on time and within its budget unlike many previous such projects . When it fires up the plant which is attached to one of the power company NRG ’s hulking units will draw 90 percent of the CO2 from the emissions produced by 240 megawatts of generated power . That is a fraction of the roughly 3700 megawatts produced at this gargantuan plant the largest in the Lone Star State . Still it is enough to capture 1. 6 million tons of carbon dioxide each year — equivalent to the greenhouse gas produced by driving 3. 5 billion miles or the CO2 from generating electricity for 214338 homes . From a tower hundreds of feet above the Petra Nova operation the carbon capture system looks like a fever dream of an Erector set fanatic with mazes of pipes and gleaming tanks set off from the main plant ’s skyscraping smokestacks and busy coal conveyors . Petra Nova uses the most common technology for carbon capture . The exhaust stream pushed down a snaking conduit to the Petra Nova equipment is exposed to a solution of chemicals known as amines
" WEST PALM BEACH Fla . — When Donald J. Trump rang in the new year this weekend he did it in opulence joined by the actor Sylvester Stallone the gossip page fixture Fabio and a crowd of wealthy developers reveling under the swaying palm trees at Mr. Trump ’s resort in Palm Beach . President George W. Bush had his ranch in Crawford Tex . His father had a compound in Kennebunkport Me . President Obama has taken frequent vacations in Hawaii staying at a private home . But Mr. Trump ’s private club in Florida where he has spent the past two weeks away from his home in New York City is likely to eclipse them all as the 45th president ’s winter White House . And that was always the intention of Marjorie Meriweather Post the cereal heiress and the property ’s original owner who left to the federal government when she died in 1973 hoping it would serve as a home for presidents . But the government had no interest in her plan and Mr. Trump later bought the property for less than $ 10 million turning it into a club where membership costs six figures . Mr. Trump ’s arrival was greeted with sneers by the Palm Beach elite and he opened up ’s membership to Jews and who had been excluded from other establishments . He was also the first club owner on the island to admit an openly gay couple . Since Mr. Trump ’s victory in November has been stuffed with guests attracted by an amenity unique to this club : the chance to rub shoulders with the next president . “ It ’s like going to Disneyland and knowing Mickey Mouse will be there all day long ” said Jeff Greene a developer and unsuccessful Democratic candidate for the Senate from Florida in 2010 who is a member and was a Hillary Clinton supporter . Instead of hosting major corporate executives and potential cabinet secretaries for interviews inside a boxy transition office at Trump Tower in Midtown Manhattan

Most of the choices we make each day may feel like the products of decision making but they ’re not . They ’re habits . And though each habit means relatively little on its own over time the meals we eat how we spend our evenings and how often we exercise have enormous impacts . This is particularly true in our 20 s when so many of our habits are still up for grabs . The patterns you establish right now will impact your health productivity financial security and happiness for decades . How much money you make how much time you spend with your friends and family how well your body functions years from now — all of these in many ways are products of the habits you are building today . ( Related : The 8 health habits experts say you need in your 20 s ) And in the last decade our understanding of the neurology of habit formation has been transformed . We ’ve learned how habits form — and why they are so hard to break . We now know how to create good habits and change bad ones like never before . At the core of every habit is a neurological loop with three parts : A cue a routine and a reward . To understand how to create habits — such as exercise habits — you must learn to establish the right cues and rewards .

" It ’s the season for family travel and photos — and perhaps enlarging some of those images of snowy landscapes or tropical getaways to decorate your home . There are of course the usual print services and methods . You can choose a glossy or matte finish print a photo on canvas or make it into a poster with a few clicks online at photo sites like Snapfish and Shutterfly professional photo shops like Adorama and Mpix or drugstores and chains like Walgreens and Costco . But the web is also home to many printing services as well as uncommon surfaces on which to enlarge photos for display be it burlap wood boards acrylic or fabric . Why not try some fresh sites and methods ? I recently sent some quality iPhone vacation photos to a handful of companies that I ’d never used before and had them enlarged to various sizes and printed on different surfaces . I ’ve also offered some guidance about bulk digitizing those boxes of old travel photos sitting in your closet or basement so that you can begin the New Year if not with a vacation then with a home . Of all the ways to turn photos into wall art I was most interested in trying engineer prints named for the large lightweight prints used by architects . For less than the cost of a couple of movie tickets you can make huge enlargements . Mind you it ’s a particular aesthetic one that ’s most likely to appeal to people who are after an industrial shabby chic or bohemian look . The paper is thin and the lines of the images are softer than a fine art print . And engineer prints need not be formally framed . People stick them to their walls with washi tape a crafting tape that comes in innumerable colors and prints or they hang the prints using wood poster rails or skeleton clips . For a while engineer prints from photos were primarily available in black and white
" Finally . The Second Avenue subway opened in New York City on Sunday with thousands of riders flooding into its polished stations to witness a piece of history nearly a century in the making . They descended beneath the streets of the Upper East Side of Manhattan to board Q trains bound for Coney Island in Brooklyn . They cheered . Their eyes filled with tears . They snapped selfies in front of colorful mosaics lining the walls of the stations . It was the first day of 2017 and it felt like a new day for a city that for so long struggled to build this sorely needed subway line . In a rare display of unbridled optimism from hardened New Yorkers they arrived with huge grins and wide eyes taking in the bells and whistles at three new stations . “ I was very choked up ” Betsy Morris 70 said as she rode the first train to leave the 96th Street station at noon . “ How do you explain something that you never thought would happen ? It ’s going to change the way everybody lives as far as commuting goes . ” It was a major moment for New York ’s sprawling transit system after decades of failed efforts to bring the line to one of the few corners of Manhattan the subway did not reach . The opening of the first segment of the line — an extension of the Q train to 96th Street — promises to lighten the crush of passengers on the Nos. 4 5 and 6 trains along Lexington Avenue the nation ’s most overcrowded subway line which had been the only line on the Upper East Side of Manhattan . When the stations opened shortly before noon they were quickly filled with giddy riders both young and old and strollers suitcases and dogs — all familiar sights across the system . But for all the excitement the line with just three new stops is much more modest than the ambitious route running the length of Manhattan that was once envisioned . It serves a relatively affluent and not very diverse part of the city which has more than eight and a half million people and many and minority residents who live far from a subway line . With the subway reaching its highest ridership levels since 1948 much of the aging system is plagued by crowding and delays
" pages into the journal found in Dylann S. Roof ’s car — after the assertions of black inferiority the lamentations over white powerlessness the longing for a race war — comes an incongruous declaration . “ I want state that I am morally opposed to psychology ” wrote the young white supremacist who would murder nine black worshipers at Emanuel A. M. E. Church in Charleston S. C. in June 2015 . “ It is a Jewish invention and does nothing but invent diseases and tell people they have problems when they dont . ” Mr. Roof who plans to represent himself when the penalty phase of his federal capital trial begins on Tuesday apparently is devoted enough to that proposition ( or delusion as some maintain ) to stake his life on it . Although a defense based on his psychological capacity might be his best opportunity to avoid execution he seems steadfastly committed to preventing any public examination of his mental state or background . “ I will not be calling mental health experts or presenting mental health evidence ” he wrote to Judge Richard M. Gergel of Federal District Court on Dec. 16 a day after a jury took only two hours to find him guilty of 33 counts including hate crimes resulting in death obstruction of religion and firearms violations . At a hearing on Wednesday Mr. Roof told the judge that he planned to make an opening statement but not call witnesses or present evidence on his behalf . The testimony presented by prosecutors during the guilt phase of Mr. Roof ’s trial detailed with gruesome precision how he had plotted and executed the massacre during a Wednesday night Bible study in the church ’s fellowship hall . It was less satisfying in revealing why he had done it . With his choice to sideline his legal team and represent himself the second phase — when the same jury of nine whites and three blacks will decide whether to sentence him to death or to life in prison — may prove little different . Death penalty experts said it was exceedingly rare for capital defendants to represent themselves after allowing lawyers to handle the initial part of a case . Mr. Roof who also faces a death penalty trial in state court has not publicly explained his reasoning . But legal filings strongly suggest a split with his defenders about whether to argue that his rampage resulted from mental illness . Mr. Roof ’s lead lawyer David I. Bruck tried repeatedly to plant that notion during the guilt phase knowing it might be his only chance . Because evidence of mitigating factors is supposed to be reserved for the penalty phase
" MUMBAI India — It was a bold and risky gamble by Prime Minister Narendra Modi of India that quickly seemed to backfire . The announcement of a ban on the largest currency bills circulating in India which came into full effect at midnight Friday the last day for depositing the old notes at banks set off cash shortages that have hit the country ’s most vulnerable people hard and prompted worries about the economy . But despite those concerns as well as doubts about whether the currency ban will reduce corruption as it is designed to do for the moment at least Mr. Modi ’s bet appears to be paying off in the public arena . Even as the poorest Indians have struggled many have continued to voice support for the prime minister ’s initiative to target the vast amounts of untaxed money known as “ black money ” flowing through the country ’s economy in hopes that it will combat an endemic culture of corruption . Mr. Modi analysts say has successfully tapped into deep frustration with the corruption that pervades almost every public interface with government . “ Even though the cash ban has produced enormous hardship for me and my family I support what Mr. Modi is doing for our country ” said Hem Raj Chechi 39 a taxi driver in New Delhi the capital
" BAGHDAD — A suicide bomber detonated a pickup truck loaded with explosives on Monday in a busy Baghdad market killing at least 36 people hours after President François Hollande of France arrived in the Iraqi capital . The Islamic State later claimed responsibility for the attack . The bomb went off in a produce market that was packed with day laborers a police officer said adding that another 52 people were wounded . During a news conference with Mr. Hollande Haider Iraq ’s prime minister said the suicide bomber had pretended to be a man seeking to hire day laborers . Once the workers gathered around he detonated the vehicle . The Islamic State also known as ISIS or ISIL claimed the attack in a statement circulated on a website that is often used by the group . It was the third such attack in three days in or near Baghdad underscoring the lingering threat posed by the extremist group despite a string of setbacks for it elsewhere in the country over the past year including in and around the northern city of Mosul . The attack took place in Sadr City a vast Shiite district in eastern Baghdad that has been repeatedly targeted by Sunni extremists since the 2003 invasion . Militiamen loyal to the Shiite cleric Moktada were seen evacuating bodies in their trucks before ambulances arrived . Bodies were scattered across the bloody pavement alongside fruit vegetables and laborers ’ shovels and axes . A minibus filled with dead passengers was on fire . Asaad Hashim 28 an owner of a nearby cellphone store described how the laborers had pushed and shoved around the bomber ’s vehicle trying to get hired . “ Then a big boom came sending them up into the air ” said Mr. Hashim who suffered shrapnel wounds to his right hand . He blamed “ the most ineffective security forces in the world ” for failing to prevent the attack . An angry crowd cursed the government even after a representative of Mr. Sadr tried to calm them .

" SYDNEY Australia — The annual beach pilgrimage during the height of summer in Melbourne Australia ’s city is threatened by an unsettling phenomenon : shores where the tides are tainted with excrement . The Environment Protection Authority in the state of Victoria said on Monday that heavy rains had caused fecal pollution to wash into Port Phillip from rivers creeks and drains . It advised against swimming at 21 beaches because of poor water quality . “ It ’s poo in all its luxurious forms that is causing the problem ” said Anthony Boxshall the agency ’s manager of applied sciences noting that the waste was coming from people dogs horses cows birds and other animals . Fecal pollution can cause serious health problems including gastroenteritis . Mr. Boxshall said much of the waste had been washed down the Yarra River that runs through Melbourne into Port Phillip affecting the city ’s bayside beaches the most . The agency which takes regular water samples rates beaches . A “ good ” rating means that the water is suitable for swimming . “ Fair ” means that rainfall has affected the water . “ Poor ” means people should avoid it . Residents said that the pollution had deterred them from indulging in a favorite summer ritual . “ When the temperature gets above 86 Fahrenheit Melbournians typically pack the family in the car with food and drink and spend the day at the beach ” said Sam Riley who lives in the city . “ I was going to take my two young boys to the beach myself over the summer but now I ’m concerned about whether the water is clean . ” Mr. Boxshall said any improvement in the beaches ’ water quality was uncertain as long as the rain continued . The agency says it usually takes between 24 and 48 hours for the waters to clear after the rain stops . "
" When the Green Bay Packers lost to the Washington Redskins in Week 11 dropping to Aaron Rodgers vowed to “ run the table ” in a march to the playoffs . With a victory over the Detroit Lions on Sunday night the team fulfilled Rodgers ’ promise . Much of the drama of the matchup between division rivals was eliminated earlier in the day when the Redskins lost to the Giants thus guaranteeing both the Packers and Lions would be playoff teams but the N. F. C. North bragging rights and a home game in the first round of the playoffs were sufficient motivation for Green Bay to push hard enough to secure the team ’s sixth consecutive win and the third consecutive loss for Detroit . Pundits had spent the week deciphering all of the wild scenarios that could play out for positioning among the remaining teams . But when all was said and done ten of the teams that were in line for a playoff spot remained in the same seeding order . No. 6 Detroit Lions at No. 3 Seattle Seahawks Time : 8:15 p. m. Eastern SATURDAY on NBC The Seahawks ’ title hopes took a crushing blow when Earl Thomas was lost for the season with a broken leg . After the injury the Seahawks went with the wins coming with major asterisks as they came against the Rams and 49ers . That collapse paled in comparison to the Lions who lost their final three games blowing what had been a large division lead against Green Bay .

" Mariah Carey suffered through a performance train wreck in Times Square on New Year ’s Eve as malfunctions left her at a loss vocally during her hit song “ Emotions ” struggling to reach notes and to sync the lyrics and music . The trouble continued when she gave up on another of her numbers “ We Belong Together ” while a recording of the song continued to play a confirmation that she had been . But on Sunday a dispute erupted between Ms. Carey ’s representatives and producers of ABC ’s “ Dick Clark ’s New Year ’s Rockin ’ Eve With Ryan Seacrest ” on which the singer was performing . Ms. Carey ’s manager Stella Bulochnikov charged that the show ’s producers had been aware of technical problems but did not fix them — and chose to continue showing Ms. Carey ’s messy performance “ to get ratings . ” “ I will never know the truth but I do know that we told them three times that her mike pack was not working and it was a disastrous production ” Ms. Bulochnikov told Us Weekly magazine on Sunday . “ I ’m certainly not calling the F. B. I. to investigate . It is what it is : New Year ’s Eve in Times Square . Mariah did them a favor . She was the biggest star there and they did not have their ” act together . Dick Clark Productions which produced the show issued a statement on Sunday night saying that Ms. Carey ’s performance woes had nothing to do with the production and that any suggestion that the company “ would ever intentionally compromise the success of any artist is defamatory outrageous and frankly absurd . ” “ In very rare instances there are of course technical errors that can occur with live television ” the statement said adding that an initial investigation suggested that the production company “ had no involvement in the challenges associated with Ms. Carey ’s New Year ’s Eve performance . ” A veteran audio producer Robert Goldstein of Maryland Sound International a company that has worked on the Times Square event for years
" PARIS — When the Islamic State was about to be driven out of the ancient city of Palmyra in March Yves Ubelmann got a call from Syria ’s director of antiquities to come over in a hurry . An architect by training Mr. Ubelmann 36 had worked in Syria before the country was engulfed by war . But now there was special urgency for the kind of work his youthful team of architects mathematicians and designers did from their cramped offices in Paris : producing digital copies of threatened historical sites . Palmyra parts of it already destroyed by the Islamists who deemed these monuments idolatrous was still rigged with explosives . So he and Houmam Saad his Syrian colleague spent four days flying a drone with a robot camera over the crumbled arches and temples . “ Drones with four or six rotors can hover really close and register structural details every crack and hole and we can take very precise measurements ” said Mr. Ubelmann who founded the company Iconem . “ This is the stuff architects and archaeologists need . ” They need it in a new push for virtual preservation that scientists archaeologists and others like Mr. Ubelmann are compiling on a large scale . The records could be used to create computer models that would show how monuments and endangered historical sites might one day be restored repaired or reconstructed . Of special interest today are ancient sites in Syria and also Iraq that have suffered from war

" WASHINGTON — The most powerful and ambitious Congress in 20 years will convene Tuesday with plans to leave its mark on virtually every facet of American life — refashioning the country ’s social safety net wiping out scores of labor and environmental regulations and unraveling some of the most significant policy prescriptions put forward by the Obama administration . Even before Donald J. Trump is sworn in on Jan. 20 giving their party full control of the government Republicans plan quick action on several of their top priorities — most notably a measure to clear a path for the Affordable Care Act ’s repeal . Perhaps the first thing that will happen in the new Congress is the push for deregulation . Also up early : filling a Supreme Court seat which is sure to set off a pitched showdown and starting confirmation hearings for Mr. Trump ’s cabinet nominees . “ It ’s a big job to actually have responsibility and produce results ” said Senator Mitch McConnell of Kentucky the majority leader . “ And we intend to do it . ” But as Republicans plan to reserve the first 100 days of Congress for their more partisan goals Democrats are preparing roadblocks . The party ’s brutal wounds have been salted by evidence of Russian election interference Mr. Trump ’s cabinet picks and his taunting Twitter posts . ( On Saturday he offered New Year ’s wishes “ to all ” including “ those who have fought me and lost so badly they just don ’t know what to do . ” ) Obstacles will also come from Republicans who are divided on how to proceed with the health care law and a pledge to rewrite the tax code . Some are also skittish about certain policy proposals like vast changes to Medicare that could prove unpopular among the broad electorate . And any burst of legislative action will come only if Congress can break free of its longstanding tendency toward gridlock . For Republicans the path to this moment has been long and transparently paved — the House in particular has signaled the Republican policy vision through bills it has been passing for years . But many of those measures have gathered dust in the Senate or been doused in veto ink . The cleft between the two chambers recalls the situation faced by the insurgent House Republican majority in the . Speaker Newt Gingrich took control with a determined agenda only to be stymied by the Senate majority leader Bob Dole who stacked conservative House bills like so many fire logs in the back of the Senate chamber . “ They ’ve been given a golden opportunity here
" WASHINGTON — It ’s or time for Republicans . After a tumultuous decade that has seen profound changes in the makeup and character of their party Republicans are poised to complete their slow but steady climb back to power as they seize control of the House Senate and the White House for the first time since 2006 . That political triad will leave them with a splendid opportunity for success . But there is little room for failure if they hope to satisfy their impatient constituents and deliver on bold promises to reshape the nation ’s health care delivery system restructure the tax code drive job creation muscle up American foreign policy rebuild a crumbling infrastructure and set America on a new course . Republicans who will take command of the Senate and House as the 115th Congress convenes on Tuesday have long been itching for a chance to do it their way constantly grousing that President Obama and Congressional Democrats held back American progress and economic growth . Now they must show they can deliver . And they know it . “ When you have both houses and the presidency there is no acceptable excuse for not passing major legislation ” said Representative Tom Cole a senior Republican from Oklahoma . “ There is a lot of pressure on Republican members to produce and to produce quickly . ” That will not be easy . There is a mutual wariness between many Republicans in Congress and Donald J. Trump leaving it unclear how often their interests and priorities will coalesce or collide . Some of the biggest fights might well be between Republicans on Capitol Hill and the White House occupied by a man who campaigned against the establishment and some of the very Republicans running Congress . Republicans must also maneuver while facing slightly expanded Democratic minorities in the House and Senate in a climate that is in many respects even more hostile than it was before the November elections . Democrats remain angry at how Republicans treated President Obama including their refusal to consider the nomination of federal Judge Merrick B. Garland to the United States Supreme Court . Democrats want payback for the cold shoulder given to Mr. Garland ’s nomination to satisfy themselves and to show their supporters that they are not going to roll over for the new Republican government . While they cannot employ the filibuster to block most nominations they still retain it for Supreme Court picks and legislation — at least for now . Perhaps most important Republicans themselves are going to need something of an attitude adjustment . The contemporary Republican Party has been built out of fierce opposition to Mr. Obama and deep disdain for activist government . Nearly of current House Republicans have never served with a Republican president and their entire time in Washington has been spent fighting the executive branch . As a result Republicans have had the luxury of being able to argue for positions that appealed to their conservative base but that they knew would not become law because Senate Democrats would block them or because the president would veto them . Now if they can assemble the votes their ideas will become law — with all the attendant consequences . Republicans who have shied from the responsibility of government will now be called upon to support increases in the debt limit

" The body of the Iraqi prisoner was found naked and badly bruised in 2003 outside a detention center in southern Iraq run by United States Marines . The man had been beaten deprived of sleep forced to stand for long periods and interrogated by Marines about his alleged role in a fatal ambush of American forces . James N. Mattis Donald J. Trump ’s nominee for secretary of defense was then a major general and the commander of the Marine division in Iraq responsible for the center . He quickly convened an inquiry into the death which led to and banned the harsh techniques used at the prison . “ General Mattis was all up in arms over this ” Ralph Dengler then a lieutenant colonel testified at a military hearing in January 2004 . He added that the commander who arrived hours after the discovery on a planned visit with his British counterpart had immediately described the death as “ the worst thing that happened ” under his watch in the Iraq war . “ I was surprised that he would have felt that strongly about it considering many of the other deaths including American deaths ” Colonel Dengler said . Colleagues say the general ’s handling of the episode reflects his firmly held views against torture and prisoner mistreatment which are shared by many military leaders and could put them at odds with the new commander in chief . Mr. Trump in a New York Times interview in late November said he had been surprised to learn that the man he was considering to lead the country ’s 2. 2 million service members did not believe in torture . During the presidential campaign Mr. Trump advocated bringing back the practice of waterboarding adding that “ only a stupid person would say it doesn ’t work . ” General Mattis does not support abusive techniques let alone waterboarding . “ Give me a pack of cigarettes and a couple of beers
" ISTANBUL — The Islamic State on Monday issued a rare claim of responsibility for an attack in Turkey after a New Year ’s Day shooting at an Istanbul nightclub that killed at least 39 people describing the gunman who carried out the assault — and who has not been identified or captured — as “ a hero soldier of the caliphate . ” The Turkish authorities are still searching for the gunman who killed a police officer guarding the Reina nightclub before going on a shooting rampage with a rifle but the state news media reported that eight suspects had been detained in connection with the attack . The authorities on Monday released two photographs of the person suspected of being the gunman captured by security cameras that showed a cleanshaven man in a dark winter coat . The government ’s spokesman Numan Kurtulmus said at a news conference that investigators believed they found the assailant ’s fingerprints and that they were close to identifying him . Mr. Kurtulmus did not mention the Islamic State specifically but he said Turkey would press the fight against terrorism . Referring to the attack which happened just after midnight on Sunday morning Mr. Kurtulmus said : “ The fact that it was done during the first minutes of 2017 gives an important message . The message is ‘ We will go on to menace Turkey in 2017 . ’ And we say to them we will break into your caves wherever you are . ” The Turkish newspaper Hurriyet reported on Monday that the gunman might be from Kyrgyzstan or elsewhere in Central Asia . The Russian news agency Interfax quoted Aiymkan Kulukeyeva a spokeswoman for the Foreign Ministry in Kyrgyzstan as saying “ According to preliminary information this information is doubtful but we are checking all the same . ” The Islamic State asserted in a statement that the attack had been carried out “ in continuation of the blessed operations that the Islamic State is conducting against Turkey the protector of the cross . ” “ A hero soldier of the caliphate attacked one of the most famous nightclubs where Christians celebrated their pagan holiday ” read the statement from the Islamic State
" WASHINGTON — President Obama ’s advisers wrestled with an intractable problem in the spring and summer of 2015 : How could they stabilize Afghanistan while preserving Mr. Obama ’s longtime goal of pulling out the last American troops before he left office ? As it happened the president solved the problem for them . In early August of that year when Mr. Obama convened a meeting of the National Security Council he looked around the table and acknowledged a stark new reality . “ The fever in this room has finally broken ” the president told the group according to a person in the meeting . “ We ’re no longer in mode . ” What Mr. Obama meant was that no one in the Situation Room that day himself included thought that the United States — after 14 years of war billions of dollars spent and more than 2000 American lives lost — would ever transform Afghanistan into a semblance of a democracy able to defend itself . At the same time he added “ the counterterrorism challenges are real . ” As bleak as Afghanistan ’s prospects were the United States could not afford to walk away and allow the country to become a seedbed for extremists again . A few weeks later the president halted the withdrawal and announced that he would leave thousands of American troops in the country indefinitely . It was a crucial turning point in the evolution of Barack Obama . The antiwar candidate of 2008 who had pledged to turn around Afghanistan — the “ good war ” to George W. Bush ’s “ bad war ” in Iraq — had conceded that the longest military operation in American history would not end on his watch . The optimistic president who once thought Afghanistan was winnable had through bitter experience become the commander in chief of a forever war . He remains defensive about the lessons of that journey . “ We shouldn ’t assume that every time a country has problems that it reflects a failure of American policy ” the president said in an interview in September . Now as Mr. Obama prepares to turn the war over to Donald J. Trump a leader even more skeptical than he is about the value of American engagement in foreign conflicts Afghanistan captures the disillusionment of a man who believed as he put it in his 2009 Nobel Peace Prize acceptance speech

" JERUSALEM — Israeli police investigators questioned Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu for three hours at his official residence on Monday evening on suspicion of receiving illicit gifts and favors from business executives . Mr. Netanyahu was questioned “ under caution ” the police said in a statement implying that there were grounds to suspect that Mr. Netanyahu might have committed a criminal offense . “ No further details can be given at this stage ” the statement added . The Ministry of Justice said late Monday that Mr. Netanyahu had been questioned by investigators from Lahav 433 a police fraud investigation and prosecution unit with the authorization of the attorney general Avichai Mandelblit . In a detailed statement the ministry described how the police had gathered testimony from dozens of witnesses some abroad and seized documents during a monthslong graft inquiry . While some aspects of the inquiry did not yield evidence of crimes the statement said other parts warranted a deeper investigation . Mr. Netanyahu who has been subject to police inquiries and investigations in the past that ended without charges has vehemently denied any impropriety . “ This will all come to nothing because there is nothing ” he has said repeatedly of the latest accusations . Local news outlets say the investigators are focused on two separate cases one more serious than the other but they have offered little detail on the more serious one . The less weighty one according to reports in the newspaper Haaretz and other outlets concerns favors for Mr. Netanyahu and possibly for members of his family
" PARIS — If the world does not envy the French enough already for their generous vacations universal health care and fine food and wine the arrival of 2017 brings this : a newly created “ right to disconnect . ” Though ridiculed in some quarters as a ban on email after hours it is not quite that . But it is born of the enlightened view that it is actually beneficial for people not to work all the time and that workers have the right to occasionally draw the line when their employer ’s demands intrude on evenings at home treasured vacations or Sundays with friends and family . “ Employees are more and more connected during hours outside of the office ” Myriam El Khomri the minister of labor said last year in justifying the need for the law . “ The boundary between professional and personal life has become tenuous ” and cases of burnout are becoming more prevalent she said . The measure is one of a raft of new laws that took effect with the beginning of the new year and that exemplify the search for compromises between preserving French traditions and making concessions to the realities of the modern world . The new provision in the labor law does not ban emails but does require that companies with more than 50 employees negotiate a new protocol to ensure that work does not spill into days off or hours . Some consultants have recommended that employees and managers avoid the “ reply all ” function on emails to groups so that only one person is being asked to read an email and respond rather than half the office . Another approach recommends setting a time each evening after which employees are not expected to reply — several firms have designated the 10 hours between 9 p. m. and 7 a. m. others the 12 hours between 7 p. m. and 7 a. m. As a country with Catholic roots but also a commitment to personal liberties France has had an ambivalent approach to divorce . It has long been legal but not necessarily speedy . A new nod to modernity in French laws eases the rules for people who want to divorce . While historically France has been far more flexible than Ireland or Italy it still required a judge to rule on each divorce . The procedure routinely took as long as a year and sometimes far longer because cases were backed up awaiting the judicial signature . Now if both members of the couple agree on the divorce
1.0"OTTAWA — It was 7 a. m. and 99 passengers and six crew members were aboard a 737 on the tarmac at Calgary International Airport bound for a sunny holiday in Cancun Mexico . There was one problem however . The flight ’s captain was passed out in the cockpit apparently from drinking . The police in Calgary Alberta arrested the pilot Miroslav Gronych 37 on Saturday and have charged him with two offenses . “ This is a new one and obviously this had a very significant potential to cause great harm had the pilot actually been allowed to fly this plane ” Staff Sgt. Paul Stacey of the Calgary Police Service said at a news conference . “ There ’s just so many checks and balances it just doesn ’t surprise me that he got caught before this plane was able to leave the gate . ” Nevertheless Inspector Ken Thrower the commander of the Calgary Police Service ’s traffic and airport unit said his officers along with airport officials and inspectors from Transport Canada the aviation regulator will begin trying to figure out how the pilot managed to pass through several checkpoints
" RIO DE JANEIRO — A prison riot involving gangs vying for supremacy over the cocaine trade in the Brazilian Amazon left at least 56 people dead the authorities in the city of Manaus said on Monday . Riots at Brazil ’s prisons are common but the episode in Manaus which involved decapitated bodies being thrown over the walls of the penitentiary ranks among the bloodiest in recent decades . Officials expressed dismay over the scenes of slaughter in the Compaj prison which held more than 1200 inmates about triple its official capacity . “ I never saw anything like this in my life ” Judge Luís Carlos Valois who helped negotiate an end to the riot said in a Facebook post . He said that dozens of people had been killed but that it was challenging to arrive at a precise count : “ There were lots of bodies . Many of them were dismembered . ” The riot flared on Sunday and lasted about 17 hours raising fears of even greater violence on the streets of Manaus the largest city in the Amazon basin with a population of about 2. 1 million . Manaus has emerged as a brutal battleground between two prison gangs that are contesting control of the drug trade in the region . The authorities said that one of the gangs Familia do Norte ( Family of the North ) which operates from the Manaus prisons was responsible for the vast majority of the killings during the riot . The targets were from First Capital Command a much larger rival gang commonly known by its Portuguese initials P. C. C. which has its roots in the prisons of São Paulo in southeast Brazil . “ There were deaths only on one side ” Sérgio Fontes the top security official in Amazonas State told reporters . “ The Familia do Norte massacred members of the First Capital Command
" After the explosion in September of one of its rockets SpaceX is now ready to get back into the business of sending payloads to space the company announced on Monday with its next rocket headed to orbit as soon as Sunday . In a statement SpaceX — or more formally Space Exploration Technologies Corporation — said that an investigation had determined the likely cause : an unexpected interplay of supercold helium and oxygen with carbon fibers and aluminum . The statement Monday added technical details about what went wrong and the company said it had devised workarounds to prevent a recurrence . The cascade of explosions on Sept. 1 that destroyed a Falcon 9 rocket on the launchpad at Cape Canaveral Air Force Station in Florida was perplexing and concerning because it occurred during what is usually regarded as a safer portion of operations — the fueling of propellants — about eight minutes before the ignition of the engines for a planned test . ( The launch had been scheduled for two days later . ) The trouble appeared to start near the liquid oxygen tank on the second stage of the rocket and in less than a tenth of a second that section was in flames followed by the destruction of the entire rocket and a $ 200 million communications satellite whose customers included Facebook which had planned to use it to expand internet services in Africa . Under current federal laws investigations into such explosions are led by the company that built the rocket not by a government agency . The investigation panel included representatives of the Federal Aviation Administration the United States Air Force NASA and the National Transportation Safety Board . Falcon 9 rockets are used to carry NASA cargo to the International Space Station and are to provide transportation for astronauts beginning in 2018 . SpaceX is also competing to win contracts to launch Department of Defense spy satellites . With few obvious clues to the explosion the company initially considered hypotheses like sabotage that a sniper had fired a shot rupturing the oxygen tank from the roof of a competitor ’s building nearby . “ The accident investigation team worked systematically through an extensive fault tree analysis ” SpaceX said in its statement . The investigation narrowed in on three helium containers within the liquid oxygen tank . The containers consist of an aluminum liner with an outer layer of strong carbon fibers . During launch as the liquid oxygen is consumed the helium is heated and released to maintain pressure within the tank . In December 2015
" In the basement of a mammoth old building in Upper Manhattan that houses the Yeshiva University High School for Boys sits a cramped gym that is home to the high school ’s floor hockey team known as the Lions . The school calls the gym the Lions ’ Den but many visitors call it the Dungeon and liken playing there to playing hockey inside a box . Games are raucous affairs with rough play and frenzied fans squeezed onto the narrow bleachers at one end between the squads of panting players . Several miles away in the Riverdale neighborhood of the Bronx is the comparatively luxurious indoor rink at the Salanter Akiba Riverdale High School known as S. A. R. With its sturdy boards and rounded sides the rink resembles a real ice hockey surface . Its scoreboard is flanked by American and Israeli flags . Between these two extremes exists the but thriving world of interscholastic floor hockey at yeshiva high schools in New York City and surrounding towns . The game in these Orthodox Jewish private schools stretches back at least to the late 1970 s but in recent years it has grown enormously popular . The championship match can fill an arena with as many as 1000 fans with more people watching live online . Players in elementary grades at Jewish schools now set their sights on yeshivas with the most powerful hockey programs . “ Outside the Orthodox community this is a foreign thing ” said Amir Gavarin 22 a former floor hockey league player . “ But inside it ’s a whole world unto itself and supercompetitive . ” The teams play in the Metropolitan Yeshiva High School Hockey League which includes 18 varsity and 15 junior varsity teams for boys . There are also 12 girls ’ teams which play in the spring season . The game is similar to ice hockey but played on foot on a gym floor with a hard orange ball and squads made up of a goalie and four roaming players . Goalies wear full padding

1.0"WASHINGTON — It was supposed to be a triumphant morning for Republicans on Capitol Hill — a moment to demonstrate the merits of unified party rule in the age of Donald J. Trump . By noon party leaders had a message for their charges : It was not going smoothly . The day after House Republicans voted to eliminate an independent ethics body members returned to work on Tuesday to find their offices inundated with angry missives from constituents amid a national uproar . By midmorning Mr. Trump had weighed in questioning the members ’ priorities on Twitter . Shortly after lawmakers were summoned to the basement of the Capitol for a hastily convened meeting with Republican leaders . Representative Kevin McCarthy of California the majority leader — who along with Speaker Paul D. Ryan had opposed the proposal — lobbed a pointed question at his fellow Republicans according to two people present : Had they campaigned on repealing the Affordable Care Act or tinkering with an ethics office ? Minutes later members emerged to say the changes had been scrapped . The reversal came less than 24 hours after House Republicans meeting in a secret session voted to curtail the powers of the Office of Congressional Ethics an independent body created in 2008 after a series of scandals involving House lawmakers including three who were sent to jail . It was part of a turbulent opening for the Trump era in Washington marked by a Republican push in the Senate to repeal the Affordable Care Act . House Republicans led by Representative Robert W. Goodlatte of Virginia had sought on Monday to prevent the office from pursuing investigations that might result in criminal charges . Instead

" WASHINGTON — The Congress opened the turbulent Trump era in Washington on Tuesday as the new Senate moved instantly to begin the repeal of President Obama ’s signature health care law while the House descended into chaos in an attempt to gut an independent congressional ethics office . On a day usually reserved for pomp constitutionally mandated procedure and small children parading around in fancy dresses Congress instead pitched itself into partisan battles . Speaker Paul D. Ryan easily won but not before the embarrassment of having his members defy him by voting to eliminate the ethics office only to then abandon that effort after a flood of criticism from constituents and Twitter messages from Donald J. Trump that criticized House Republican priorities . It was a rocky start to a period in which Republicans had promised an end to Washington gridlock if they controlled both Congress and the White House . There was intraparty conflict and a sense that Mr. Trump who ran against the Republican establishment would continue to be openly critical of his own party at times . As Democrats in both chambers seethed Senator Mitch McConnell of Kentucky the majority leader unveiled the legislative language that could decimate the Affordable Care Act before the crocuses start to bloom in the spring even if any replacement of the law could take years . Budget language released on Tuesday gives House and Senate committees only until Jan. 27 to produce legislation that would eliminate major parts of the health care law . Under arcane budget procedures that legislation would be protected from a Democratic filibuster and could pass the Senate with a simple majority . And debate will begin on Wednesday before senators have even moved into their new offices . The dueling over the health law ’s fate will pull in both the departing and incoming White House administrations as well . On Wednesday Mr. Obama will visit with congressional Democrats to plot how to resist the planned repeal and Mike Pence the vice will meet with Republicans to gird them for the fight ahead . While the Senate action showed Republicans on course to keep campaign promises the House got off to a messy start brought on by Republicans who had moved largely in secret on Monday to gut a congressional ethics office against Mr. Ryan ’s wishes . That provoked an outcry from both Democrats and voters who flooded House offices with angry calls . “ Every organization is calling my office ” said Representative Pete Sessions Republican of Texas . “ And we ’ve told them : ‘ Thank you very much . We appreciate your feedback . ’ ” After a hastily called meeting on Tuesday morning among Republicans the matter was dropped before it could go to the full House floor for a vote . As the Senate moved to larger legislative matters
" WASHINGTON — Donald J. Trump on Tuesday named as his chief trade negotiator a Washington lawyer who has long advocated protectionist policies the latest sign that Mr. Trump intends to fulfill his campaign promise to get tough with China Mexico and other trading partners . Mr. Trump also renewed his episodic campaign to persuade American companies to expand domestic manufacturing criticizing General Motors via Twitter on Tuesday morning for making in Mexico some of the Chevrolet Cruze hatchbacks it sells domestically . Hours later Mr. Trump claimed credit after Ford said it would expand vehicle production in Flat Rock Mich . The choice of Robert Lighthizer ( pronounced ) to be the United States ’ trade representative nearly completes Mr. Trump ’s selection of top economic advisers and taken together with the ’s running commentary on Twitter underscores Mr. Trump ’s focus on making things in America . That is causing unease among some Republicans who regard Mr. Trump ’s views on trade as dangerously retrograde even as they embrace the bulk of his economic agenda . Mainstream economists warn that protectionist policies like import taxes could impose higher prices on consumers and slow economic growth . But some Democrats are signaling a readiness to support Mr. Trump . Nine House Democrats held a news conference Tuesday with the A. F. L. . I. O. president Richard Trumka to urge renegotiation of the North American Free Trade Agreement with Mexico and Canada . “ We wanted him to know that we ’ll work with him on doing that ” Mr. Trumka said . “ I don ’t think he has enough Republican support to do it and rewriting the rules of trade is a necessary first step in righting the economy for working people . ” Mr. Trump and his top advisers on trade including Mr. Lighthizer share a view that the United States in recent decades prioritized the ideal of free trade over its own . They argue that other countries are undermining America ’s industrial base by subsidizing their own export industries while impeding American importers . They regard this unfair competition as a key reason for the lackluster growth of the economy . In picking Mr. Lighthizer who has spent much of the last few decades representing American steel producers in their frequent litigation of trade disputes Mr. Trump is seeking to hire one of Washington ’s top trade lawyers to enforce international trade agreements more vigorously . He must be confirmed by the Senate . “ He will do an amazing job helping turn around the failed trade policies which have robbed so many Americans of prosperity ” Mr. Trump said in a statement . Mainstream Republicans have sought common ground with Mr. Trump emphasizing for example
" ■ Donald J. Trump appears to side with the WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange over United States intelligence agencies with Vice Mike Pence backing him up . ■ She ’s hired : Omarosa Manigault gets a White House post as do some notable Trump loyalists . But Mr. Trump is leaning on Republican veterans in the Oval Office ’s top slots . ■ The finds something “ very strange ” about his intelligence briefing on Friday — even though the White House says it was always planned for Friday . For the Republican Party Mr. Assange the WikiLeaks founder was once purely a villain . He found little sympathy with conservatives after he leaked American military secrets from Iraq published purloined diplomatic cables that could have gotten American sources killed and sought refuge in the Ecuadorean Embassy in London fleeing charges of rape . But now Mr. Trump appears to be siding with Mr. Assange over the conclusions of America ’s intelligence services . Mr. Assange appeared on Fox News on Tuesday night with Sean Hannity one of Mr. Trump ’s biggest news media boosters to declare once again that the Russians were not the source of the purloined emails that WikiLeaks released from the Democratic National Committee and the personal account of Hillary Clinton ’s campaign chairman John Podesta . Mr. Trump followed that appearance with a series of Twitter posts on Wednesday that appeared to be preparing his followers for battle once more information on intelligence findings was released most likely by Thursday . There were actually two separate hackings that the Obama administration has said came from Russian intelligence — with “ 100 percent ” certainty . As he has previously Mr. Assange said : “ Our source is not the Russian government . It is not state parties . ” But Mr. Assange has often said that the organization does not always know the identity of its sources . It is highly unlikely that anyone approaching WikiLeaks with the emails obtained by Russian government hacking would acknowledge the source so it is likely that Mr. Assange cannot be sure of the origin of the emails . Mr. Assange and Mr. Hannity did not address that in addition to WikiLeaks the leaked Democratic material was published by two mysterious websites DCLeaks . com and a blog written by someone called Guccifer 2. 0 . American intelligence agencies say they believe both were created by Russian agents . In addition to American intelligence agencies most private researchers also say they believe that the D. N. C. and Podesta hackings were carried out on orders of Russian government officials though a few skeptics say they believe the case is unproven by the evidence made public . Mr. Assange ’s statement is unlikely to change that conclusion . Intelligence officials will brief Congress on their Russia inquiry on Thursday
" LOS ANGELES — Girding for four years of potential battles with Donald J. Trump Democratic leaders of the California Legislature announced Wednesday that they had hired Eric H. Holder Jr . who was attorney general under President Obama to represent them in any legal fights against the new Republican White House . The decision by the Legislature to retain Mr. Holder who is now a prominent Washington lawyer is the latest sign of the ideological battle that may play out over the next four years between this predominantly Democratic state and Washington . Hillary Clinton the Democratic candidate for president defeated Mr. Trump by more than four million votes here . “ Having the former attorney general of the United States brings us a lot of firepower in order to prepare to safeguard the values of the people of California ” Kevin de León the Democratic leader of the Senate said in an interview . “ This means we are very very serious . ” Mr. de León said he expected California to challenge Washington — and defend itself from policies instituted in Washington — on issues including the environment immigration and criminal justice . He said California Democrats decided to turn to Mr. Holder as they watched Mr. Trump assemble his cabinet and begin to set the tone for his presidency . “ It was very clear that it wasn ’t just campaign rhetoric ” Mr. de León said of Mr. Trump ’s proposals over the past year . “ He was surrounding himself with people who are a very clear and present danger to the economic prosperity of California . ” Mr. Trump did not immediately return requests for comment . The move by Mr. de León and his Democratic counterpart in the Assembly Anthony Rendon follows Gov. Jerry Brown ’s appointment of Representative Xavier Becerra as attorney general last month to succeed Kamala D. Harris who was elected to the United States Senate . That appointment made Mr. Becerra one of the Latino officials in this state and he is expected to be instrumental in battling with the Trump White House over any attempt to enforce stringent measures aimed at immigrants . Mr. Brown has made clear that he intends to challenge the administration on global warming and that his attorney general will be a key to that battle . The Democratic Party controls of both the Assembly and the Senate in California . Every statewide elected official is a Democrat . Mr. Holder was Mr. Obama ’s attorney general from 2009 to 2015 . He was the first to hold that position . He is a partner at Covington Burling a law firm in Washington that specializes in representing states and companies against the federal government . “ I am honored that the Legislature chose Covington to serve as its legal adviser as it considers how to respond to potential changes in federal law that could impact California ’s residents and policy priorities ” Mr. Holder said in a statement . “ I am confident that our expertise across a wide array of federal legal and regulatory issues will be a great resource to the Legislature . ” The Legislature has an ample stable of lawyers on staff but officials said Mr. Holder and his firm brought specific litigation and political skills that could be needed in the coming years . Mr. de León said the final compensation for the firm had not been set
" JERUSALEM — The fate of just one Israeli soldier was hanging in the balance . But for many Israelis the guilty verdict announced on Wednesday was a critical turn in the battle for the character of the state . When the military judges convicted Sgt. Elor Azaria of manslaughter for shooting a Palestinian assailant in the head as he lay wounded on the ground they were ruling not just on his conduct but also on the host of ethical and political issues it raised . Since the shooting in the occupied West Bank city of Hebron in March the case has polarized Israelis and rocked the pedestal on which the military normally stands . With the 50th anniversary of Israel ’s occupation of the West Bank approaching the highly charged trial had fueled a debate about military ethics and the place of the army in Israeli society . The verdict did little to heal the rifts the trial had exposed : Hours after it was rendered Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu joined a chorus of voices calling for the soldier to be pardoned . “ This is a difficult and painful day for us all ” Mr. Netanyahu said in a Facebook post supporting a pardon which can be granted by Israel ’s president or the army ’s top officials . Referring to the Israel Defense Forces he added “ The soldiers of the I. D. F. are our sons and daughters and they need to remain above any dispute . ” Prof. David Enoch an expert in the philosophy of law at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem said he thought the manslaughter conviction was “ justified ” but added “ I ’m not sure this verdict will be welcomed by many of the soldiers and much of the public . ” The military ’s rules make clear that assailants must be quickly incapacitated but that once the threat is neutralized they should not be killed . Rights groups and other critics have accused Israeli soldiers and police officers of being too quick to pull the trigger particularly in response to a recent spate of deadly stabbings shootings and car attacks by Palestinians . The Hebron killing caught in chilling completeness in a video that quickly went viral worldwide for many critics crystallized the question of excessive force and even military leaders said Sergeant Azaria acted without justification . But in Israel
" Stuck at your work desk ? Standing up and walking around for five minutes every hour during the workday could lift your mood combat lethargy without reducing focus and attention and even dull hunger pangs according to an instructive new study . The study which also found that frequent brief walking breaks were more effective at improving than a single longer walk before work could provide the basis for a simple realistic New Year ’s exercise resolution for those of us bound to our desks all day . There is growing evidence of course that long bouts of uninterrupted sitting can have undesirable physical and emotional consequences . Studies have shown that sitting motionless reduces blood flow to the legs increasing the risk for atherosclerosis the buildup of plaques in the arteries . People who sit for more than eight or nine hours daily which for many of us describes a typical workday also are at heightened risk for diabetes depression and obesity compared with people who move more often . In response researchers and some bosses have proposed a variety of methods for helping people reduce their sitting time at work including standing workstations and treadmill desks . But such options are cumbersome and costly making them impractical for many work situations . Some experts have worried too that if people are physically active at the office
" It ’s that time of year when financial advice sites issue their lists of the “ Stocks to Buy for 2017 . ” Before you take them up on their suggestions let ’s look at how well such portfolios did in 2016 . The portfolios of stocks they were telling you to buy generally did much worse than the stock market over all . The results underline what many personal finance experts recommend : Invest in a broad mutual index fund . ( The Times ’s “ Your Money ” columnist wrote more on this here . ) In 2016 the broad S. P. stock index increased 9. 5 percent . But if you invested in Forbes ’s 2016 list your money grew about 7 percent . Kiplinger ’s was about half that . A list that appeared on the Money magazine site garnered 4. 9 percent and Barron ’s returned 5. 3 percent . One such list at CNBC did a little better than most at 10 . 6 percent . But Vanguard ’s Total Stock index fund returned 12 . 5 percent in the same period . We even calculated these returns by assuming that any of the dividends were reinvested but still none beat the widely owned index fund . There is nothing wrong with these lists if you are using them as mere suggestions of what companies might be worth investigating . There were some bona fide winners on almost every list : Goldman Sachs Kennametal Ellie Mae Douglas Dynamics Burlington Stores . You might not have heard of some of those companies so it ’s not a bad place to look for ideas . But the problem with such lists is that they encourage people to approach investing the wrong way . Unsophisticated investors are being persuaded that they should own a sheaf of stocks . But as you can see even when the stocks are recommended by professional money managers and filtered through some of the best financial journalists they don ’t do as well as the averages . The best advice remains the same : If you have money you want to play with go have some fun with a few stocks that you can monitor closely . If you keep it simple it ’s easier to track and respond . But for the rest of us the smart investment is those index funds . They cost less than stocks or other funds . They remove most of the emotion from your decision making which is the cause of a lot of bad decisions . That ’s your best bet in 2017 . "
" For Megyn Kelly the shift from Fox News to NBC — where she will host a daily daytime show and a Sunday newsmagazine program — will be a test of whether she can connect with a broader audience in a different format and reach another level of television stardom . But her move announced Tuesday has broader implications for the television news industry raising new questions about the future of Fox News where she was a countervailing presence in an opinion lineup heavy with ideology and of NBC News which has been a longtime bête noire for conservative press critics . And it comes as all news organizations gird for a new era of media coverage that arrives Jan. 20 with the inauguration of Donald J. Trump . The Murdoch family which controls Fox News ’s parent company 21st Century Fox had become so invested in Ms. Kelly as a franchise that they were prepared to pay her a salary of more than $ 20 million a year . People inside and outside the network widely took that to mean the Murdochs were staking the network ’s future on a journalist who effectively made her name by upending the expectations for a Fox News anchor — for instance by publicly taking on the Republican nominee for president . But now Fox News long the cable news ratings leader and an influential voice in the national political debate is on course to begin coverage of a new administration with no anchor with Ms. Kelly ’s history of challenging Mr. Trump . Her show “ The Kelly File ” was sandwiched between the program of Bill O’Reilly — she was regularly second to him in the cable news ratings — and that of Mr. Trump ’s major booster Sean Hannity . Her departure coming after that of Greta Van Susteren also means that Fox faces the prospect of having no female host in prime time . That is a potentially troubling development for the network as its seeks to move past last summer‘s sexual harassment scandal involving its and former chairman Roger Ailes
" Megyn Kelly ’s new office at NBC News sits a block north of Fox News headquarters in Midtown Manhattan . But it might as well be a world away . In switching networks at a pivotal point in her career Ms. Kelly the No. personality in cable television news is taking a calculated risk that she can swap her dedicated Fox audience for the broader but more fickle viewership of network television . There are challenges from the . Her splashy arrival has the potential to fray nerves among the big personalities at the network — who already compete against one another for interviews and scoops . Ms. Kelly 46 will also be taking on a daytime talk show format that has been a virtual graveyard for television news personalities in the last 10 years . And the new Sunday newsmagazine show that NBC plans to build around Ms. Kelly will go up against a giant that has not been meaningfully challenged for decades : “ 60 Minutes ” on CBS . Still Ms. Kelly is a bona fide star with a book and a breakout role in this year ’s presidential campaign when she clashed with Donald J. Trump . NBC News comes out the winner in one of the most closely watched talent sweepstakes in years acquiring one of television ’s biggest names who could play a role in any number of major network events like coverage of elections or the Olympics . Interviews on Tuesday with network executives and producers — from Fox NBC and other rival channels — suggest that Ms. Kelly ’s performance at NBC will be as closely watched in the industry as her past few months of contract negotiations . Ms. Kelly will have to design her daytime talk show from scratch . Even though she made her name as a news anchor she has argued that she is not obsessed with politics . When she hosted a special on Fox in May — her first major foray outside cable news — she expressed a desire to combine the qualities of Oprah Winfrey Barbara Walters and Charlie Rose . That special — which featured interviews with Mr. Trump the celebrity lawyer Robert Shapiro and the actress Laverne Cox — received middling reviews . It was far from a ratings hit : Among adults younger than 50 the demographic most important to broadcasters Ms. Kelly ’s special performed about as well as ABC ’s “ Beyond the Tank ” a spinoff . A daily daytime talk show also poses risks . talent like Jane Pauley Meredith Vieira Katie Couric and Anderson Cooper have taken a stab at the genre in the past
" QINGYUAN China — The 48 soccer fields of the vast Evergrande Football School in south China seem barely enough for its 2800 students . Against a backdrop of school spires that seem modeled on Hogwarts the young athletes swarm onto the fields nearly every day kicking dribbling and passing in the hope of soccer glory and riches . “ Soccer will be my career after I grow up ” Wang Kai a gangly who has studied at the boarding school for over three years said after a morning session under the supervision of a Spanish coach . “ I want to be the Chinese Cristiano Ronaldo ” he said referring to the Portuguese superstar . Grooming the next Ronaldo or Messi has become a national project in China where the country ’s No. 1 fan President Xi Jinping is bent on transforming the country into a great soccer power . It is a moonshot for China whose teams have ranked poor to middling in recent international competition . But the effort has already unleashed a surge of spending and support for the game that has stunned fans and players around the world . In the last two weeks the main Chinese league has plucked foreign stars from Europe and South America with contracts reported to be worth as much as $ 40 million a year the highest pay for any soccer player in the world . A Chinese club offered the real Ronaldo $ 105 million a year but he declined his agent said last week . These giddying sums are shaking the landscape of pro soccer . Antonio Conte the manager of England ’s fabled Chelsea team denounced the Chinese spending spree last month as a “ danger for all teams in the world . ” The drive to match China ’s economic ascent with success on the soccer field has become emblematic of Mr. Xi ’s ambition to transform China into a great and confident power . “ My biggest hope for Chinese soccer is that its teams become among the world ’s best
" In the technology industry the sharks have never long been safe from the minnows . Over much of the last 40 years the biggest players in tech — from IBM to to Cisco to Yahoo — were eventually outmaneuvered by that came out of nowhere . The dynamic is so dependable that it is often taken to be a kind of axiom . To grow large in this business is also to grow slow blind and dumb to become closed off from the very sources of innovation that turned you into a shark in the first place . Then in the last half decade something strange happened : The sharks began to get bigger and smarter . Nearly a year ago I argued that we were witnessing a new era in the tech business one that is typified less by the storied in a garage than by a posse I like to call the Frightful Five : Amazon Apple Facebook Microsoft and Alphabet Google ’s parent company . Together the Five compose a new superclass of American corporate might . For much of last year their further rise and domination over the rest of the global economy looked not just plausible but also maybe even probable . In 2017 much the same story remains but there is a new wrinkle : The world ’s governments are newly motivated to take on the tech giants . In the United States Europe Asia and South America the Five find themselves increasingly arrayed against legal and regulatory powers and often even against popular will . The precise nature of the fights varies by company and region
" BEIJING — A city official in southwest China unleashed a barrage of gunfire on the city ’s mayor and Communist Party secretary during a meeting on Wednesday injuring them before fleeing and killing himself the official news media reported . Privately owned guns are rare in China because of a virtual ban on civilian use and grisly attacks on officials by colleagues are also uncommon . So rumors of the shooting in Panzhihua an industrial city in Sichuan Province rippled quickly across the Chinese internet even before the local authorities confirmed the news . Panzhihua was built as part of Mao ’s plans to relocate factories deep inland where they would be protected from a feared war . But the violence in this isolated site was nonetheless an embarrassing breach of the efforts by China ’s president Xi Jinping to remake officialdom into a clean impeccably disciplined bureaucracy . Details were sparse and there were no clues to the gunman ’s motives . But the brief initial report in the state media sketched a scene of the head of the Panzhihua Land and Resources Bureau Chen Zhongshu bursting into a meeting at an exhibition center and opening fire on officials there . “ The gunman stormed into the meeting fired repeatedly at the main leading comrades of the city party committee and government and then fled ” said an online report by Sichuan Daily an official provincial newspaper citing the Panzhihua government press office . The suspect in the shooting Mr. Chen was found dead in the exhibition center . He had taken his own life
" A steep drop in gang violence last year drove shootings in New York City to the lowest number in at least a Police Department data shows a result of what police officials say has been a focus on gang takedowns and targeted arrests in some of the city ’s roughest neighborhoods . The internal police data obtained by The New York Times paints a detailed portrait of the motives locations and circumstances behind murders and shootings for the last two years . shootings fell to 412 in 2016 from 560 the year before according to the data which tracked shootings and murders through Dec. 28 of each year . killings dropped to 79 in 2016 from 129 in 2015 . Those helped push citywide shootings to a new low of 998 by year ’s end police officials said down from 1138 in 2015 . Murders also fell to 335 from 352 the year before . The New York City police commissioner James P. O’Neill has noted the department ’s efforts to push shootings below 1000 for the first time since at least the early 1990 s when the police began keeping similar records . Mr. O’Neill and Mayor Bill de Blasio were expected to discuss those efforts at a news conference in Brooklyn on Wednesday . Scores of gang takedowns this year resulting in about 900 arrests took violent people off the streets and made it more costly to engage in crimes police officials said . “ Precision policing targets those people who are responsible for the violence
" Our new president is a billionaire Ivy League graduate a real estate tycoon a TV star and a son of inherited wealth . But he is no longer by his own calculations a member of the “ elite . ” Nor are the men ( and the few women ) now joining his inner circle — and corporate executives Harvard and Yale alumni Silicon Valley entrepreneurs and Goldman Sachs bankers . The true elite apparently sits elsewhere among those who in Sarah Palin ’s notable 2008 formulation think “ that they ’re — I guess — better than anyone else . ” As an adjective the word “ elite ” still conveys something positive even aspirational : elite athlete elite model elite travel services . But as a noun embodied by actual living people it has become one of the nastiest epithets in American politics . “ Elites have taken all the upside for themselves and pushed the downside to the and Americans ” complains Trump ’s adviser Steve Bannon ( of Harvard Goldman Sachs and Hollywood ) . In this formulation elites are a destructive condescending collective plotting against the beleaguered masses outside their ranks . And in these attacks

" WASHINGTON — Congress opened for battle over the Affordable Care Act on Wednesday as Republicans pushed immediately forward to repeal the health care law and President Obama made a rare trip to Capitol Hill to defend it . The bitterness that has long marked the fight intensified as Republicans seized the opportunity to make good on a central campaign promise to get rid of the law a pledge reinforced on Wednesday by Vice Mike Pence who met with House Republicans not far from where the president gathered with Democrats . The Affordable Care Act Mr. Obama ’s signature health care law has created online insurance marketplaces offered new protections to people seeking health insurance and provided coverage to millions of people near the poverty line through expanded Medicaid . Health policy experts say that system could collapse if Republicans cut off funds for the expanded coverage and end penalties for people who go without health insurance . “ The American people voted decisively for a better future for health care in this country ” Mr. Pence said “ and we are determined to give them that . ” He said that Donald J. Trump would use his executive authority to help make the transition away from the health care law but did not offer specifics . Democrats vowed aggressive resistance however and said they would not participate in drawing up a replacement for the law after the swift efforts to unravel it . Senator Chuck Schumer of New York the new Democratic leader playing off Mr. Trump ’s campaign slogan said repealing the law would “ make America sick again . ” Republicans are using a procedural approach that will allow them to repeal substantial parts of the health care law without Democrats ’ being able to mount a filibuster in the Senate . By a vote of 51 to 48 on Wednesday the Senate took the first step agreeing to take up a budget resolution or blueprint that would clear the way for legislation repealing major provisions of the law . But even as Republicans spoke of moving quickly to repeal the law it remained far less clear how and when they would go about replacing it . Senate debate on the budget resolution is expected to continue for several days and the House plans to take up the measure once the Senate has approved it . As Republicans charged ahead
" WASHINGTON — Republicans hope to repeal major parts of the Affordable Care Act using an expedited procedure known as budget reconciliation . The process is sometimes called arcane but it has been used often in the past 35 years to write some of the nation ’s most important laws . “ Reconciliation is probably the most potent budget enforcement tool available to Congress for a large portion of the budget ” the Congressional Research Service a nonpartisan arm of Congress has said . Here is a primer . Q. What is the budget reconciliation process ? A. It is a way for Congress to speed action on legislation that changes taxes or spending especially spending for entitlement programs like Medicare and Medicaid . Although conceived primarily as a way to reduce federal budget deficits it has also been used to cut taxes and to create programs that increase spending — changes that can raise deficits . In the Senate a reconciliation bill can ordinarily be passed with a simple majority . For other bills a majority is often needed to limit debate and move to a final vote . Q. Why is it called reconciliation ? A. The term originated in the Congressional Budget and Impoundment Control Act of 1974 which was intended to give Congress more control over the budget process by allowing lawmakers to set overall levels of spending and revenue . The process begins with a budget blueprint a resolution that guides Congress but is not presented to the president for a signature or veto . It recommends federal revenue deficit debt and spending levels in areas like defense energy education and health care . The resolution may direct one or more committees to develop legislation to achieve specified budgetary results . By adopting these proposals Congress can change existing laws so that actual revenue and spending are brought into line with — reconciled with — policies in the budget resolution . Q. How has reconciliation been used ? A. Since 1980 Congress has completed action on 24 budget reconciliation bills . Twenty became law . Four were vetoed . The Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1981 was a vehicle for much of the “ Reagan revolution . ” It squeezed savings out of Social Security Medicare Medicaid food stamps the school lunch program
" WASHINGTON — Majorities in Congress often overreach but usually not on the very first day . House Republicans on the verge of a Washington takeover as the new Congress convened Tuesday couldn ’t stop themselves from trying to dilute the power of a despised ethics watchdog as their first order of business . In the process they created an unsightly spectacle that pretty much ruined an celebration of unified Republican government undermined their own leadership and perhaps foretold the shape of things to come . House Republicans take a stand on a contentious issue Donald J. Trump turns to Twitter to break with House Republicans then Republicans frantically reverse course . “ Mr. Trump campaigned that he was going to drain the swamp and here we are on Day 1 trying to fill the swamp ” Representative Walter B. Jones Republican of North Carolina said after he and his colleagues hurriedly jettisoned a plan seen as a brazen attempt to weaken an independent ethics office that some felt had been unfair to lawmakers . “ That is not a good way to start . ” Deluged by angry phone calls and bad headlines chagrined Republican officials say they were well on their way to abandoning the ethics revisions adopted Monday night in a party meeting before Mr. Trump weighed in via Twitter and suggested that the overhaul shouldn ’t be a top priority urging Republicans to focus instead on taxes and health care . But the final decision did come after the ’s Twitter posts underscoring his sway over House Republicans who had moved ahead despite objections and warnings about the optics of the change from Speaker Paul D. Ryan and Representative Kevin McCarthy of California the majority leader . House Republicans might have amusedly applauded Mr. Trump ’s cutting tweets when they were aimed at the news media and other common foes but they found them measurably less funny when the criticisms were directed their way raising alarms among Republicans about his power to corral them via social media . Following the decision to reverse course several lawmakers were quietly fretting that Mr. Trump ’s megaphone was much more powerful than they had realized . Other Republicans both on and off Capitol Hill were wondering how the proposal got as far as it did given the stated reservations of Mr. Ryan and Mr. McCarthy among others . They said it did not bode well that the rank and file was so willing to ignore leadership on such a potentially critical matter
" WASHINGTON — Ivanka Trump who is weighing a prominent role in her father ’s administration is planning to move with her family to a mansion in the exclusive Kalorama section of Washington two people familiar with the decision said Wednesday . The house was previously owned by a financier with extensive investments in Russia and ties to a Russian opposition leader . Ms. Trump and her husband Jared Kushner a close adviser to Donald J. Trump who is expected to be an influential voice in the administration have chosen a house just around the corner from President Obama ’s new home . The newly renovated house with its sleekly modern décor sold for $ 5. 5 million in December the people said insisting on anonymity because the transaction was private . The home was previously owned by Dan K. Rapoport and his wife Irina according to property records filed with the District of Columbia . Neither responded to emailed requests for comment . Ms. Trump ’s relocation plans first reported by Washingtonian magazine are the latest evidence that she and Mr. Kushner will remain major players in Mr. Trump ’s administration . Both played crucial roles in his presidential bid and have wielded outsize power during his transition . People close to the couple declined to comment on their impending move as did William F. X. Moody a at Washington Fine Properties who first disclosed the deal . But in the neighborhood where they are planning to live — of ambassadors and prominent figures on the Washington social circuit — residents have been buzzing about their neighbors . “ Everybody ’s atwitter about it ” said Tony Podesta chairman of the Podesta Group a top Washington lobbying firm . “ I ’ve been getting lots of emails saying
" The Wall Street lawyer Walter J. Clayton does not travel in political circles nor is he well known in corporate America . He is the insider ’s insider — a deal maker . As such his nomination to lead the Securities and Exchange Commission is a strong signal that financial regulation in the Trump administration will emphasize helping companies raise capital in the public markets over tightening regulation . In contrast the agency ’s two chairwomen under President Obama had regulatory or enforcement backgrounds . Mr. Clayton known as Jay has spent nearly his entire career in corporate boardrooms . His regulatory experience stems from advising banks on dealings with the government and helping several financial institutions with their settlements related to mortgage securities . He had a seat to the financial crisis advising Barclays Capital in buying the assets of the bankrupt Lehman Brothers in 2008 and Bear Stearns in its fire sale to JPMorgan Chase in 2007 . He has advised on mergers and initial public offerings including the biggest ever the $ 25 billion offering by Alibaba Group of China in 2013 . If Mr. Clayton is confirmed he may have to recuse himself from some matters . A similar scrutiny was applied to Mary Jo White the agency ’s current chairwoman . She had been a litigator at Debevoise Plimpton where her clients included JPMorgan Chase Rupert Murdoch ’s News Corporation and Kenneth D. Lewis a former Bank of America chief executive . Still such recusals are not unusual . Laura S. Unger a former commissioner and acting chairwoman said that during her tenure she had to recuse herself from a number of matters before the commission . She said the process of deciding when to recuse oneself often took place in consultation with the commission ’s ethics officer . “ An ethics officer at the S. E. C. knows all of your intimate details and the ethics officer flags for you what may be potential conflicts ” she noted . Yet Mr. Clayton ’s nomination will be sure to fuel criticism that Goldman Sachs could wield too much influence in the Trump administration . Sullivan Cromwell where Mr. Clayton is a partner
1.0"CHARLESTON S. C. — Seeming to abdicate one of his last chances to save his own life the convicted killer Dylann S. Roof stood on Wednesday before the jurors who will decide his fate and offered no apology no explanation and no remorse for massacring nine black churchgoers during a Bible study session in June 2015 . Instead in a strikingly brief opening statement in the sentencing phase of his federal death penalty trial Mr. Roof repeatedly assured the jury that he was not mentally ill — undercutting one of the few mitigating factors that could work in his favor — and left it at that . “ Other than the fact that I trust people that I shouldn ’t and the fact that I ’m probably better at constantly embarrassing myself than anyone who ’s ever existed there ’s nothing wrong with me psychologically ” Mr. Roof who is representing himself told the jury which found him guilty last month of the killings at Charleston ’s Emanuel African Methodist Episcopal Church . Three minutes after walking to the lectern Mr. Roof returned to the defense table exhaling deeply . Any prospects for mercy by the jury had perhaps already been drained by the prosecution ’s disclosure in its opening statement of a white supremacist manifesto written by Mr. Roof in the Charleston County jail sometime in the six weeks after his arrest . “ I would like to make it crystal clear I do not regret what I did ” he wrote in his distinctive scrawl . “ I am not sorry . I have not shed a tear for the innocent people I killed . ” Mr. Roof who was then 21 continued : “ I do feel sorry for the innocent white children forced to live in this sick country and I do feel sorry for the innocent white people that are killed daily at the hands of the lower race . I have shed a tear of for myself . I feel pity that I had to do what I did in the first place . I feel pity that I had to give up my life because of a situation that should never have existed . ” As the government laid out its case for a death sentence the prosecutor who read from the journal
" ISTANBUL — Turkish officials accused the United States of abetting a failed coup last summer . When the Russian ambassador to Turkey was assassinated last month the Turkish press said the United States was behind the attack . And once again after a gunman walked into an Istanbul nightclub early on New Year ’s Day and killed dozens the news media pointed a finger at the United States . “ America Chief Suspect ” one headline blared after the attack . On Twitter a Turkish lawmaker referring to the name of the nightclub wrote : “ Whoever the triggerman is Reina attack is an act of CIA . Period . ” Turkey has been confronted with a cascade of crises that seem to have only accelerated as the Syrian civil war has spilled across the border . But the events have not pushed Turkey closer to its NATO allies . Conversely they have drifted further apart as the nation lashes out at Washington and moves closer to Moscow working with the Russian president Vladimir V. Putin to secure a in Syria . One story in the Turkish press based on a routine travel warning issued by the American Embassy in Turkey was that the United States had advance knowledge of the nightclub attack which the Islamic State later claimed responsibility for . Another suggested that stun grenades used by the gunman had come from stocks held by the American military . Still another claimed the assault was a plot by the United States to sow divisions in Turkey between the secular and the religious . Rather than bringing the United States and Turkey together in the common fight against terrorism the nightclub attack even with the gunman still on the run appears to have only accelerated Turkey ’s shift away from the West at a time when its democracy is eroding amid a growing crackdown on civil society . All of this is a reflection
" BEIRUT Lebanon — For millions of Damascus residents concerns about the direction of the war in Syria have been replaced by worries about where to get enough water to do the dishes wash clothes or take a shower . For nearly two weeks the Syrian capital and its vicinity have been afflicted by a water crisis that has left taps dry caused long lines at wells and forced people to stretch whatever thin resources they can find . “ When the world gets hard for us we work something out ” said a woman in a video posted on Facebook showing how she used a cola bottle to wash teacups . “ When you cut off the water we dig for water . When you cut off the tap we make a tap . ” Like most of Syria ’s problems the Damascus water crisis is a symptom of the war which has killed hundreds of thousands of people displaced about half the country ’s prewar population of 22 million and left its territory divided into zones controlled by the government armed rebels and jihadist groups . While a brokered by Russia and Turkey and announced last week has reduced overall violence across the country it has not stopped the fighting everywhere nor has it resolved what happens when resources needed by one side are controlled by its enemies as appears to be the case with Damascus ’s water . Historically most of the water for the capital which is controlled by the government of President Bashar has come from the Barada Valley north of the city which is controlled by rebels who want to oust Mr. Assad . The crisis began on Dec. 22 when the water stopped flowing . Each side has accused the other of damaging infrastructure near the spring
" Canada our No. 1 pick for this year ’s 52 Places to Go list spans millions of square miles . It also contains multitudes not just of people and locations but of memories . We asked five Canadian authors to reflect on places that have lodged in their psyches . My mother always kept a bright yellow hard hat in her car an unexpected accessory for a petite Hong Kong immigrant in her . She was the senior purchaser for a British Columbia forestry company that in lean years laid off everyone in her department except her . ( More ’s the pity she dreamed of early retirement . ) In the meantime she shuttled between the province ’s pulp and paper mills doing the job of six people negotiating contracts for hotels log loaders harvesters and more . One year when I was 25 I finally said yes to her persistent invitations to tag along . She wanted me to meet the men and women who earned their living in the mill towns and who called her by her English name Matilda . We set out in her car exploring the of Vancouver Island heading for the northern tip Port Hardy . This would turn out to be the last trip we took together . I remember the wet October chill eagles descending over corridors of evergreens a seemingly endless highway . At twilight the world took on the shifting depths of an Emily Carr painting . I had to put up with my mother ’s terrible driving
" For the 12th straight year the Travel section presents its annual Places to Go issue . You will likely have some questions : How did the No. 1 spot get there ? Why is my favorite spot not on the list ? What ’s the deal with those 360 videos online at nytimes . ? Here are some frequently asked questions about how we chose our 52 Places to Go in 2017 . What made Canada the top choice ? And why would you choose a country ? Canada has it all ( O. K. maybe not tropical beaches ) . It ’s a world unto itself with Vancouver Island surf breaks culinary delights in Toronto and Montreal and natural glories of parks like Banff in Alberta . And let ’s face it clichés of Mounties and hockey aside Canada remains a terra incognita for Americans and much of the world . It ’s a great time to correct that as the country celebrates its 150th anniversary this year ( which means free admission all year to those national parks ) and currently offers a generous exchange rate with the United States dollar . What is special about the list online ? And in print ? Look at the interactive version of the list on a computer or mobile device and you ’ll notice a bunch of 360 videos that allow you to explore some of these places in a newly immersive way . “ Travel is a great match for 360 videos because the medium provides a vivid sense of place ” said Maureen Towey the senior producer for 360 News at The New York Times . “ We ask our shooters to be adventurous in their camera placement . When they ask if they can rig the camera to a motorcycle a balloon or a ski lift we say yes every time . ” On a computer you ’ll also notice a stunning drone video shot in Tofino on the western coast of Vancouver Island . “ After many wet days there was one morning the clouds broke and the waves were a bit better ” said Josh Haner a staff photographer who shot the footage . “ As my drone ’s batteries were running out I looked to the right and a beautiful rainbow filled the beach . It was a spectacular 45 minutes . ” And print readers will notice something new as well : a special presentation of the list that can be removed from the section and pored over ( or hung on the wall ) .

" Broadway shows often fold their tents at the end of the year fearing the winter blues at the box office . But this year a few shows of note are holding on at least for a week or two . You ’ve got a few more days to catch Stephen Karam ’s gorgeous “ The Humans ” last season ’s Tony winner for best play ( ending on Jan. 15 ) and even fewer to jump on the exhilarating emotional roller coaster that is the sublime revival of the musical “ Falsettos ” ( ending on Sunday ) . Looking further ahead here are other notable shows and events I ’d put at the top of my list . The first of the majestic cycle of plays written by the great August Wilson this drama set in the 1970 s ( and written in 1979 ) was until now the only piece of the cycle not to be produced on Broadway . A classic Wilson ensemble drama about a group of gypsy cab drivers in the Hill District of Pittsburgh the new Manhattan Theater Club production is directed by Ruben who has both appeared in and directed Wilson ’s plays — notably the superb recent revival of “ The Piano Lesson ” from the Signature Theater . ( In previews for a Jan. 19 opening at the Samuel J. Friedman Theater . ) Normally I frown on theater as a rarefied form of stargazing . But with a star as luminous as Cate Blanchett I will grant an exception . And of course Ms. Blanchett who graces this new adaptation of “ Platonov ” an early Chekhov play is not merely a movie star burnishing her reputation with a Broadway debut . During the past decade she has made regular acclaimed appearances on the New York stage in productions imported from the Sydney Theater Company ( as is this one ) . An unwieldy drama about the familiar Chekhovian concerns — lives full of regret stomachs bloated with vodka — the play has been moved from Russia in the 19th century to Russia in the late 20th century for this version by Andrew Upton Ms. Blanchett ’s husband . The esteemed Australian actor Richard Roxburgh is Platonov . ( In previews for a Sunday opening at the Barrymore Theater . ) I have been saving this lovable classic as a cure for the blues . The small but enterprising Irish Rep first produced this delicious musical whimsy with a glorious
" Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo of New York said on Wednesday that with a complete overhaul of La Guardia Airport underway he wants to rebuild New York City ’s other airport John F. Kennedy International . Mr. Cuomo outlined a plan to spend more than $ 10 billion modernizing Kennedy ’s terminals and improving the highway and transit systems connected to the airport . He did not provide a timetable for the plan or say specifically where all of the money would come from . “ The next step is to tackle J. F. K. because La Guardia isn ’t enough ” Mr. Cuomo said speaking at a meeting of the Association for a Better New York a business group in Manhattan . “ We need to build a new airport at J. F. K. and go through the same process as we did with La Guardia . ” In promoting big infrastructure projects including the Second Avenue subway which opened Sunday Mr. Cuomo is building his legacy in New York and perhaps raising his national profile . The plans offered by Mr. Cuomo on Wednesday suggest that he does not intend to stop trying to impose his will on the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey which operates La Guardia and J. F. K. The authority ’s commissioners are scheduled to meet on Thursday to vote on a $ 30 billion spending plan that includes only about $ 1 billion for improvements at J. F. K. When Mr. Cuomo formed an advisory group in 2015 to study how to improve J. F. K. he said the panel would make recommendations to the authority . But the authority ’s chairman John J. Degnan did not see the panel ’s final report until Tuesday . “ We await an opportunity to review the details of the governor ’s proposal ” Mr. Degnan said on Wednesday . “ We will have to evaluate it against other compelling capital needs identified by the Port Authority both within other airports and within other operations that we oversee . ” Mr. Degnan an appointee of Gov. Chris Christie of New Jersey a Republican has been at odds with Mr. Cuomo a Democrat over the authority ’s spending priorities . The agency also operates the main commuter bus terminal in Manhattan and Newark Liberty International Airport . Mr. Cuomo pushed for $ 2. 5 billion in the capital plan for improvements at the New York airports
" On the morning of May 182014 Violeta Lagunes was perplexed by a series of strange messages that appeared in her Gmail inbox . It was Election Day to choose the leadership of Mexico ’s Partido Acción Nacional or PAN and Lagunes a former federal congresswoman was holding a strategy meeting in her office in Puebla city . The emails seemed harmless at least at first . One appeared to come from the account of a trusted colleague . It asked her to download and review a document . Lagunes clicked on the link but it seemed to be broken so she wrote back to her colleague and asked him to send it again . Elsewhere in her inbox was an email from Google warning her that someone had tried to log in to her account . Meanwhile she began to receive phone calls from PAN allies who claimed that they had received emails from Lagunes ’s account that she did not remember sending . Now Lagunes was worried . Around 1 o’clock she called the colleague who appeared to have emailed her . She reached him at a restaurant where he was finishing lunch with other campaign allies . “ I did not send you an email ” he insisted . A consultant with the campaign — who asked to remain anonymous in order to preserve his relationships with other candidates — overheard the conversation . He knew of other campaign workers who had been receiving similar messages : emails with vague subject lines asking the recipient to review a document or click a link . The campaign he realized had been hacked . In the vote for party leader Lagunes and her allies in Puebla — a drive southeast from Mexico City — were supporting the challenger a senator who promised to return the party to its conservative roots . But the incumbent was backed by Puebla ’s powerful governor Rafael Moreno Valle . One of Mexico ’s rising political stars
" It hasn ’t been a great time to be a man without a job . The jobs that have been disappearing like machine operator are predominantly those that men do . The occupations that are growing like health aide employ mostly women . One solution is for the men who have lost jobs in factories to become health aides . But while more than a fifth of American men aren ’t working they aren ’t running to these new jobs . Why ? They require very different skills and pay a lot less . They ’re also seen as women ’s work which has always been devalued in the American labor market . The two occupations predicted by the Bureau of Labor Statistics to decline most quickly from 2014 to 2024 are locomotive firers shrinking 70 percent and vehicle electronics installers and repairers down 50 percent . They are 96 percent and 98 percent male . Of the jobs many are various types of health aides which are about 90 percent female . When men take these jobs they have more job security and wage growth than in work according to recent research . But they are paid less and feel stigmatized . “ The jobs being created are very different than the jobs being eliminated ” said David Autor an economist at M. I.

I ’m very worried about whether there will be jobs for adults especially the males who seem very reluctant to take the new jobs . ” Take Tracy Dawson 53 a welder in St. Clair
" Apple complying with what it said was a request from Chinese authorities removed news apps created by The New York Times from its app store in China late last month . The move limits access to one of the few remaining channels for readers in mainland China to read The Times without resorting to special software . The government began blocking The Times ’s websites in 2012 after a series of articles on the wealth amassed by the family of Wen Jiabao who was then prime minister but it had struggled in recent months to prevent readers from using the app . Apple removed both the and apps from the app store in China on Dec. 23 . Apps from other international publications including The Financial Times and The Wall Street Journal were still available in the app store . “ For some time now the New York Times app has not been permitted to display content to most users in China and we have been informed that the app is in violation of local regulations ” Fred Sainz an Apple spokesman said of the Times apps . “ As a result the app must be taken down off the China App Store . When this situation changes the App Store will once again offer the New York Times app for download in China . ” Mr. Sainz declined to comment on what local regulations the Times apps were said to have violated who had contacted Apple and when and whether a court order or other legal document had been presented . China ’s main internet regulator the Cyberspace Administration of China did not respond to faxed questions . The Times bureau in Beijing said it had not been contacted by the Chinese government about the matter . A Times spokeswoman in New York Eileen Murphy said the company had asked Apple to reconsider its decision . “ The request by the Chinese authorities to remove our apps is part of their wider attempt to prevent readers in China from accessing independent news coverage by The New York Times of that country coverage which is no different from the journalism we do about every other country in the world ” Ms. Murphy said in a statement . The request appears to have been made under regulations released in June 2016 called Provisions on the Administration of Mobile Internet Application Information Services . The regulations say apps cannot “ engage in activities prohibited by laws and regulations such as endangering national security
" WASHINGTON — Federal Reserve officials expect Donald J. Trump ’s election to result in somewhat faster economic growth over the next several years but they see little chance of the boom Mr. Trump has promised according to an account of the Fed ’s most recent meeting in . That is in part because the Fed plans to raise interest rates more quickly if growth accelerates . For now however Fed officials plan to wait and see what happens next the account said . “ While the Fed signaled that it would likely respond to expansionary fiscal policies with a faster pace of rate hikes the Fed believes it is too early to embed this into its baseline ” Michael Gapen chief United States economist at Barclays wrote on Wednesday following the release of the minutes . “ Any real shift in the stance of monetary policy will require more clarity on the stance of fiscal policy . ” At the December meeting the Fed raised its benchmark rate for just the second time since 2008 citing the continued expansion of the economy and the steady decline of unemployment . The Fed debated and delayed that increase for most of last year but the account published on Wednesday — after a standard delay — described the final decision as uncontroversial . Officials instead spent the meeting talking about what comes next . Mr. Trump has promised a bevy of major changes in economic policy including tax cuts and spending increases reductions in regulation and restrictions on trade and immigration . As a result the account said Fed officials regard both faster growth and slower growth as more likely than before the election when the economy seemed locked into its longstanding pattern of slow and steady growth . “ The job of conducting U. S. monetary policy has not become any easier over recent months ” said James Marple

Instead Mr. Shah who until recently had been the administrator of the United States Agency for International Development ultimately said he wanted to be considered for the post . He got the job . On Thursday the Rockefeller Foundation one of the country ’s largest and most influential philanthropies will name Mr. Shah to succeed Judith Rodin who has been president for 12 years . The appointment will make Mr. Shah one of the most powerful forces in charitable giving overseeing a foundation that donates roughly $ 200 million each year and corrals governments companies and organizations to contribute money and resources in tandem . Mr. Shah 43 will be the first to lead the Rockefeller Foundation which has gained stature in recent years through some prominent projects but has sometimes been criticized as being more interested in its publicity than its grantees . Founded in 1913 by the oil tycoon John D. Rockefeller the foundation says it has given away the equivalent of more than $ 17 billion in today ’s dollars . Its first grant was to the American Red Cross and it went on to play pivotal roles in establishing the field of public health creating vaccines for yellow fever and malaria and bringing agricultural advances to the developing world .

" MANILA — A manhunt was underway Wednesday for more than 150 inmates who escaped from a jail in the southern Philippines after it came under attack by gunmen overnight . One guard was killed and another wounded in the assault on a jail in Kidapawan City on the southern island of Mindanao according to Peter Bungat the warden . The gunmen were thought to be from a bandit group that had broken away from a Muslim rebel organization Mr. Bungat told a radio station on Mindanao which is home to a insurgency . Five of the 158 inmates who escaped from the facility the North Cotabato District Jail were later killed in a shootout with pursuing officers Senior Inspector Xavier Solda a spokesman for the Philippine Bureau of Jail Management and Penology told a radio station in Manila . A village official was also killed when he was mistaken for one of the escaped inmates the police said . Mr. Bungat said the attack began early Wednesday when the jail ’s power supply was cut . Armed men then approached from behind the compound and began firing . “ It was well planned ” Mr. Bungat said . He said it was unclear whether any “ high profile ” inmates were among the escapees . At least a dozen were involved in drug trafficking according to officials from the jail management bureau . Mr. Bungat said the assault was believed to have been led by a bandit known as Commander Derbie who once led a faction of the Moro Islamic Liberation Front the Philippines ’ largest rebel group . Commander Derbie is widely believed to have broken away from that organization which has signed a peace deal with the government . Philippine security officials have said that Commander Derbie joined a breakaway group called the Bangsamoro Islamic Freedom Fighters . A spokesman for that group Abu Misry denied any involvement in the jailbreak . Ernesto Abella a spokesman for President Rodrigo Duterte
" BEIJING — China ’s leaders thought they had a solution to the torrent of snark jibes and condemnation on Twitter : They banned access to it at home . Yet China has become the country that Donald J. Trump seems to enjoy criticizing the most on his Twitter feed . In bursts of 140 characters or less he has jabbed at Beijing over Taiwan trade the South China Sea and most recently North Korea . “ China has been taking out massive amounts of money wealth from the U. S. in totally trade but won ’t help with North Korea . Nice ! ” Mr. Trump said on Twitter on Monday . How and when President Xi Jinping reads about these broadsides remains a mystery to outsiders . Translating Mr. Trump ’s sarcasm — “ Nice ! ” — could be tricky . But Chinese officials and the state news media want Mr. Trump to know that their leaders prefer doing diplomacy the way behind closed doors and muffled in platitudes . Xinhua the state news agency has more or less asked Mr. Trump to shut up . “ An obsession with ‘ Twitter foreign policy ’ is undesirable ” read the headline of a Xinhua commentary on Tuesday about Mr. Trump ’s posts . “ Everyone recognizes the common sense that foreign policy isn ’t child ’s play and even less is it like doing business deals ” said the article published after Mr. Trump ’s latest barbed comments on China . “ Twitter shouldn ’t become an instrument of foreign policy ” the article said . Earlier that day a spokesman for the Ministry of Foreign Affairs rejected Mr. Trump ’s accusation that Beijing had coddled North Korea . But the article acknowledged that it was probably too late to detach Mr. Trump from Twitter . Mr. Trump ’s designated press secretary Sean Spicer has indicated that Mr. Trump will keep using the terse punchy format after he settles in the White House . “ Issuing tweets has become a habit for Mr. Trump
" DORAL Fla . — Inside a clandestine Carnival Corporation complex here two former Disney executives have been plotting a drastic cruise industry overhaul . Their mission : Take lessons learned at Walt Disney World where they helped bring about a $ 1 billion vacation management system involving bracelets that link to personal information and apply them to cruises . The result : Millions of passengers on Carnival ships will soon be using a similar but more advanced system that allows travelers to do everything from plan vacations to open stateroom doors to order poolside cocktails . “ As long as bigger newer cooler ships have kept coming the cruise industry has treated guest liabilities — standing in long lines having a frustrating embarkation experience — as acceptable ” said John Padgett who joined Carnival in 2014 as chief experience and innovation officer after 18 years at Disney . “ That thinking stops now . ” Carnival which operates more than 100 ships worldwide under 10 brands will unveil its ambitious technology initiative on Thursday at the Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas . In a keynote speech Arnold W. Donald Carnival ’s chief executive intends to announce that the system — an app called Ocean Compass paired with a smart medallion that can be carried in a pocket or worn as jewelry — will arrive on the company ’s Princess Cruises fleet this year . Mr. Donald declined in an interview to give a timeline for bringing the technology ( code name : Trident ) to other Carnival brands . But he emphasized that rolling out the personalized disks and app was a companywide priority . “ The cost is in the hundreds of millions of dollars and over time more than that ” Mr. Donald said . “ People want the world to be organized around them . On vacation even more so . ” Analysts expect the technology to increase profits in multiple ways
" The nation ’s consumer watchdog agency on Tuesday ordered the agencies TransUnion and Equifax to pay more than $ 23 . 2 million in fines and restitution for deceiving customers about the usefulness of credit scores and the cost of obtaining them . The watchdog agency the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau said the payments would resolve charges that TransUnion and Equifax had lured consumers into enrolling in credit services advertised as free or costing only $ 1 but which could cost more than $ 200 a year . TransUnion will reimburse $ 13 . 93 million to consumers and pay a $ 3 million civil fine while Equifax will reimburse $ 3. 8 million and pay a $ 2. 5 million civil fine the bureau said . Both companies will also modify their marketing practices . Among the changes they will obtain customers ’ consent to enroll them in services in which fees begin after free trials and make it easier for them to cancel services they do not want . The bureau said the wrongful conduct had violated the law and had occurred at TransUnion since July 2011 and at Equifax between July 2011 and March 2014 . Many lenders rely on credit scores from TransUnion Equifax and their rival Experian when lending money . But TransUnion and Equifax falsely represented the credit scores they sold to consumers as being the same scores that lenders used the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau said . “ Credit scores are central to a consumer ’s financial life and people deserve honest and accurate information about them ” Richard Cordray the bureau ’s director said in a statement . Neither TransUnion which is based in Chicago nor Equifax which is based in Atlanta admitted or denied wrongdoing . A TransUnion spokesman David Blumberg and an Equifax spokeswoman Ines Gutzmer said their companies believed that they had complied with the law and were committed to better educating consumers about their credit .

2017.01.0"LONDON — Maybe it wasn ’t just the iceberg . Ever since the Titanic sank more than 104 years ago killing more than 1500 men women and children mystery has swirled around the tragedy . No one doubts that the ship collided at high speed with an iceberg off the coast of Newfoundland . But a new documentary posits that the sinking of the ship — hailed at the time as the largest ever built and praised for its professed unsinkability — may have been accelerated by a giant coal fire in its hull that appeared to have started as long as three weeks before it set off on its fateful journey to New York from Southampton England . In the documentary which was broadcast on Channel 4 in Britain on New Year ’s Day Senan Molony an Irish journalist who has spent more than 30 years researching the Titanic contends that the fire in a bunker next to one of the ship ’s boiler rooms damaged its hull helping to seal its fate long before it slammed into the iceberg . “ It ’s a perfect storm of extraordinary factors coming together : fire ice and criminal negligence ” he argues in the documentary “ Titanic : The New Evidence ” which will air in the United States on the Smithsonian Channel on January 21 . “ The fire was known about
" When a Wall Street banking institution starts throwing bonuses at credit card customers it may be best to grab them before they inevitably disappear . And so it goes with Chase Sapphire Reserve a card that the bank JPMorgan Chase introduced last summer . The bank offered a bonus worth $ 1 500 to people who spent $ 4 000 on the card in the first three months they had it and then redeemed the bonus for travel . Now the bank is cutting the bonus in half . Jan. 12 will be the last day that people can earn it by applying for the card online though people who apply at a bank branch will still be able to get the bonus until March 12 . You need not be a current bank customer to apply at a branch according to a bank spokeswoman Ashley E. Dodd who confirmed the changes . The bonus played a big role in bringing the card so much attention landing it on the cover of Bloomberg Businessweek and leading the bank to hand out so many perks that it caused a $ 200 million to $ 300 million hit to its earnings . Even without the outsize bonus which was very rare in the history of credit card bonus offers the card is likely to remain popular . While it has a steep $ 450 annual fee cardholders receive a $ 300 credit each year for any travel spending they put on the card . And customers earn three points for every dollar they spend on all travel and dining which can lead to better value than the rewards that most other cards offer for customers who spent a lot in those areas . The Points Guy blog first reported the slashing of the bonus . Many such sites now exist to help consumers take advantage of the most lucrative offers while collecting commissions when they pass readers on to card issuers ’ application sites . If those customers keep the cards for a few years ( and especially if they run up balances and pay interest ) the banks can come out ahead . With too many people gaming the offer however bank profitability can suffer especially when the bonuses are so large that they attract hordes of consumers . "
" Broadway rang out 2016 with a very big bang . The 33 plays and musicals running last week brought in a whopping $ 49 . 7 million making it the week in Broadway history . It was also the week on record with 359495 people seeing Broadway shows . All around Times Square records were toppled like pins in a bowling alley : It was the best week ever for shows like “ Chicago ” “ Jersey Boys ” and “ The Lion King ” the most money ever grossed at multiple theaters built more than a century ago ( for example $ 911 000 by “ Oh Hello ” at the Lyceum which was built in 1903 ) the most performances ever by a single show during a period ( 17 by “ The Illusionists ” ) and the most money ever grossed by a single show ( $ 3. 3 million by “ Hamilton ” ) . An astonishing 24 shows grossed more than $ 1 million last week including seven that grossed more than $ 2 million according to figures released Tuesday by the Broadway League . Three shows topped the $ 3 million mark : “ Hamilton ” “ Wicked ” and “ The Lion King . ” The grosses for the week ending Jan. 1 were 63 percent higher than the previous week and 15 percent higher than the same week the previous year ( even though there were five more shows playing at the same time last year ) . Why ? The most significant factor appears to be pricing : The base prices for many Broadway shows are high and the premium prices charged over the holiday period were even higher . shows had an average price over $ 100 . And for “ Hamilton ” now the industry leader in pricing the average price was $ 310 and the top price was $ 998 . ( That ’s the price charged by the box office the first time a ticket was sold many people paid higher prices purchasing from resellers . ) There were other factors contributing to the Broadway bonanza . New York City was wrapping up a banner year for tourism : an estimated 60 . 3 million visitors up from 58 . 5 million the previous year
" LECCE Italy — One of his first students was a young man he had arrested four years earlier . Others have been convicted of armed robbery drug trafficking and criminal association with the mafia . The classrooms are frugally equipped behind windows protected by vertical and horizontal bars although one has brightly colored paintings covering the walls . But none of that deterred Marco Albanese a police officer for 19 years and a trained sommelier for five from teaching a class of rapt students the finer points of deconstructing the bouquet of a chardonnay or pouring a rare vintage . Mr. Albanese 43 is an instructor in an innovative effort at Lecce Penitentiary to teach inmates to be sommeliers or wine stewards . The courses are part of a program to teach prisoners new professional skills as well as to help them develop a bond with the region which is renowned for its negroamaro grapes . The program has been enthusiastically embraced by the prisoner students who were tasting white wines on a recent afternoon . It has also been an eye opener for Mr. Albanese . “ I could see their human aspect once they were out of their context ” Mr. Albanese who traded in his police uniform for the crisp blue jacket and tie of a sommelier for the class . “ And I didn ’t have to keep the same distance now that I was their ‘ professor . ’ ” He added “ They also deserve a second chance and it ’s important that they know that the institutions do believe that they can be educated to a different life . ” In eight lessons the group of 30 men and women
" In the first episode of “ One Day at a Time ” Netflix ’s reboot of the Norman Lear sitcom Penelope ( Justina Machado ) has an argument with her son Alex ( Marcel Ruiz ) who wants an expensive new pair of sneakers . “ Mom ” he says “ I know we ’re not rich . But are we poor ? ” It ’s a casual line that sets up a joke . ( Penelope reminds Alex that they have a TV a refrigerator and a laptop . “ Those are things poor people have ! ” he says . ) But it ’s based on an acknowledgment you don ’t really hear in prime time anymore : that there is a class divide nebulous but real and that your family is closer to the bad side of it . The new “ One Day at a Time ” arriving on Friday is lively and full of voice a rare reboot that ’s better than the original . It ’s a throwback in the best sense to an era of mainstream socially engaged sitcoms . And just as the political debate has pitted diversity against class in a contest it ’s a reminder that the two aren ’t mutually exclusive . In the 1970 s TV was full of characters living paycheck to paycheck whether cabbies ( “ Taxi ” ) waitresses ( “ Alice ” ) auto mechanics ( “ Chico and the Man ” ) or brewery workers ( “ Laverne and Shirley ” ) .

" Your forthcoming book “ Tears We Cannot Stop ” is subtitled “ A Sermon to White America . ” Which part of white America do you envision reading it ? I envision the audience to be that ocean of white folk I encounter who are deeply empathetic to the struggles of minorities — they are the ones who ask me “ What can I do as a white person ? ” This is my attempt to address them in the most useful and hopefully edifying manner . What ’s your strategy for getting through to the white people who may not be particularly sympathetic ? What I ’ve seen under the wonderful presidency of Barack Obama is the tendency to not tell white people the truth for obvious reasons — they don ’t vote for you . But I ’m not a politician . I don ’t have that power or influence but what I do wield is a different kind of bully pulpit . We have to have enough belief in white people to tell them the truth . They are grown ! There are a lot of areas within race relations that seem like less of a conversation and more of an attempt to prove to white people that these issues — police brutality for instance — are a real and present danger . I open this book with horror stories about my engagement with the police . These are the stories that have shaped me that join me to the mass of people who regardless of our station in life regardless of educational attainment and achievement have felt this . The president of the United States has these stories the former attorney general has these stories and a prominent black intellectual like me has these stories . The reality is that this is part and parcel of what it means to be black in America and I wanted to spend time talking and thinking about it from a number of different perspectives to show white brothers and sisters that we aren ’t making this up . This is not fabricated . I can ’t help but think that if the same levels of police brutality were happening to white people we would just disband the police . Police brutality would not be seen as the price of keeping our society safe . Recently I was outside of Ben ’s Chili Bowl in Washington at 3 a. m. and a young white kid is cursing the police and I ’m going “ Oh my God

" WASHINGTON — A united front of top intelligence officials and senators from both parties on Thursday forcefully reaffirmed the conclusion that the Russian government used hacking and leaks to try to influence the presidential election directly rebuffing Donald J. Trump ’s repeated questioning of Russia ’s role . They suggested that the doubts Mr. Trump has expressed on Twitter about the agencies ’ competence and impartiality were undermining their morale . “ There ’s a difference between skepticism and disparagement ” James R. Clapper Jr . the director of national intelligence said at a hearing of the Senate Armed Services Committee on the Russian hacks . He added that “ our assessment now is even more resolute ” that the Russians carried out the attack on the election . The Senate hearing was the prelude to an extraordinary meeting scheduled for Friday when Mr. Clapper and other intelligence chiefs will repeat for Mr. Trump the same detailed highly classified briefing on the Russian attack that President Obama received on Thursday . In effect they will be telling the that the spy agencies believe he won with an assist from President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia . Then Mr. Trump will have to say whether he accepts the agencies ’ basic findings on Russia ’s role or holds to his previous contention that inept politicized American spies have gotten the perpetrator of the hacking wrong . That would throw the intelligence agencies into a crisis of credibility and status with few if any precedents . In a pair of Twitter posts early Thursday Mr. Trump appeared to back away from the scorn he had previously expressed for the intelligence agencies ’ work as well as from his embrace of Julian Assange the founder of WikiLeaks which released most of the hacked emails of Democratic officials . “ The dishonest media likes saying that I am in agreement with Julian Assange — wrong ” he wrote . “ I simply state what he states it is for the people to make up their own minds as to the truth . The media lies to make it look like I am against ‘ Intelligence ’ when in fact I am a big fan ! ” But on Thursday night the returned to Twitter and appeared to underscore his doubts about the F. B. I. ’s investigation of the hacking . “ The Democratic National Committee would not allow the FBI to study or see its computer info after it was supposedly hacked by Russia ” he wrote a day after a report by BuzzFeed on the issue . “ So how and why are they so sure about hacking if they never even requested an examination of the computer servers ? What is going on ? ” Early next week the public will get its fullest information to date on the evidence the agencies have to support their contention that Mr. Putin ’s government used the hacked emails to hurt Hillary Clinton ’s campaign and help Mr. Trump’s . Mr. Clapper said he would “ push the envelope ” to include as much detail as possible in the unclassified version of the intelligence agencies ’ report on the Russian operation . The hacking
" WASHINGTON — Donald J. Trump is expected to choose as director of national intelligence Senator Dan Coats a former ambassador to Germany secret foodie and lover of all things Indiana who also served as a member of his chamber ’s Intelligence Committee . Known for a style Mr. Coats was popular among his colleagues . “ I always thought he should wear a red cardigan ” said Senator Cory Gardner Republican of Colorado . “ He was the closest thing to Mister Rogers we could come up with . ” While fiscally conservative Mr. Coats an Indiana Republican who completed his second Senate stint this month often found common cause with Democrats who described him as thoughtful on intelligence and national security issues with a sharp intellect and disarming humor . “ I have always been impressed with his demeanor ” said Senator Angus King a Maine independent who caucuses with the Democrats and who served on the Intelligence Committee with Mr. Coats and traveled with him in Eastern Europe . “ He ’s not a fierce partisan and knows the intelligence community . He ’s very amiable and easy to work with . ” The position of America ’s top intelligence official was created by Congress in 2004 as a response to criticism that the nation ’s spy agencies had failed to detect and prevent the terrorist attacks on Sept. 112001 . Since then the director has been charged with coordinating the and analysis of the country ’s 16 civilian and military spy agencies helping to prevent a terrorist attack and serving as a central liaison to presidents and their White House staff . But bureaucratic turf wars have dogged the office of the director of national intelligence since its creation . Officials who run the C. I. A. and the Defense Intelligence Agency among others have sought to maintain control over parts of the spying apparatus
" WASHINGTON — When Special Agent Adrian Hawkins of the Federal Bureau of Investigation called the Democratic National Committee in September 2015 to pass along some troubling news about its computer network he was transferred naturally to the help desk . His message was brief if alarming . At least one computer system belonging to the D. N. C. had been compromised by hackers federal investigators had named “ the Dukes ” a cyberespionage team linked to the Russian government . The F. B. I. knew it well : The bureau had spent the last few years trying to kick the Dukes out of the unclassified email systems of the White House the State Department and even the Joint Chiefs of Staff one of the government ’s networks . Yared Tamene the contractor at the D. N. C. who fielded the call was no expert in cyberattacks . His first moves were to check Google for “ the Dukes ” and conduct a cursory search of the D. N. C. computer system logs to look for hints of such a cyberintrusion . By his own account he did not look too hard even after Special Agent Hawkins called back repeatedly over the next several weeks — in part because he wasn ’t certain the caller was a real F. B. I. agent and not an impostor . “ I had no way of differentiating the call I just received from a prank call ” Mr. Tamene wrote in an internal memo obtained by The New York Times that detailed his contact with the F. B. I. It was the cryptic first sign of a cyberespionage and campaign devised to disrupt the 2016 presidential election the first such attempt by a foreign power in American history . What started as an operation intelligence officials believe ultimately morphed into an effort to harm one candidate Hillary Clinton and tip the election to her opponent Donald J. Trump . Like another famous American election scandal
" When the United Nations ’ top official tried to inspect an infamous prison in Gambia two years ago officials there denied him access . So he protested all the way up the country ’s chain of command . In a tense meeting with members of the cabinet of the country ’s autocratic ruler the United Nations official Juan E. Méndez was again denied this time with a jeering dismissal . “ They said ‘ Why don ’t you go to Guantánamo instead ’ ” recalled Mr. Mendez a former United Nations special rapporteur on torture . In Bahrain officials were a little more subtle but the message was the same as they twice canceled prison inspection visits . “ They said we face the same threats to national security as other countries face ” Mr. Mendez said . “ It was clear they were referring to the United States and they didn ’t feel that they needed to give me access . ” Now after Donald J. Trump ’s campaign vows to reinstate the sort of torture used in the war on terrorism — and to fill the Guantánamo Bay prison with “ some bad dudes ” — human rights experts fear that authoritarian regimes around the world will see it as another green light to carry out their own abuses . A return to such “ enhanced interrogation ” — and even to techniques that Mr. Trump has pledged will be “ much worse ” — would also send a powerful message just as nations around the world have begun to examine their own past abuses to ensure that they will not be repeated . “ Sometimes we see progress and then we see ” said Victor the of the International Rehabilitation Council for Torture Victims a umbrella organization for groups . “ When the U. S. was engaging in torture that created an enormous of the pendulum ” he added . “ There were a lot of officials in other countries during the Bush administration who were saying ‘ The Americans are doing it so why can ’t we ? ’ Now
" WASHINGTON — Vice Mike Pence and the top Republicans in Congress made clear on Wednesday more powerfully and explicitly than ever that they are dead serious about repealing the Affordable Care Act . How they can uproot a law deeply embedded in the nation ’s health care system without hurting some of the 20 million people who have gained coverage through it is not clear . Nor is it yet evident that millions of Americans with medical conditions will be fully protected against disruptions in their health coverage . But a determined Republican president and Congress can gut the Affordable Care Act and do it quickly : a health care revolution in reverse that would undo many of the changes made since the law was signed by President Obama in March 2010 . The Senate intends to pass a budget resolution next week that would shield repeal legislation from a Democratic filibuster . If the Senate completes its action House Republican leaders hope that they too can approve a version of the budget resolution next week . Whether they can meet that goal is unclear . The resolution contains seemingly innocuous language instructing four committees that control health care policy — two in the Senate two in the House — to draft legislation within their jurisdiction that would cut at least $ 1 billion from the deficit over 10 years . But that language has real teeth . The legislation produced to meet those instructions can pass the Senate with a simple majority — 51 votes if all senators are present — obliterating the power of the Democratic minority to block it . Those four committees would have just a few weeks until Jan. 27 to produce legislation repealing major provisions of the Affordable Care Act . House Republicans have some practice at this because they have voted more than 60 times since 2011 to repeal some or all of the law . The budget blueprint will guide Congress but will not be presented to the president for a signature or veto . The committees — House Energy and Commerce House Ways and Means Senate Finance and Senate Health Education Labor and Pensions — will quickly assemble legislation intended to eviscerate the health care law . The repeal legislation will be in the form of a reconciliation bill authorized by the Congressional Budget Act of 1974 . Such bills can be adopted under special procedures . But Senate rules generally bar the use of those procedures for measures that have no effect on spending or revenue . So the legislation as now conceived would probably leave the most popular provisions of the health law intact such as the prohibition on insurers ’ denying coverage to people with conditions . Instead
" WASHINGTON — Donald J. Trump ’s transition staff has issued a blanket edict requiring politically appointed ambassadors to leave their overseas posts by Inauguration Day according to several American diplomats familiar with the plan breaking with decades of precedent by declining to provide even the briefest of grace periods . The mandate — issued “ without exceptions ” according to a terse State Department cable sent on Dec. 23 diplomats who saw it said — threatens to leave the United States without envoys for months in critical nations like Germany Canada and Britain . In the past administrations of both parties have often granted extensions on a basis to allow a handful of ambassadors particularly those with children to remain in place for weeks or months . Mr. Trump by contrast has taken a hard line against leaving any of President Obama ’s political appointees in place as he prepares to take office on Jan. 20 with a mission of dismantling many of his predecessor ’s signature foreign and domestic policy achievements . “ Political ” ambassadors many of them major donors who are nominated by virtue of close ties with the president almost always leave at the end of his term ambassadors who are career diplomats often remain in their posts . A senior Trump transition official said there was no ill will in the move describing it as a simple matter of ensuring that Mr. Obama ’s overseas appointees leave the government on schedule just as thousands of political aides at the White House and in federal agencies must do . The official who spoke on the condition of anonymity about internal deliberations said the ambassadors should not be surprised about being held to a hard end date . The directive has nonetheless upended the personal lives of many ambassadors who are scrambling to secure living arrangements and acquire visas allowing them to remain in their countries so their children can remain in school the diplomats said . They spoke on the condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to comment publicly on the matter . In Costa Rica Ambassador Stafford Fitzgerald Haney is hunting for a house or an apartment as his family — which includes four children and his wife
" WASHINGTON — Donald J. Trump lashed out at Democrats on Thursday over their efforts to preserve President Obama ’s health care coverage law insulting their top legislative leader and denouncing the measure as a “ lie ” as he called for a less expensive and more effective system . “ The Democrats lead by head clown Chuck Schumer know how bad ObamaCare is and what a mess they are in ” Mr. Trump wrote in the first of three posts on Twitter . The posts arrived the day after Mr. Obama huddled with Democrats on Capitol Hill to strategize over protecting the Affordable Care Act and Vice Mike Pence met with Republicans about how to gut it . “ Instead of working to fix it they do the typical political thing and BLAME ” Mr. Trump continued on Twitter . “ The fact is ObamaCare was a lie from the beginning . ‘ Keep you doctor keep your plan ! ’ ” He said it was time for Republicans and Democrats to work together on a “ plan that really works — much less expensive FAR BETTER ! ” The messages could be seen as Mr. Trump ’s latest attempt to seize the narrative of the day and deflect attention from a story line less favorable to him . Senate Republicans convened a hearing on Thursday to examine intelligence that the Russians engaged in computer hacking to affect the outcome of the presidential campaign . Mr. Trump has disputed that the Russians were to blame and he has criticized American intelligence agencies for their work . Mr. Trump also used the social media platform to push back against criticism he attracted on Wednesday for siding with Julian Assange the WikiLeaks founder over United States intelligence officials in rejecting Russian responsibility for the hacking . Mr. Trump ’s latest Twitter salvo also appeared to be an attempt to mount a political defense of his bid to scrap the law that has provided health care coverage to tens of millions of Americans as Democrats work to make that effort politically toxic . Mr. Schumer responded later Thursday saying the was in a “ difficult spot ” on the issue . “ Instead of calling names ” Mr. Schumer said at a news conference on Capitol Hill Mr. Trump “ should roll up his sleeves and show us a replacement plan that will cover the 20 million Americans who gained coverage that will cover students or students 21 to 26 who want to stay on their parents ’ plan that will show how we cover people with conditions . ” On Wednesday the appeared to acknowledge the challenges of doing so without being saddled by voters with a share of blame for the shortcomings of the measure . “ Republicans must be careful in that the Dems own the failed ObamaCare disaster with its poor coverage and massive premium increases
" TALLADEGA Ala . — For a band at a tiny historically black college it seems in some ways to be the gig of a lifetime : a chance to march and perform at the Jan. 20 presidential inaugural parade in Washington . Some of the musicians at Talladega College have been excited to see the capital for the first time . But because the is Donald J. Trump the school has become the subject of an impassioned national outcry with online petitions threats to end donations and a flurry of from alumni who feel that performing in the parade would betray the values of an institution founded by newly freed slaves 150 years ago . On Thursday after days of speculation that the college administration might bow to the pressure and remove the band from the parade roster the president of Talladega College Billy Hawkins issued a statement confirming the participation of the band the Marching Tornadoes and argued in essence that the 58th presidential inauguration is about something bigger than Mr. Trump . “ We respect and appreciate how our students and alumni feel about our participation in this parade ” Dr. Hawkins said . “ As many of those who chose to participate in the parade have said we feel the inauguration of a new president is not a political event but a civil ceremony celebrating the transfer of power . ” Similar issues have been raised about other entertainers scheduled to perform among them the Radio City Rockettes and the Mormon Tabernacle Choir . But because of Talladega ’s history the issues have been especially intense here with calls for the college to reverse its decision to take part in the festivities . And beyond Talladega
" After more than five years of investigations and negotiations the curious case of MF Global is finally closed . On Thursday federal regulators announced a $ 5 million settlement with Jon S. Corzine who ran MF Global when it collapsed into bankruptcy in 2011 and lost more than $ 1 billion in customer money . The settlement reached unanimously at the Commodity Futures Trading Commission in the waning days of the Obama administration and approved by a federal judge this week caps a spectacle that derailed Mr. Corzine ’s career and spurred a number of congressional criminal and regulatory investigations . The regulatory case arose in 2013 when the commodities agency sued Mr. Corzine a Democratic former New Jersey senator and governor saying he had failed to “ diligently supervise ” the firm as it jeopardized the clients ’ accounts . The agency did not directly link Mr. Corzine 70 to the missing money but it did accuse a employee in Chicago Edith O’Brien of “ aiding and abetting ” the misuse of customer money saying she allowed it to be used to plug holes in MF Global ’s own accounts . To resolve the case Mr. Corzine has agreed to pay the $ 5 million penalty out of his own pocket . While the sum is manageable for someone who reaped many millions of dollars as a top Goldman Sachs executive before pursuing a career in politics it is an unusual step . In other federal cases involving Wall Street insurance money often covers settlement amounts sparing the executives themselves . While Mr. Corzine was willing to settle the case Ms. O’Brien nearly took it to trial . But in recent weeks she
" The question from the analyst on Thursday was delicate enough . In agreeing to buy the Craftsman tool brand from Sears Holdings how would Stanley Black Decker protect itself from legal issues that could arise at the seller down the line ? But the response from Stanley Black Decker ’s chief executive James M. Loree acknowledged a concern that many on the conference call were likely to have harbored : that Sears could be forced to file for bankruptcy protection someday . “ We expect to get this approved before there is any indication whatsoever that there would be any restructuring of that nature from Sears ” Mr. Loree said adding that he believed such a move was not imminent . The sale of Craftsman valued at more than $ 775 million was meant to prevent that day of reckoning by raising cash for Sears . For Sears selling one of its classic brands — one it created nearly a century ago — is the latest move to bolster its balance sheet during a prolonged sales slump . Edward S. Lampert the chairman and chief executive of Sears has struggled for years to find ways to help the company as much through esoteric financial maneuvers as through operational fixes . These have been tough times for retailers . Macy ’s and Kohl ’s said this week that their holiday sales were weaker than expected . Macy ’s also announced plans to cut more than 10000 jobs and close 100 stores . Sears also suffered during the season with sales at its Sears and Kmart units down at least 12 percent . Sears has been in trouble far longer . Under Mr. Lampert who is also a hedge fund manager Sears has consistently lagged behind its peers as analysts said pointing to underinvestment in stores and slumping sales . Last September analysts at Moody ’s estimated that the company ’s negative cash flow for its 2016 fiscal year would be $ 1. 5 billion . As of Oct. 29 Sears had $ 258 million in cash and equivalents on hand compared with $ 3. 1 billion in debt
" A Long Island Rail Road train that crashed in Brooklyn on Wednesday was going more than twice the speed limit when it slammed into a train station injuring more than 100 people federal investigators said on Thursday . The train was traveling at more than 10 miles per hour when it hit the end of the tracks at Atlantic Terminal where the speed limit is 5 m. p. h. said Ted Turpin an investigator for the National Transportation Safety Board . He said that federal officials were investigating the crash and had not yet determined the cause . The train rammed into a bumping block during the morning rush striking a room beyond the track and causing the first two cars to derail . The accident was reminiscent of a deadly crash in September in which a New Jersey Transit train plowed into Hoboken Terminal killing a woman and injuring over 100 people . ( That train was also traveling over twice the speed limit there when it crashed . ) On Thursday Mr. Turpin said the engineer who was operating the Long Island Rail Road train told investigators he could not remember the crash . “ He does recall entering into the station and controlling the speed of the train ” Mr. Turpin said at a news conference . “ But then the next thing he realized was after the collision . ” Investigators have not released the engineer ’s name but Mr. Turpin said that he was 50 and had started as an engineer at the railroad in 1999 . The engineer had started working around midnight on Tuesday and was nearing the end of his shift at the time of the crash Mr. Turpin said . In the Hoboken crash the engineer Thomas Gallagher also said he did not remember the crash . His lawyer later said that Mr. Gallagher had an undiagnosed sleep disorder and discovered after the crash that he had severe sleep apnea which disrupts sleep and may cause excessive daytime sleepiness . The engineer of the Long Island Rail Road train has been tested for drugs but the results were not available federal investigators said on Thursday . The engineer told investigators that he was not using his cellphone at the time of the crash . Federal investigators said they planned on Friday to interview a conductor and an assistant conductor who were also on the train . They also intend to interview two railroad employees who witnessed the crash . Mr. Turpin noted that a safety technology known as positive train control was not in place on the tracks where the crash happened even though it was possible that the technology could have slowed the train . Officials from the safety board have long called for railroads to install the system to help prevent train accidents
" DETROIT — Unexpectedly strong sales of new vehicles in the United States in December propelled the industry to another record figure in 2016 : 17 . 55 million sold . That is the good news . The bad news though is that the late push to beat the previous record 17 . 47 million vehicles sold in 2015 came at a steep cost as companies piled on higher sales incentives to lure consumers to their showrooms . And with the American market tilting more than ever toward sales of pickup trucks and sport utility vehicles companies are cutting production of passenger cars to reduce big inventories of models . As a result there is little expectation that the sales will continue on this upward trajectory — at least not without cutting deep into profits . That means the numbers released Wednesday could be the mark for the industry ’s impressive comeback from the depths of the recession when annual sales fell below 11 million vehicles and General Motors and Chrysler needed government bailouts to survive . Adding to the challenge is the potential for major changes in federal regulatory and trade policies by the Trump administration setting up an uncertain year for an industry that has been barreling along . “ One of the problems with predicting 2017 is it is the year of unknowns ” said Michelle Krebs an analyst with the site Autotrader . “ We are hearing a lot of different things about border tariffs and regulatory policies but we don ’t know what the whole picture looks like . ” Most major automakers are making big profits these days as consumers replace aging cars and trucks with new models loaded with technology that last year sold for an average sticker price above $ 35 000 . Yet companies face a new set of challenges posed by slower growth and industry executives are bracing for potential tariffs on vehicles imported into the United States from Mexico or other adjustments in trade policies that could upset the global pipeline of parts to vehicle assembly plants . The uncertainty extends to the market itself which has steadily grown year after year as consumers took advantage of easy credit and better economic conditions to replace aging vehicles . Demand however

Lundgren the company ’s chairman and chief executive said in a statement that while the trend was “ consistent with the lower end of our guidance we had anticipated sales would be stronger . ” He attributed the decline to “ broader challenges ” facing much of the retail industry . Consumers who endured a long recession have turned to chains like T. J. Maxx and shifted their spending away from stores for the convenience of online shopping with the retail giant Amazon . The announcement on Wednesday continued a trend for Macy ’s which announced last January that it was eliminating about 4500 jobs in a major restructuring . Then too it said slumping holiday season sales had hurt its bottom line . The company which now has 730 stores announced in August that it would close 100 of them . On Wednesday it identified 68 stores to be closed . The store in the Douglaston neighborhood of Queens which opened in 1981 will close . Stores at the Marketplace Mall in Rochester at the Oakdale Mall in Johnson City N. Y. near Binghamton and at the Preakness Shopping Center in Wayne
" So the sparkly dresses and heat tech have been worn the ball and the other shoe has dropped . The year 2016 is over and 2017 has begun . It ’s no longer time to look back but to look forward . And what do we see ? When it comes to fashion — or more important fashion as it affects life — there will be interesting times ahead . Here are some opening thoughts on what to watch for in the coming months . A new look in Washington and Paris . Pantsuits — at least on women — are out . So are the look and the look of men in shirt sleeves . In Washington we are entering the era of the boxy oversize suit the big knot the tie and maybe European brands . As the Trump administration prepares to move into the executive wing fashion — and the American capital — are preparing for a whole new style statement . The inauguration this month will throw down the gauntlet . What the will wear ( Brioni is my best guess ) may ultimately be less significant than what his wife and eldest daughter will wear . Judging by the designs that Melania and Ivanka Trump wore on the campaign trail and on New Year ’s Eve the age of American designers in the White House may be over .

" Everyone has theories for why professionals are moving back into parts of cities shunned by their parents ’ generation . Perhaps their living preferences have shifted . Or the demands of the labor market have and young adults with less leisure time are loath to waste it commuting . Maybe the tendency to postpone marriage and children has made city living more alluring . Or the benefits of cities themselves have improved . “ There are all sorts of potential other amenities whether it ’s cafes restaurants bars nicer parks better schools ” said Ingrid Gould Ellen a professor of urban policy and planning at New York University . “ But a huge piece of it ” she said “ I think is crime . ” New research that she has conducted alongside Keren Mertens Horn an economist at the University of Massachusetts in Boston and Davin Reed a doctoral student at N. Y. U. finds that when violent crime falls sharply wealthier and educated people are more likely to move into and predominantly minority urban neighborhoods . Their working paper suggests that just as rising crime can drive people out of cities falling crime has a comparable effect spurring gentrification . And it highlights how even if many Americans — including by his own words Donald Trump — inaccurately believe urban violence is soaring the opposite trend has brought change to cities . “ We ’re trying to help people understand what a dramatic difference the reduction in violent crime in particular has made in our environment
" NICE France — At times it was hard to know who was on trial the smuggler or the state . The defendant Cédric Herrou 37 a slightly built olive farmer did not deny that for months he had illegally spirited dozens of migrants through the remote mountain valley where he lives . He would do it again he suggested . Instead when asked by a judge “ Why do you do all this ? ” Mr. Herrou turned the tables and questioned the humanity of France ’s practice of rounding up and turning back Africans entering illegally from Italy in search of work and a better life . It was “ ignoble ” he said . “ There are people dying on the side of the road ” Mr. Herrou replied . “ It ’s not right . There are children who are not safe . It is enraging to see children at 2 in the morning completely dehydrated . “ I am a Frenchman ” Mr. Herrou declared . The trial which began on Wednesday is no ordinary one . It has been substantially covered by the French news media for its rich symbolism and for the way it neatly sums up the ambiguity of France ’s policy toward the unceasing flow of migrants into Europe and the quandary they present . France foremost among European nations prides itself on enlightened humanitarianism fraternity and solidarity . And yet perhaps first among them
" As it happens Donald J. Trump is not the only person to announce plans to shut down a personal philanthropy just the best known . This is the story of a man who made and kept that same promise . Nearly five years ago Charles F. Feeney sat in a cushy armchair in an apartment on the east side of Manhattan grandchildren ’s artwork taped to the walls and said that by the end of 2016 he was going to hand out the last of a great fortune that he had made . It was a race : Mr. Feeney was then 81 and Atlantic Philanthropies a collection of private foundations he had started and funded still had about $ 1. 5 billion left . Flinging money out the window or writing checks was not Mr. Feeney ’s way . Last month Mr. Feeney and Atlantic completed the sprint and made a final grant $ 7 million to Cornell University to support students doing community service work . He had officially emptied his pockets meeting his aspiration of “ giving while living . ” Altogether he had contributed $ 8 billion to his philanthropies which have supported higher education public health human rights and scientific research . “ You ’re always nervous handling so much money but we seem to have worked it pretty well ” Mr. Feeney now 85
" SAN FRANCISCO — The virtual currency Bitcoin has been swept up in yet another speculative frenzy pushing its price toward the peak it last reached in late 2013 . The price of Bitcoin has been buoyed by increased interest from places like Venezuela where the local currency has lost much of its value and India where the government recently removed the largest cash notes from circulation . More broadly a tilt toward isolationism that has emerged in American and European politics — highlighted by Donald J. Trump ’s election victory — has given a new sheen to a currency that can move between countries with little oversight . “ The more there is an expectation for new barriers to be erected the more there is an expectation that Bitcoin will be valuable for moving money across borders ” said Gil Luria the director of research at Wedbush Securities . Still most of the people actually buying and selling Bitcoin these days are coming from a single country : China . Some wealthy Chinese have used Bitcoin to evade their government ’s strict controls on moving money in and out of the country according to Bitcoin specialists in China . But the heavy trading on Chinese Bitcoin exchanges much of it by automated software suggests that most of the price movement is a result of bets by speculators . In recent days the price of a Bitcoin has been about 3 percent higher on these exchanges than on dollar denominated exchanges suggesting more demand in China than outside . The importance of speculators suggests that the value of Bitcoin is still driven by the hope of how it might be used someday rather than real world use today which has generally been hard to quantify . In dollar terms a Bitcoin was going for about $ 1 025 on Tuesday or about 140 percent more than what it cost at the beginning of 2016 . The volatile price has led many analysts to conclude that is less similar to a currency than to a commodity
" CHICAGO — The police here were questioning four people on Wednesday as video circulated online showing a white teenager tied up and beaten as a group of young shouted antiwhite messages and insulted Donald J. Trump . “ It ’s sickening ” Superintendent Eddie Johnson of the Chicago Police Department said . “ It makes you wonder what would make individuals treat somebody like that ? ” The police said the victim was an man from suburban Chicago who had “ mental health challenges ” and who had been reported missing . Officers spotted him on Tuesday in a violent neighborhood on Chicago ’s West Side and recognized that he was in distress the police said . They sought treatment for him at a hospital and connected the beating to four people who were taken into custody later that day near where the bloodied man had been found . A roughly video clip shared widely online appeared to show a Facebook livestream of the assault . A group can be seen taunting and physically assaulting a man amid cursing and laughing . Much of the video focuses on one woman as she rambles at times incoherently . The video begins with a shot of that woman before turning to the victim who is seated in the corner of a room with his mouth covered . The woman laughs as two men cut the sleeve of the victim ’s shirt . One of the men yells epithets about Mr. Trump and “ white people . ” Later a man cuts a patch of hair from the victim ’s head appearing to draw blood in the process . Mr. Johnson said criminal charges against the suspects two men and two women could be announced on Thursday . Investigators said they were not yet sure of a motive but could pursue hate crime and kidnapping charges if the evidence warranted . The victim knew one of his attackers the police said and had been taken from the suburbs to the city and held for some time before the beating was streamed online . “ Images in the video put on display the brazenness of the offenders who assaulted the victim and then broadcast it for the entire world to see ” Mr. Johnson said . The victim whom the police did not name was hospitalized for undisclosed injuries but had been released by Wednesday evening and was speaking with investigators . The police said he was “ traumatized ” and initially had trouble communicating with detectives . The video ’s spread online comes at a time of relentless violence in Chicago . In a Twitter post this week Mr. Trump cited Chicago ’s 762 murders last year and suggested that the city should seek federal help if local efforts to control the violence continued to be ineffective . Superintendent Johnson declined to speculate on whether the ’s Twitter message and the videotaped beating were connected . "
" It was a close call for the queen . A walk around the grounds of Buckingham Palace in the very early morning hours nearly got Queen Elizabeth II shot by one of her guards The Times of London reported on Wednesday . When she has a difficult time sleeping the queen will put on a raincoat and walk around the palace grounds The Times reported quoting a former guardsman . He was on patrol inside the palace walls at 3 a. m. on an unspecified day several years ago when he saw a figure in the darkness according to reports . Thinking he had spotted an intruder The Times said he called out “ Who ’s that ? ” “ To his surprise it was the queen ” according to the account . “ ‘ Bloody hell Your Majesty I nearly shot you ’ he blurted out . ” Realizing his remarks were inappropriate the guard expected to be rebuked . Instead The Times reported Her Majesty replied : “ That ’s quite all right . Next time I ’ll ring through beforehand so you don ’t have to shoot me . ” "
" Nearly 200 of the approximately 450 people who asked Gov. Peter Shumlin of Vermont to forgive their misdemeanor marijuana convictions had their wish fulfilled this week . In one of his final acts in office Governor Shumlin on Tuesday pardoned 192 people convicted of marijuana possession fulfilling a promise he made early last month to consider forgiveness for anyone who applied by Christmas . “ While attitudes and laws about marijuana use are rapidly changing there is still a harmful stigma associated with it ” Mr. Shumlin a Democrat said in a statement on Tuesday . “ My hope was to help as many individuals as I could overcome that stigma and the very real struggles that too often go along with it . ” Such charges can stand in the way of finding work being accepted to college and traveling internationally . The pardons were limited to people who had no violent criminal histories or felony convictions and who had not been found guilty of driving under the influence or reckless driving . People who did not apply for a pardon under Mr. Shumilin can still apply to have marijuana possession convictions expunged from their record through a court process established under a 2013 state decriminalization law . Mr. Shumlin cited that law and his own support for legalizing marijuana as the basis for the pardons . “ Vermont should follow the many states that are legalizing and regulating the use of marijuana and put to an end the incredible failure that is the War on Drugs ” he said in the statement . His successor Phil Scott a Republican has urged caution though he has signaled he may be open to legalization eventually . He is scheduled to be sworn in on Thursday and has said that he supports the pardons according to local news reports . Those who received the pardons ranged in age from 22 to 69 though most were younger than 40 . All but 15 live in Vermont . In all Mr. Shumlin has issued 208 pardons since taking office in 2010 more than any other governor in the history of the state his office said . "
" Perhaps the documentary “ Bright Lights : Starring Carrie Fisher and Debbie Reynolds ” would seem less poignant and compelling had its subjects not just died or had they not died stunningly within a day of each other . But the movie ’s plucky intimacy shines through that fog . It ’s a portrait not a tribute — though as the documentary reminds us every portrait is in some way a tribute to something . The film directed by the actor Fisher Stevens and Alexis Bloom debuts on HBO Saturday night after the cable network moved up its premiere from March . That decision is hard to begrudge . As this movie makes evident these two were no strangers to making headlines . Ms. Reynolds was well known to one generation for in part the tabloid bonanza surrounding her when her husband Eddie Fisher skipped out with her best friend Elizabeth Taylor . Several other generations have grown up surrounded by all things Princess Leia memorably played by Ms. Fisher in the “ Star Wars ” films . “ Bright Lights ” finds mother and daughter living in separate houses in what they call “ the compound . ” Ms. Fisher takes a soufflé out of her oven and carries it on a tray down the path to her mother ’s house . “ I usually come to her ” Ms. Fisher says .

Ms. Reynolds rose to fame with cheery wholesome roles and even in her 80 s could turn on that pert sunniness in a split second so smoothly you ’d never know it was an act — except that this is a documentary and it includes the footage of just before this light clicks on . “ It ’s not my best day ” she sighs
" WASHINGTON — President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia directed a vast cyberattack aimed at denying Hillary Clinton the presidency and installing Donald J. Trump in the Oval Office the nation ’s top intelligence agencies said in an extraordinary report they delivered on Friday to Mr. Trump . The officials presented their unanimous conclusions to Mr. Trump in a briefing at Trump Tower in New York that brought the leaders of America ’s intelligence agencies face to face with their most vocal skeptic the who has repeatedly cast doubt on Russia ’s role . The meeting came just two weeks before Mr. Trump ’s inauguration and was underway even as the electoral votes from his victory were being formally counted in a joint session of Congress . Soon after leaving the meeting intelligence officials released the declassified damning report that described the sophisticated cybercampaign as part of a continuing Russian effort to weaken the United States government and its democratic institutions . The report — a virtually revelation by the American intelligence agencies that undermined the legitimacy of the president who is about to direct them — made the case that Mr. Trump was the favored candidate of Mr. Putin . The Russian leader the report said sought to denigrate Mrs. Clinton and the report detailed what the officials had revealed to President Obama a day earlier : Mr. Trump ’s victory followed a complicated multipart cyberinformation attack whose goal had evolved to help the Republican win . The report did not conclude that Russian involvement tipped the election to Mr. Trump . The public report lacked the evidence that intelligence officials said was included in a classified version which they described as information on the sources and methods used to collect the information about Mr. Putin and his associates . Those would include intercepts of conversations and the harvesting of computer data from “ implants ” that the United States and its allies have put in Russian computer networks . Much of the unclassified report focused instead on an overt Kremlin propaganda campaign that would be unlikely to convince skeptics of the report ’s more serious conclusions . The report may be a political blow to Mr. Trump . But it is also a risky moment for the intelligence agencies that have become more powerful since the Sept. 112001 attacks but have had to fend off allegations that they exaggerated intelligence during the buildup to the Iraq war . The declassified report did describe in detail the efforts of Mr. Putin and his security services including the creation of the online Guccifer 2. 0 persona and DCLeaks . com to release information gained from the hacks to the public . “ Putin and the Russian Government aspired to help Trump ’s election chances when possible by discrediting Secretary Clinton and publicly contrasting her unfavorably to him ” the report by the nation ’s intelligence agencies concluded . Mr. Trump whose resistance to that very conclusion has led him to repeatedly mock the country ’s intelligence services on Twitter since Election Day issued a written statement that appeared to concede some Russian involvement . But Mr. Trump said nothing about the conclusion that Mr. Putin had sought to aid his candidacy other than insisting that he still believes the Russian attacks had no effect on the outcome . The ’s written statement came just hours after Mr. Trump told The New York Times in an interview that the storm surrounding Russian hacking was nothing more than a “ political witch hunt ” carried out by his adversaries who he said were embarrassed by their loss to him in the 2016 election . Speaking by telephone three hours before the intelligence briefing Mr. Trump repeatedly criticized the intense focus on Russia . “ China
" The intelligence agencies ’ report on the Russian intervention in the American presidential election portrays it as just one piece of an propaganda campaign . But it was a campaign made enormously more powerful by the tools of the cyberage : private emails pilfered by hackers an internet that reaches into most American homes social media to promote its revelations and smear enemies . What most Americans may have seen as a effort — brazen meddling by Russia in the very core of American democracy — was the report says only part of a information war that involves not just shadowy hackers and websites but also more conventional news outlets including the thriving Russian television network RT. The election intervention to damage Hillary Clinton and lift Donald J. Trump was the latest fusillade in a campaign that has gone on under the radar for years . For the three agencies that produced the report — the C. I. A. the F. B. I. and the National Security Agency — this is a moment : They have just told their new boss that he was elected with the vigorous multifaceted help of an adversary the thuggish autocrat who rules Russia . “ Putin and the Russian government aspired to help Trump ’s election chances when possible by discrediting Secretary Clinton and publicly contrasting her unfavorably to him ” the report says in unusually blunt and sweeping language . Perhaps most arresting is the assessment that Vladimir V. Putin the Russian president sees the election attack as payback — not offense but defense . He has borne a serious grudge against Mrs. Clinton who he believes denigrated him when she was secretary of state and encouraged the protests in Moscow that erupted against him in 2011 . Mr. Putin the report says sees the hidden hand of the United States in the leaking of the Panama Papers files stolen from a law firm that exposed the wealth of his closest associates secreted in offshore accounts . He even blames the United States for the exposure — carried out mainly by international sports authorities — of Russian athletes for their widespread use of drugs . “ From the Russian perspective this is punching back ” said Christopher Porter
" WASHINGTON — Smartphone users in Russia can no longer download the LinkedIn app on iPhone or Android devices following a similar move in China to block The New York Times app on iPhones . The demand by Russian authorities to remove LinkedIn in Apple and Google app stores comes weeks after a court blocked the professional networking service for flouting local laws that require internet firms to store data on Russian citizens within the nation ’s borders . The action is the equivalent of a nation banning “ Catcher in The Rye ” and then forcing booksellers to remove the title from their shelves . It puts Apple and Google in a difficult position . The companies are strong proponents of open internet policies and free speech but are now being asked to be agents for governments that censor its citizens . When LinkedIn ’s website was blocked the apps stopped functioning properly . Removing them from the Google Play store and Apple ’s App Store may not have cut off access to content but it sent a signal that countries can push the tech giants to remove the apps . Direct blocking of websites has been done by China Russia Turkey and several other nations for years usually through their internet service providers . But civil rights groups say the pressure authoritarian governments are now placing on Apple and Google is a new wrinkle . “ Apps are the new choke point of free expression ” said Rebecca MacKinnon who leads a project on open internet tracking at New America . Increasingly United States tech companies are complying with those demands . In the early 2000 s American internet firms strongly pushed back on demands by China to comply with censorship rules within the country ’s internet controls known as the Great Firewall . Recently Facebook has been working on a censorship tool to be able to access China where it is currently blocked along with Twitter and Google . LinkedIn which is owned by Microsoft said it was “ disappointed ” with the decision by Russian regulators to block the service which the company confirmed was extended to apps in Russian Apple and Google Play stores . “ It denies access to our members in Russia and the companies that use LinkedIn to grow their businesses ” said Nicole Leverich a spokeswoman for LinkedIn . Apple confirmed it was asked to remove its LinkedIn app in Russia about a month ago . It has also confirmed it was asked by China to block The New York Times app but declined to comment further on both events . Google would not confirm it has removed LinkedIn in Russia but said it adheres to local laws in the countries in which it operates . More nations have enforced their own internet laws in recent years . Turkey intermittently blocks social media such as during the attempted government coup last summer . It has also forced YouTube to remove content it considers disparaging of its founder Mustafa Kemal Ataturk . European nations have also drawn up their own privacy laws and in 2014 a court declared its citizens could demand internet companies like Google unlink information about users upon request . Tech companies and civil rights advocates warn that the increasing push by nations to create their own internet rules will Balkanize the internet and potentially lead to privacy violations and the stifling of political dissent .

" United States intelligence officials have determined that last year ’s cyberattacks on the World Agency originated with the Russian government perpetrated in apparent retaliation for what President Vladimir V. Putin deemed to be an effort to defame Russia for widespread doping . That conclusion was published Friday in a declassified intelligence report ordered by President Obama . The report centered on Russia ’s efforts to affect the 2016 American presidential election at Mr. Putin ’s direction while also referring to Russia ’s related “ influence efforts against targets such as Olympic athletes and other foreign governments . ” “ A prominent target since the 2016 Summer Olympics has been the World Agency ” the report said . WADA the global regulator of drugs in sports commissioned numerous investigations into systematic Russian doping last year . In July the agency recommended that Russia be barred from the 2016 Games in Rio de Janeiro for its doping program which persisted for years and spanned disciplines . Weeks later the regulator discovered that its database containing the private medical information of international athletes had been breached . A group identifying itself as Fancy Bear — a Russian cyberespionage group that forensics experts had tied to the Russian government — published the records of athletes who had received special clearance to take typically banned substances for medical reasons . In Friday ’s report American intelligence officials concluded that the Fancy Bear hacking had originated with Russia ’s main military intelligence unit the G. R. U. which had also begun working to influence the American election in March . Many of the records stolen from the doping regulator related to American athletes including Simone Biles the gymnast who won numerous medals in Rio and the tennis stars Venus and Serena Williams . The release of the records was an apparent attempt to discredit the athletes and paint the United States as hypocritical Friday ’s report stated . On Friday Catherine MacLean a spokeswoman for the antidoping agency pointed to the organization ’s statement in September condemning the criminal activity and noted that the agency had “ asked the Russian government to do everything in their power to make it stop . ” Russian news media and sports officials have repeatedly invoked the stolen records in recent months arguing that they are evidence of legalized doping and what they perceive to be the preferential treatment of Western athletes . Regulators and Olympic officials have repeatedly defended the affected athletes noting that they followed proper procedure and received formal clearance . “ Russia never had the opportunities that were given to other countries ” Vitaly Smirnov
" WASHINGTON — Rex W. Tillerson owns more than $ 50 million of Exxon Mobil stock has earned an annual salary of $ 10 million and holds a range of positions — from director at the Boy Scouts of America to the managing director of a Texas horse and cattle ranch . But Mr. Tillerson is prepared to resign from all those posts sell all his stock and put much of his money into bland investments like Treasury bonds if he becomes secretary of state according to an “ ethics undertakings ” memo he filed this week with the State Department . And if he returns to the oil industry in the next decade he could lose as much as $ 180 million . The ethics letter detailing Mr. Tillerson ’s commitments is the first of hundreds that will be made public in the coming weeks by members of Donald J. Trump ’s cabinet and other top political appointees presenting a historic test of the federal government ’s ability to identify conflicts of interest — and figure out ways to avoid them . Mr. Trump has selected what would be the wealthiest cabinet in modern American history filled with millionaires and billionaires with complicated financial portfolios . Mr. Tillerson is worth at least $ 300 million but is hardly the richest among them : Wilbur L. Ross Jr . the commerce secretary nominee Betsy DeVos the education secretary nominee and Steven T. Mnuchin the Treasury secretary nominee each hold assets estimated at more than a billion dollars . Jared Kushner Mr. Trump ’s wealthy is in the process of submitting his own forms as he prepares to take a formal White House position people involved in the process said . “ The Office of Government Ethics is stressed no doubt about that ” said Robert Rizzi a partner at Steptoe Johnson who represents half a dozen Trump administration nominees going through the process although he would not name them citing confidentiality agreements . “ They are having some difficulty keeping up . ” All of the cabinet appointees and hundreds of others must submit a financial disclosure report detailing all the assets they own their approximate value and income from any source they have made in the last year . Some of the nominees are so wealthy — and their assets so varied — there are not enough boxes on the standard form for them
" Donald J. Trump arrived at 1 World Trade Center a little before 10 a. m. on Friday to face some of his harshest critics in New York : top editors and digital directors of Condé Nast ’s stable of magazines among them Vanity Fair The New Yorker and Vogue . According to a tweet by Mr. Trump he had been invited by Anna Wintour Condé Nast ’s artistic director and the editor of Vogue . Also in attendance were Graydon Carter the editor of Vanity Fair who has sparred with Mr. Trump since his days as an editor at Spy magazine in the 1980 s and David Remnick the editor of The New Yorker who is an expert on Russia . They have been among Mr. Trump ’s most vocal detractors along with the writers at Teen Vogue . The meeting held in a conference room on the 42nd floor with a view of New Jersey lasted barely an hour . In answering questions from editors Mr. Trump addressed health care climate change relations with Russia women ’s issues and abortion rights . Mr. Trump mostly reiterated plans or policies he has discussed publicly for months according to two people who were apprised of the meeting but spoke on condition of anonymity because they had not been authorized to talk . When asked about health care for instance he told the group that he did not want to get rid of the Affordable Care Act until he had another plan in place one of the people said . Several editors contacted declined to discuss the meeting
" WASHINGTON — Eric Trump has helped raise $ 16 . 3 million for St. Jude Children ’s Research Hospital of Tennessee over the past decade a hospital official said in a letter sent to a charity run by Mr. Trump the ’s son . The letter comes as Mr. Trump is preparing to remove his name from the charity to avoid conflicts of interest that could emerge from future . The letter confirms an account Mr. Trump gave to reporters that his organization has raised more than $ 15 million for the hospital despite available tax records showing that the Eric Trump Foundation raised less than half that amount . Mr. Trump ’s announcement that he will remove his name from the organization is one of a series of steps that members of the Trump family are taking to address potential conflicts before the inauguration . Other steps include terminating planned Trump Organization projects in countries like Azerbaijan Brazil Colombia and Georgia . In addition to removing his name from his charitable foundation Mr. Trump will no longer personally solicit funds for it he said in several interviews with The New York Times . To further avoid conflicts Mr. Trump said in an email this week his and a Trump Organization executive will step down from the foundation ’s executive committee . The Trump Organization will continue to raise money for St. Jude from patrons at its hotels and golf courses Mr. Trump said . But it will ask them to make contributions directly to the hospital he said instead of first sending the money to the Trump Organization . The St. Jude letter said that since its establishment the Eric Trump Foundation had raised — or helped raise through affiliated groups — $ 16 . 3 million for the hospital which offers free care to needy children . Tax documents filed by nonprofit foundations are often delayed by two years so there is no public accounting of these totals yet available . The letter said that some of the money was raised via related efforts such as an Eric Trump team that participates in the New York City Marathon . “ I am amazed by the many ways that you have personally embraced our cause and cared for our children and families ” Richard C. Shadyac Jr . president of the hospital ’s organization wrote in the Dec. 30 letter which Mr. Trump provided to The Times . “ As you are aware we are expanding our lifesaving work and are working to push cure rates even higher in this country and around the world

" Good morning . ( Want to get California Today by email ? Here ’s the . ) Let ’s turn it over to Jonah Engel Bromwich for today ’s introduction . A California law that went into effect on Sunday barring drivers from holding phones while operating vehicles is among the most stringent in the nation . But experts say that it most likely won ’t be enough to prevent accidents caused by distracted driving . Jennifer Ryan AAA ’s director of state relations cautioned in a phone interview on Thursday that “ hands free is not risk free . ” Ms. Ryan said the California measure matched a larger trend of states bringing legislation with contemporary phones . But while the state ’s provisions were particularly broad she said it was important for motorists to take responsibility for themselves and pay attention . The law goes beyond what federal authorities recommend to prevent distracted driving which remains a significant cause of traffic fatalities . The latest statistics from the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration show that more than 3400 people died in 2015 in crashes that involved a distracted driver . Of those 272 were teenagers . And while the use of smartphones is certainly part of the problem many are unconvinced that keeping them out of drivers ’ hands will be a panacea . Some have speculated that the California law may encourage enthusiasm for cars . When Gov. Jerry Brown signed the measure into law in September he approved of another bill that allowed for the first tests of autonomous driving vehicles on public roads . Steve Finnegan the government affairs manager of the Automobile Club of Southern California said that while the new legislation “ is a step in the right direction ” it does not address “ the complete issue of distracted driving . ” “ One of the bigger issues is cognitive distraction ” Mr. Finnegan said . “ It ’s not what your hands are doing it ’s what your brain is doing . ” ( Please note : We regularly highlight articles on news sites that have metered paywalls . ) • Senator Dianne Feinstein will be at the center of the debate over Donald J.

" For years antinuclear activists concerned parents local officials and others have worried about Indian Point a nuclear plant on the Hudson River in northern Westchester County that provides cheap energy and robust tax revenue but also carries the risk of disaster . The news on Friday that the state had negotiated a deal that could shut down the plant within five years sent shock waves of jubilation relief and anxiety through the suburbs north of New York City . On one side was an almost gleeful disbelief that what had seemed an insurmountable goal — ridding the county of nuclear power — would come to pass . Nada Khader executive director of the Wespac Foundation a nonprofit group in White Plains that advocates social justice was told about the development by a reporter . “ This is really amazing for Wespac an organization whose many many members have been working for decades to shut Indian Point ” she said . “ All of us want to shift to safe energy . We absolutely welcome this news . ” But there were also misgivings about what the closing would mean for utility customers Indian Point employees and the nearby schools that rely on the plant ’s tax dollars . Officials in Westchester County said they were blindsided by the deal and were upset that they were not consulted . Robert P. Astorino the county executive and a vocal supporter of Indian Point which is in the village of Buchanan said more than $ 4 million enters the county ’s coffers every year from the plant representing nearly 1 percent of the tax base . “ No one from the governor ’s office had the common courtesy to call the county affected by this ” Mr. Astorino a Republican said . “ So we ’re all trying to figure out what will happen in the future and the costs of this potential closure . There are enormous economic consequences to something like this . ” Perhaps no single entity will suffer the financial effects of the shutdown more than Hendrick Hudson schools
" It has been a long time coming — eight years in fact — but the economic recovery is finally showing up in the average American worker ’s paycheck in a big way . There have been plenty of winners in the recovery which began in : companies homeowners investors and especially households at the apex of the economic pyramid . But the paucity of gains in pay has stoked anxiety and frustration for many others a factor in the wave of discontent that Donald J. Trump rode to victory in November . But even as Mr. Trump prepares to succeed President Obama in two weeks the Labor Department reported on Friday that average hourly earnings rose by 2. 9 percent last year the best annual performance since the recovery began . And many economists expect the trend to gain momentum this year as a tighter labor market forces employers to pay more to hire and retain workers . “ This is a turning point for the overall economy ” said Diane Swonk a veteran independent economist in Chicago . While wage growth was robust last year government data for December showed a more tepid increase in employment with 156000 jobs added during the month and a slight uptick in the unemployment rate to 4. 7 percent . Until recently a rise in salaries one month would peter out the next but the upward trajectory in 2016 reflects wage gains even for Americans at the low end of the pay scale Ms. Swonk said . Leisure and hospitality workers for example
1.0"FORT LAUDERDALE Fla . — Federal law enforcement officials said they were investigating whether the gunman who opened fire on Friday at the airport here killing five people and wounding eight was mentally disturbed and heard voices in his head telling him to commit acts of violence . According to a senior law enforcement official the gunman identified as Esteban Santiago 26 walked into the F. B. I. office in Anchorage in November and made disturbing remarks that prompted officials to urge him to seek mental health care . Mr. Santiago appearing “ agitated and incoherent ” said “ that his mind was being controlled by a U. S. intelligence agency ” the official said . Other officials said it was too early to tell whether Mr. Santiago who was captured in the airport had been inspired by terrorist groups including the Islamic State . The officials said he had viewed extremist materials on the internet . Shortly after 1 p. m. Friday the suspect who had been an airline passenger pulled a semiautomatic handgun out of his bag and opened fire in a crowded baggage claim area in Terminal 2 officials said . The shooting spurred a scene of panic and confusion that played out on live television as scores of travelers burst out of the terminal and onto the tarmac running and seeking cover
" Is your workout getting you nowhere ? Research and lived experience indicate that many people who begin a new exercise program see little if any improvement in their health and fitness even after weeks of studiously sticking with their new routine . Among fitness scientists these people are known as “ nonresponders . ” Their bodies simply don ’t respond to the exercise they are doing . And once discouraged they often return to being nonexercisers . But an inspiring and timely new study suggests that nonresponders to one form of exercise can probably switch to another exercise regimen to which their body will respond . And a simple test you can do at home will help you determine how well your workout is working for you . One of the first major studies to report the phenomenon of nonresponders appeared in 2001 when researchers parsed data from dozens of previously published studies of running cycling and other endurance exercise . The studies showed that on aggregate endurance training increased people ’s endurance . But when the researchers examined individual outcomes the variations were staggering . Some people had improved their endurance by as much as 100 percent while others had actually become less fit even though they were following the same workout routine . Age sex and ethnicity had not mattered the researchers noted . Young people and old had been outliers as had women and men black volunteers and white . Interestingly nonresponse to endurance training ran in families the researchers discovered suggesting that genetics probably plays a significant role in how people ’s bodies react to exercise . Since then other researchers have found that people can have extremely erratic reactions to weight training regimens with some packing on power and mass and others losing both . And a study published last year concentrating on brief bouts of intense interval training concluded that some people barely gained endurance with this type of workout while others flourished greatly augmenting their fitness . These studies
" CHICAGO — The appalling video seized the nation ’s attention this week : A group of young people kidnapped bound beat slashed gagged humiliated and threatened to kill a teenager with mental disabilities over nearly three days and laughed about it as they carried out their acts . But by far the most unusual thing about the episode advocates for people with disabilities have said was not the abuse itself but the fact that it was recorded . Violence against people with disabilities is far more common than most people realize advocates have said and frequently goes undetected or is not taken seriously . The victim in the attack here an white man suffered from schizophrenia and attention deficit disorder prosecutors said in court papers filed on Friday . The four accused attackers ranging in age from 18 to 24 are black . The four appeared on Friday in Cook County Circuit Court and Judge Maria Kuriakos Ciesil ordered them held without bail . The defendants are accused of multiple felonies including hate crimes . Prosecutors said the victim who was found by the police on Tuesday was targeted based on his race and his disability . During a Facebook video made by one of the defendants
" LOS ANGELES — To understand how Andrew Garfield successfully made the leap from to holy man it ’s helpful to know that when he was 8 his hero was Mahatma Gandhi . And that one of his life goals at the time was to seek out the schoolyard bully and envelop him in a warm embrace . “ He was a brilliant terror kind of like a ” Mr. Garfield recalled during an interview one warm night in the fall . “ My first impulse was to give him a hug and a kiss and tell him he was all right and that he didn ’t have to behave that way . ” He paused a few moments later adding “ Of course I became his main target because I saw him so deeply . ” After a few hours of conversation with Mr. Garfield about among other things celebrity toxicity spiritual steadfastness authentic living and God it was evident that Mr. Garfield sees many things deeply . This attribute was integral to his landing starring roles in two meaty movies that are receiving awards attention this season . The first is Mel Gibson ’s “ Hacksaw Ridge ” about Desmond T. Doss a World War II hero a Adventist and conscientious objector who refused to carry weaponry the part has landed Mr. Garfield his second Golden Globe nomination . The other is Martin Scorsese ’s “ Silence ” in which Mr. Garfield plays a Jesuit priest Sebastien Rodrigues on a mission in hostile Japan . Both directors said Mr. Garfield possessed a moral conviction necessary for playing their protagonists
" Every public housing complex in America is filled with individual tales of struggle and survival . This is the story of a dapper man in a black fedora who lives in unit 16G in the Bronx . His name is Souleymane Guengueng and he brought down a murderous African dictator . In the 1980 s Mr. Guengueng was one of numerous people imprisoned and tortured during the brutal reign of President Hissène Habré in Chad a landlocked country in central Africa . When he was released from prison after two and a half years Mr. Guengueng began a quest for justice meticulously recording the testimonies of survivors and the relatives of those who had been killed at the direction of Mr. Habré . He wound up with records detailing the abuse and murder of more than 700 people . Human rights advocates collected his accounts and used them as critical pieces of evidence to pursue criminal action against Mr. Habré . The legal case was not an easy one . Finding a court to prosecute a head of state proved difficult . For more than 16 years the case bounced between nations and continents with Mr. Guengueng offering his personal plea for justice to anyone who would listen . In May in Dakar Senegal where Mr. Habré had lived in exile the dictator was finally convicted . Next week a court there will hear his appeal . On the day of the guilty verdict a defiant Mr. Habré wearing dark glasses and with his head wrapped in white scarves as though he were bracing for a desert storm raised his fists and yelled to supporters in the courtroom . Mr. Guengueng was in the courtroom too his trademark hat on the seat beside him flanked by human rights advocates who had pursued justice against other dictators . He had been a key witness in the trial . Tears spilled from his eyes a mix of pride and revenge and sadness and relief . “ It was like an experience for me
" The city ’s Education Department plans to close or merge nine schools next year that are part of its turnaround initiative among a group of 22 schools to be closed or merged according to a document obtained by The New York Times . Mayor Bill de Blasio came into office saying that unlike his predecessor Michael R. Bloomberg he would support struggling schools rather than close them and he initiated the Renewal program in 2014 to offer extra money and services for 94 of the city ’s schools . “ We reject the notion of giving up on any of our schools ” Mr. de Blasio said at the time . Instead he said the city would infuse the schools in the program with resources including coaches to help teachers improve their practices new staff members to tackle problems like attendance and social services like dental clinics or counseling . He said his administration might still end up closing schools but he suggested that most schools would be given three years to improve . The program is now halfway through its third year . The department assigned each school a set of benchmarks in areas like attendance graduation rate and for elementary and middle schools performance on state reading and math exams . But the schools have shown uneven progress . Eight schools in the program met all of their targets last year while four schools met none and 17 others met only one or two out of six or seven targets . Many schools in the program have also seen their enrollment decline as families shun schools labeled failing . The city previously decided to close or merge eight Renewal schools so the latest round of closings will bring to 17 the number of schools in the program that will no longer be operating at least as before . Six of the schools will be closed entirely : Junior High School 162 Lola Rodriguez de Tio which had been singled out by the state as persistently failing and whose closing was previously announced Leadership Institute
" In an exit memorandum reflecting on eight years of United States foreign policy Secretary of State John Kerry enumerated the Obama administration ’s diplomatic accomplishments . But that record may be weakened or overturned by Donald J. Trump who has denigrated many of President Obama ’s policies . Here is a look at how the secretary and the see the major foreign policy issues differently . Kerry : Mr. Kerry praised the 2015 deal that the United States brokered with Iran to curtail that country ’s ability to produce nuclear weapons . Mr. Kerry wrote that before the deal was struck Iran was less than “ 90 days away from having the material necessary to produce one nuclear weapon ” but “ today they are at least a year away . ” He wrote on Thursday “ In reaching and implementing this deal we took a major security threat off the table without firing a single shot . ” Trump : Mr. Trump made criticism of the nuclear deal a major talking point of his foreign policy in the presidential campaign . He has called the agreement “ the worst deal ever negotiated . ” At a speech to the American Israel Public Affairs Committee in March he said “ My No. 1 priority is to dismantle the disastrous deal with Iran . ” Later he said he would renegotiate the agreement . Kerry : The secretary said that the United States tried to reset relations with Russia early in President Obama ’s first term but that a series of aggressions including “ unprecedented cyber intrusions ” “ military intervention in Syria ” and the “ illegal occupation ” of Ukraine impeded that effort . Trump : Mr. Trump has made improved relations with President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia a cornerstone of his future foreign policy . After American intelligence agencies provided evidence that Russians hacked Democratic National Committee systems to help tip the election in his favor Mr. Trump criticized the reliability of the intelligence community . He has praised Mr. Putin and said he would work closely with him to combat the Islamic State . Mr. Trump also seemed to upend American nuclear weapons policy when he declared in December : “ Let it be an arms race . We will outmatch them at every pass and outlast them all . ” Kerry : Mr. Kerry devoted a significant portion of his memo to climate change calling it “ not just a threat to the future of our planet but a growing and immediate threat to our national security . ” He lauded an agreement struck between President Obama and President Xi Jinping of China which bolstered a global climate agreement reached in Paris in 2015 that he called the most “ ambitious inclusive climate agreement ever negotiated . ” Trump : Mr. Trump has called climate change a “ hoax ” said he would “ cancel ” the Paris accords and vowed to dismantle the Environmental Protection Agency “ in almost every form . ” His nominee to run that agency is Scott Pruitt the Oklahoma attorney general and a close ally of the fossil fuel industry who has led the legal battle against Mr. Obama ’s policies . Kerry : Though the Obama administration never fulfilled a promise to shutter the Guantánamo Bay detention center
1.0"We hope you got some rest over the holidays but it ’s clear from our mailbox that you remained sharp and attentive readers . We will address a few of those complaints first before turning to this week ’s topics . A Social Q ’s column which administers lighthearted advice about awkward social situations addressed what an adult should do when one child taunts another at a holiday party . The specific taunt in question which was directed toward a Latina girl was this : “ Pack your bags . Trump is going to send you back to Mexico . ” The headline on the column ? “ Should I Stay Silent During One Child ’s Populist Taunt of Another ? ” Readers took issue with the description of the taunt . The author of the column Philip Galanes took the time to reply to a reader who wrote to him directly . Shortly before the new year an ad ran on a Times story that left some readers befuddled . The ad was indeed a hoax and readers who realized this have asked The Times to address the issue . Indeed such ads do seem to find their way onto the Times website occassionally as a public editor column explained in November but we asked Sebastian Tomich senior vice president for advertising and innovation to comment once more . Here ’s his response : An hour into the new year tragedy struck in Turkey when a gunman attacked an Istanbul nightclub . The lead byline on The Times ’s story was anonymous — “ an Employee of The New York Times ” — and readers had theories as to why . The public editor ’s take : We ’ve received several letters asking about the unusual byline . The international editor Michael Slackman said he ’s not in position to comment but I suspect you are hinting at the right issues in your letter . From my experience
" RIO DE JANEIRO — Some of the inmates were beheaded . Others had their hearts torn from their bodies . Gang leaders used the blood of their victims to write a nightmarish message of retribution : “ Blood is paid for with blood . ” The harrowing scenes on Friday from the latest prison riot in Brazil in which 31 inmates were killed in the northern state of Roraima in the Amazon River Basin pushed the death toll to 93 in six days of mayhem in penitentiaries around the country . The bloodshed has shocked the country and is emerging as the most pressing crisis facing President Michel Temer whose beleaguered government was already grappling with graft scandals a weak economy and simmering anger over austerity measures . “ The bloodshed is revealing a war between drug gangs a failed prison system and a weak government ” said Rafael Alcadipani a scholar who specializes in public security policies at Fundação Getúlio Vargas a leading Brazilian university . “ And now the horror is spreading . ” Prison violence that has spilled out into neighboring communities has been a perennial problem in Brazil . In 2006 street fighting between the police and First Capital Command a gang left almost 200 people dead in São Paulo causing chaos in the city of 20 million people . The killings in Roraima came just days after 56 men were killed in a massacre at a prison in the city of Manaus . In two different riots at prisons this week in the states of Amazonas and Paraíba six men were also killed . The violence at the Monte Cristo Agricultural Penitentiary in Boa Vista the capital of Roraima adds to fears about an intensifying war between drug gangs for control of the cocaine trade in the Amazon region in Brazil . The latest episode is thought to involve fighting between First Capital Command commonly known by its Portuguese initials P. C. C. which has roots in the prisons of São Paulo in southeastern Brazil and supporters of Red Command a drug trafficking organization that has long held sway in Rio de Janeiro . The authorities however
" A controversial experiment with a workday in one of Sweden ’s largest cities wrapped up this week with a cheerful conclusion : Shorter working hours make for happier healthier and more productive employees . There ’s just one catch . The practice is too expensive and unwieldy to become widespread in Sweden anytime soon . The trial which took place in the southern city of Gothenburg centered on a municipal retirement home where workers were switched to a day from eight hours with no pay cut . Seventeen new nursing positions were created to make up for the loss of time at a cost of around 700000 euros or $ 738 000 a year . Although it was small the experiment stoked a widespread discussion about the future of work namely whether investing in a better balance for employees and treating workers well rather than squeezing them benefits the bottom line for companies and economies . “ The trial showed that there are many benefits of a shorter working day ” said Daniel Bernmar the leader of the Left party on Gothenburg ’s City Council which had pushed for the experiment . “ They include healthier staff a better work environment and lower unemployment . ” But the high price tag and political skepticism about the practicality of a shorter workday
" While many of us weren ’t paying attention some credit card bonuses became so large that the analysts at Bernstein Research wondered in November if the industry was afflicted with temporary insanity . One particular bit of madness — a Chase offer that effectively puts $ 1 500 in your pocket without a lot of effort if you are a relatively big spender — is close to ending and many people have just a few more days to take advantage of it . But the mere existence of bonuses on top of the points and perks that come with everyday spending raises a number of questions for consumers . Even if you thought you had had enough of to get the best deals shouldn ’t you at least grab those 15 bills if you have the means ? Or might the offers actually get better ? And is it time to bet against the stocks of the maniac bankers who are tossing around offers like this ? CHASE TODAY ? First things first : That giant bonus comes from the Chase Sapphire Reserve card . Here ’s how it works ( and don ’t confuse it with the similarly named Preferred card ) : If the bank accepts your application you have three months to spend $ 4 000 . Once you do Chase hands over 100000 of its proprietary rewards points . Then you can trade them for $ 1 500 worth of travel as long as you book your flights or rooms through Chase . The card has a $ 450 annual fee but it gives back $ 300 of it each year once you purchase at least that amount in travel . It also gives out a generous amount of points — three per dollar spent — on travel and dining . Plus you can swap points for miles on many airlines if you want to take your chances with seat availability in those reward schemes . Other perks include access to some airport lounges and a rebate for fees you pay for TSA PreCheck the expedited security screening or Global Entry which speeds international returns . In cardland any offer this lucrative tends not to last . This week Chase said it would cut the bonus in half for anyone who applied online after Jan. 12 or in a branch ( which isn ’t possible for people in parts of the country where there are no Chase branches ) after March 12 . To be safe the company suggests applying online by Jan. 11

" You have probably heard it yourself : the impression that millennials are financial freewheelers . The theory goes that today ’s or spend with little regard for savings and even less regard for retiring . Retirement planning experts say that this assumption isn ’t entirely accurate — though it is perennially true that most young adults don ’t make retirement savings a financial priority . But as the experts point out millennials are in an ideal position to get started because whatever they set aside will grow and accrue interest greatly over time . “ The value of compounding means you ’ll have to contribute less later ” said Maria Bruno a senior investment strategist at Vanguard the investment management company . She recommends that people open retirement accounts as early as they can — that way the savings have more time to build and be reinvested . Eventually the interest an account accrues will begin to earn interest of its own . The New York Times spoke to five people in the to age group a small sample of millennial savers . Two experts from the retirement division of Prudential Financial offered advice and feedback on each person ’s profile . Though advice differed based on the individual situation advisers across the spectrum were consistent on two broader points : ■ Young investors should take advantage of Roth retirement fund options . Roth funds which include individual retirement accounts and 401( k) ’s differ from traditional retirement accounts in that contributions are made after tax once money is invested earnings and withdrawals are . ■ Younger workers should contribute at least as much as an employer is willing to match in a 401( k ) or similar program . With this advice in mind read a snapshot of millennials at various stages of retirement planning . Mr. LaCasse doesn ’t see himself jetting off to exotic destinations at the end of his career but he does hope to have some financial security and independence . He makes about $ 52 000 a year and contributes 4 percent of every paycheck to a 403( b ) account — a retirement account primarily for teachers . His school does not match his contributions but he did receive an initial contribution of $ 1 200 . He currently has about $ 6

" WASHINGTON — A day after the release of a damning intelligence report on Russia ’s efforts to influence the American election Donald J. Trump called on Saturday for a closer relationship between the two nations saying only “ stupid ” people or “ fools ” would think this was unwise . The United States Mr. Trump wrote in a series of Twitter messages Saturday morning has “ enough problems around the world without yet another one . ” He pledged that Russia would “ respect us far more than they do now ” after he is sworn in as president and said that the two nations could perhaps work together on the international stage . For years Russia has been anything but a willing partner of the United States . Relations became strained well before the cyberattacks began nearly a year and a half ago despite the Obama administration ’s early effort to reset relations . After Russia ’s intrusion into Ukraine and its annexation of Crimea in 2014 the United States and its allies levied broad sanctions against the Russian economy and blacklisted dozens of its citizens including some close to the Russian president Vladimir V. Putin . President Obama added to those measures last month in retaliation for the hacking expelling 35 suspected Russian intelligence operatives from the United States and imposing sanctions on two Russian intelligence services . Russia and the United States have also often been at odds over Moscow ’s involvement in the war in Syria . Senior intelligence officials briefed Mr. Trump on their findings on Russian election interference on Friday before releasing a declassified report that concluded that Mr. Putin had “ ordered ” a sprawling campaign intended to denigrate Hillary Clinton and aid Mr. Trump . Mr. Trump has consistently dismissed the intelligence agencies ’ conclusions as politically motivated but he appeared to soften that stance in a statement his transition team released after the briefing . He also seemingly conceded Russian involvement in the election but he has taken pains to point out that there is no evidence that any vote tallies were altered apparently seeking to avoid the suggestion that his victory was illegitimate . Mr. Trump has said repeatedly that it is time to “ move on ” from the focus on Russian meddling in the election arguing that it has received such attention only because Democrats are embarrassed about their loss — an assertion he repeated on Twitter on Saturday . Late on Friday he blamed the Democratic National Committee for the hacking of its computer systems saying that “ gross negligence ” had allowed it to happen . Many Democrats said on Twitter that Mr. Trump was essentially engaging in . "
" WASHINGTON — As Senate Republicans embark on a flurry of confirmation hearings this week several of Donald J. Trump ’s appointees have yet to complete the background checks and ethics clearances customarily required before the Senate begins to consider nominees . Republicans who are expected to hold up to five hearings on Wednesday alone say they simply want to ensure that the new president has a team in place as soon as possible . “ I believe all the ’s cabinet appointments will be confirmed ” Senator Mitch McConnell of Kentucky the majority leader said . But Democrats are calling for the process to be slowed and for the hearings to be spread out . That they say would allow more time to vet the nominees . “ Our first overarching focus is getting tax returns and ethics forms ” said Senator Amy Klobuchar Democrat of Minnesota . In a letter to Senators Chuck Schumer of New York and Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts the leader of the Office of Government Ethics Walter M. Shaub Jr . said on Friday that “ the announced hearing schedule for several nominees who have not completed the ethics review process is of great concern to me . ” He said the packed schedule had put “ undue pressure ” on the office to rush its reviews of the nominees and he knew of no other occasion in the office ’s four decades when the Senate had held a confirmation hearing before the review was completed . Mr. Schumer responded on Saturday by saying that the letter had made clear that the Trump transition team colluded with Senate Republicans to “ jam through ” the nominees . Several of the nominees are millionaires or billionaires and have vast webs of financial interests that must be untangled . The Trump transition team issued a statement on Saturday evening defending its handling of the nomination process . Richard W. Painter a law professor at the University of Minnesota who served as chief ethics counsel to President George W. Bush said he thought none of the nominees could receive a full vote on the Senate floor before the vetting was complete . Norman Eisen Mr. Obama ’s ethics counsel in his first term said the paperwork delays were “ totally . ” The status of the background checks and ethical clearances can change by the day . Republicans say they expect the missing documents to be submitted for all the nominees eventually . The hearings are scheduled to begin on Tuesday with testimony from Senator Jeff Sessions of Alabama the nominee for attorney general and Gen. John F. Kelly the pick for homeland security secretary .

1.0"FORT LAUDERDALE Fla . — Signs of Esteban Santiago ’s unraveling had mounted over the past year . But it was not until early November when he walked into an F. B. I. office carrying an ammunition clip — leaving a pistol and his infant son in his car — to complain about a C. I. A. plot against him that his behavior became disturbing enough to earn him a short stay in a psychiatric hospital unit . In the months before the police were called repeatedly to his home about domestic disturbances and the National Guard kicked him out because of “ unsatisfactory performance ” after nearly a decade of service . Mr. Santiago an Iraq war veteran increasingly spoke to relatives and associates about voices in his head that were tormenting him . Then a little before 1 p. m. Friday Mr. Santiago 26 turned up far from his Alaska home in Terminal 2 of the Fort International Airport . There law enforcement officials said he retrieved his checked luggage pulled a handgun out of his suitcase and used it to kill five people and wound six others setting off a panic that shut down the airport . After running out of ammunition he lay on the floor waiting quietly to be arrested
" The United States system for taxing businesses is a mess . If there ’s one thing nearly everyone can agree upon it is that . The current corporate income tax manages the weird trick of both taxing companies at a higher statutory rate than other advanced countries while collecting less money as a percentage of the overall economy than most of them . It is infinitely complicated and it gives companies incentives to borrow too much money and move operations to countries with lower tax rates . Now the moment for trying to fix all of that appears to have arrived . With the House Senate and presidency all soon to be in Republican hands and with all agreeing that a major tax bill is a top priority some kind of change appears likely to happen . And it may turn out to be a very big deal particularly if a tax plan that House Republicans proposed last summer becomes the core of new legislation . Among Washington ’s lobbying shops and policy analysis crowd it ’s known as a “ cash flow tax with border adjustment . ” It ’s easier to think of it as the most substantial reworking of how businesses are taxed since the corporate income tax was introduced a century ago . And it could if enacted have big effects not just in the tax departments of major corporations but in global financial markets and the aisles of your local Walmart . This possible revamping of the corporate tax code is less politically polarizing than the debates sure to unfold in the months ahead over health care or even over individual income taxes . But the consequences for business — and for the trajectory of the economy — are huge . The basic idea behind a D. B. C. F. T. ( to use the abbreviation that has taken hold in a particularly nerdy corner of Twitter ) is this : Right now companies are taxed based on their income generated in the United States . But there are countless tricks that corporate accountants can play to reduce the income companies report and to reduce their tax burden and those tricks distort the economy . Two prime examples are transferring intellectual property to overseas holding companies and engaging in corporate inversions that move a company ’s legal headquarters to a country with lower taxes . Moreover because interest payments on debt are the current system makes it appealing to take on as much debt as possible even though that can increase the risk of bankruptcy when a downturn comes along . The House Republicans ’ approach instead of taxing the corporate income goes after a firm ’s domestic cash flow : money that comes in from sales within the United States borders minus money that goes out to pay employees and buy supplies and so forth . There ’s no incentive to play games with overseas companies that exist only to exploit tax differences or to relocate production to countries with lower taxes because you ’ll be taxed on things you sell in the United States regardless . “ With an income tax one of the key issues is ‘ how do you measure income ’ ” said Alan Auerbach an economist at the University of California
" WASHINGTON — As congressional Republicans on Friday discussed quickly moving ahead with plans for a southern border wall using money included in this year ’s spending bills Donald J. Trump insisted that Mexico would ultimately pay for its construction . “ We ’re going to get reimbursed ” Mr. Trump said during a brief telephone interview . “ But I don ’t want to wait that long . But you start and then you get reimbursed . ” The congressional Republicans ’ talk led to speculation that Mr. Trump was retreating on his campaign promise to make Mexico pay for the wall . Mr. Trump insisted he is not . Republicans have balked at increases in domestic spending during the Obama administration and are unlikely to enthusiastically rally behind a proposal that could require billions of taxpayer dollars . Building a wall to keep out unauthorized immigrants could also face intense opposition from a bipartisan coalition in Congress that argues that a vast barrier along the border would be ineffective in stopping people who are determined to enter the country illegally and would represent a symbolic affront to the idea that the United States is a welcoming country that embraces immigration . In the interview Mr. Trump vowed that Mexico would ultimately reimburse the United States . He said that payment would most likely emerge from his efforts to renegotiate the North American Free Trade Agreement with the Mexican government . “ It ’s going to be part of everything ” Mr. Trump said of the cost of building the wall . “ We are going to be making a much better deal . It ’s a deal that never should have been signed . ” But he said that the trade negotiations would take time and that he supported the idea of using taxpayer money to begin construction of the border wall “ in order to speed up the process . ” The full cost of a wall as described by Mr. Trump could be enormous . Attaching such a charged issue to annual mandatory government funding measures could instigate a risky political fight . Those who want to block money for the wall by holding up the bills could find themselves accused of shutting down the government . The Government Accountability Office has estimated it could cost $ 6. 5 million per mile to build a fence with an additional $ 4. 2 million per mile for roads and more fencing according to congressional officials . Those estimates do not include maintenance of the fence along the nearly border with Mexico . “ The chairman and the committee have no interest in threatening a shutdown ” said Jennifer Hing a spokeswoman for the House Appropriations Committee referring to Representative Rodney Frelinghuysen Republican of New Jersey and the committee ’s new chairman . If funding for the border wall is included in spending bills this spring it would provide money to begin construction on a barrier that was authorized by legislation passed in 2006 but was never completed . Ms. Hing said neither Mr. Trump ’s transition team nor Republican leaders had asked for funding to build a wall on the Mexican border . “ If and when a proposal is received we will take a careful look at it ” she said in an email on Friday . At a rally in August in Phoenix hours after meeting with President Enrique Peña Nieto of Mexico Mr. Trump vowed that America ’s southern neighbor would bear the financial burden of securing the border . “ Mexico will pay for the wall believe me — 100 percent — they don ’t know it yet but they will pay for the wall
" At the Salk Institute in La Jolla Calif. scientists are trying to get time to run backward . Biological time that is . In the first attempt to reverse aging by reprogramming the genome they have rejuvenated the organs of mice and lengthened their life spans by 30 percent . The technique which requires genetic engineering cannot be applied directly to people but the achievement points toward better understanding of human aging and the possibility of rejuvenating human tissues by other means . The Salk team ’s discovery reported in the Thursday issue of the journal Cell is “ novel and exciting ” said Jan Vijg an expert on aging at the Albert Einstein College of Medicine in New York . Leonard Guarente who studies the biology of aging at M. I. T. said “ This is huge ” citing the novelty of the finding and the opportunity it creates to slow down if not reverse aging . “ It ’s a pretty remarkable finding and if it holds up it could be quite important in the history of aging research ” Dr. Guarente said . The finding is based on the heterodox idea that aging is not irreversible and that an animal ’s biological clock can in principle be wound back to a more youthful state . The aging process is clocklike in the sense that a steady accumulation of changes eventually degrades the efficiency of the body ’s cells . In one of the deepest mysteries of biology the clock ’s hands are always set back to zero at conception : However old the parents and their reproductive cells a fertilized egg is free of all marks of age . Ten years ago the Japanese biologist Shinya Yamanaka amazed researchers by identifying four critical genes that reset the clock of the fertilized egg . The four genes are so powerful that they will reprogram even the genome of skin or intestinal cells back to the embryonic state . Dr. Yamanaka ’s method is now routinely used to change adult tissue cells into cells very similar to the embryonic stem cells produced in the first few divisions of a fertilized egg . Scientists next began to wonder if the four Yamanaka genes could be applied not just to cells in glassware but to a whole animal . The results were disastrous . As two groups of researchers reported in 2013 and 2014
" IT’S one of the things we are most afraid might happen to us . We go to great lengths to avoid it . And yet we do it all the same : We marry the wrong person . Partly it ’s because we have a bewildering array of problems that emerge when we try to get close to others . We seem normal only to those who don ’t know us very well . In a wiser more society than our own a standard question on any early dinner date would be : “ And how are you crazy ? ” Perhaps we have a latent tendency to get furious when someone disagrees with us or can relax only when we are working perhaps we ’re tricky about intimacy after sex or clam up in response to humiliation . Nobody ’s perfect . The problem is that before marriage we rarely delve into our complexities . Whenever casual relationships threaten to reveal our flaws we blame our partners and call it a day . As for our friends they don ’t care enough to do the hard work of enlightening us . One of the privileges of being on our own is therefore the sincere impression that we are really quite easy to live with . Our partners are no more . Naturally we make a stab at trying to understand them . We visit their families . We look at their photos we meet their college friends . All this contributes to a sense that we ’ve done our homework . We haven’t . Marriage ends up as a hopeful generous infinitely kind gamble taken by two people who don ’t know yet who they are or who the other might be binding themselves to a future they cannot conceive of and have carefully avoided investigating . For most of recorded history people married for logical sorts of reasons : because her parcel of land adjoined yours his family had a flourishing business her father was the magistrate in town there was a castle to keep up or both sets of parents subscribed to the same interpretation of a holy text . And from such reasonable marriages there flowed loneliness infidelity abuse hardness of heart and screams heard through the nursery doors . The marriage of reason was not

" BEIJING — A few months after Lu Qiumei gave birth to her daughter in 2012 local officials visited her home and told her that she was required to be fitted with an intrauterine device . For more than three decades this was national policy in China . The IUD was the government ’s most important tool for limiting couples to one child and almost all new mothers were required to get one . Ms. Lu a former advertising executive considered the demand invasive insulting and potentially harmful to her health . Still like hundreds of millions of Chinese women before her she made an appointment with a state gynecologist and had one put in . Now a year after abandoning the “ ” policy the government is hoping to make it up to Ms. Lu and millions of women like her — by removing their IUDs free of charge . But the offer made without even a hint of an apology has provoked incredulous outrage . “ We shouldn ’t even have had this in the first place and now the government wants to use it as a form of state benefit for people ” Ms. Lu 36 scoffed in a phone interview from her home in the eastern city of Linyi . “ It ’s like they are slapping themselves in the face . ” While IUDs elsewhere can often be removed with the tug of their strings in a doctor ’s office surgery is usually needed in China because most devices here are designed or altered to be more difficult to extract some with shortened strings and others with no strings at all . But many Chinese women have chafed at the thought of the government ’s getting involved

" MEXICO CITY — An official working at the United States consulate in Guadalajara the city in Mexico was shot and wounded on Friday evening by a young man who stalked him in the parking lot of a shopping mall and then fired as he drove out . The State Department official who was not identified was in stable condition after the shooting a spokeswoman from the United States Embassy in Mexico City said on Saturday . Neither embassy officials nor the Mexican attorney general ’s office commented on a possible motive . Guadalajara is the capital of Jalisco the headquarters of the New Generation Jalisco cartel an organized crime gang that has carried out violent attacks on the Mexican military and police over the past two years . But residents of the city have rarely been a focus of cartel violence . Security footage released by the consulate on its Facebook page shows the gunman dressed in a loosefitting dark blue and pants and wearing glasses waiting on the sidewalk adjacent to the exit ramp of an underground parking lot in an upscale neighborhood . A white car pulls up to the barrier gate waits for the arm to lift and drives off . Then as the consular official ’s black car pulls up the gunman raises his arm fires and runs away . In a separate video taken a few minutes earlier at 6:16 p. m. the consular official wearing red shorts and with a gym bag slung over his shoulder pays at the automated ticket machine and walks off with the gunman following him . The F. B. I. said it was offering a $ 20 000 reward to anybody who could provide information leading to the identification of the gunman . “ The safety and security of our employees overseas is our highest priority ” the United States Embassy spokeswoman said .

" KABUL Afghanistan — Approximately 300 United States Marines will return this spring to help fight a resurgent Taliban in the southern Afghan province of Helmand the site of a yearslong bloody campaign American officials in Afghanistan said on Saturday . An American military spokesman in Kabul said the Marines would replace an Army unit stationed in Helmand and would offer training and advice to members of the Afghan military and the national police . “ The Marine rotation is to replace soldiers currently here conducting the train advise and assist mission ” said Brig. Gen. Charles H. Cleveland a spokesman for United States forces in Afghanistan . “ We ’re very pleased that the Marines will rotate in as they have tremendous institutional history in the region . ” The Marines were last in Helmand a hotbed of Taliban fighters and poppy cultivation in October 2014 . Since then Afghan forces suffering from leadership woes and plagued by corruption have struggled to hold territory with district after district falling to the Taliban . For months now the insurgents have been at the gates of the provincial capital Lashkar Gah . The Afghan military welcomed the news of the Marines ’ return . “ We have been asking our foreign counterparts in security meetings to increase the level of their troops in Helmand Province to help us on the battlefields ” said Shakil Ahmad an Afghan Army spokesman . Mr. Ahmad said the security situation in region was rapidly deteriorating . The Taliban appeared unfazed by the news of the Marines ’ return . “ Our mujahedeen continued their progress in the presence of tens of thousands of Americans and other invading forces ” said Qari Yousef Ahmadi a Taliban spokesman . “ A few hundred other soldiers won ’t become an obstacle on the way of our progress . ” Fewer than 8

Osweiler threw for a touchdown and ran for another to lead the Texans to the win in the round . Clowney erasing doubts that he deserved to be the top pick in the 2014 draft got his first career interception on the Raiders ’ second drive . Osweiler who got his job back last week after Tom Savage sustained a concussion finished with only 168 passing yards but played his best game of the season . “ It just goes back to having confidence in my teammates ” said Osweiler who had never played in a playoff game having been benched by the Denver Broncos last postseason in favor of Peyton Manning . “ Believing in what you see and just rip it .

" ISTANBUL — An Islamic State disciple kills 39 New Year ’s revelers at an Istanbul nightclub . A gunman with a police badge assassinates Russia ’s ambassador at an Ankara reception . Kurdish separatist bombers kill 14 soldiers on a bus in central Turkey and dozens of police officers at an Istanbul soccer match . Those assaults were just in the last few weeks which made a car bombing on Thursday in the city of Izmir where at least two civilians were killed seem relatively minor . The 75 million people of Turkey the NATO member and European Union aspirant that straddles Europe and Asia and was once seen as a stable democracy are facing a ferocious onslaught of terrorist attacks unlike anything that has been seen in the West . Add to that the tumult from roughly three million Syrian war refugees a resurgent Kurdish insurgency and a failed military coup — all tied in the eyes of many Turks to American negligence or malice or both . President Recep Tayyip Erdogan has responded with a furious crackdown on an array of perceived enemies including the news media and has lashed out at what he regards as Western complicity . While Mr. Erdogan ’s critics have denounced what they see as a bald usurpation of power that has subverted democracy and polarized the country many Turks frightened and uncertain are not complaining . They view his authoritarianism as reassuring and angrily reject outsider comments about paranoia and conspiracy theories . Some are even embracing the advent of Donald J. Trump despite his statements viewing him as a decisive strongman sympathetic to Mr. Erdogan an Islamist with little tolerance for those who dispute him .

" Don ’t worry . It ’s totally natural . There ’s no mother ship hovering above the earth waiting to carry you away and no demon shooting light from beneath signaling to pull you below . It ’s a light pillar — or a few of them — a colorful column of sparkling light that appears to beam up toward the sky . It ’s all just an icy illusion . And now during winter when nights are long and cold you have a good chance to spot one as long as conditions are right . If you ’re lucky enough to spot a light pillar what you ’re seeing is actually artificial light from a ground source reflecting off millions of floating ice crystals . “ It ’s not an upward beam of light ” said Les Cowley a physicist who runs a website on atmospheric optics or the way light travels through the atmosphere . “ Although they look pretty they ’re also a sign that someone somewhere could do better with their lighting . You might call them light pollution pillars if you wanted to be environmental about it . ” Light pillars occur when clouds — normally miles high in the atmosphere — cling closer to the Earth ’s surface just a hundred or a few thousand feet above it . These thin clouds contain millions of flat hexagonal crystals of ice that float horizontally in the air Each ice crystal acts like a mirror pointed downward reflecting the artificial light back to your eyes — as long as the cloud is about halfway between you and the light source . Together the crystals form a cluster of mirrors floating at different heights which allows you to see the light as a column if they all were at the same level you ’d see only a spot of light . The pillars can be quite colorful at times because each reflected beam is the same color as its source . To find a good source — one bright close to the ground
1.0"Tilikum the captive orca who killed a trainer at SeaWorld in Orlando Fla . in 2010 and later became the subject of the documentary “ Blackfish ” died on Friday . The whale had been suffering from a persistent infection from a bacteria found in wild habitats and natural settings but the exact cause of death will be determined by a necropsy SeaWorld Parks Entertainment said in a statement . The orca a male estimated to be about 36 years old had been kept by the organization for 25 years . “ While today is a difficult day for the SeaWorld family it ’s important to remember that Tilikum lived a long and enriching life while at SeaWorld and inspired millions of people to care about this amazing species ” the statement said . “ Tilikum had and will continue to have a special place in the hearts of the SeaWorld family as well as the millions of people all over the world that he inspired ” said the president of SeaWorld Joel Manby . Tilikum ’s caretakers had said in March that the whale was afflicted with the infection that was likely to lead to his death . The whale was at the center of an orca breeding program that SeaWorld ended last year . The company also ended its killer whale performances in San Diego where state lawmakers had brought intense pressure on the company after the documentary ’s release . With the death of Tilikum SeaWorld now holds 22 orcas at its three facilities in Orlando San Antonio and San Diego . SeaWorld also noted that Tilikum was “ inextricably connected ” with the death of his trainer Dawn Brancheau

" SAN FRANCISCO — In 1949 a Life magazine photographer named Gjon Mili made a pilgrimage to the French Riviera to see Pablo Picasso . Mili had come up with a way to photograph trails of light and he wanted to shoot Picasso “ drawing ” in midair with a light pen — a process that would leave no trace except on film . Picasso loved it . The result published in Life and exhibited at the Museum of Modern Art was Picasso ’s celebrated series of “ light drawings ” of bulls and centaurs and the like — photographs that captured him in the act of creating the ultimate in ephemeral art. Picasso is long gone . But some 68 years later Google has been calling on dozens of artists animators and illustrators with a update of Mili ’s concept — a virtual reality setup that enables people to paint with light that actually stays where you put it at least for viewers wearing a VR headset . In place of Gjon Mili are Drew Skillman and Patrick Hackett a pair of video game developers turned virtual reality enthusiasts who live in San Francisco . They were trying to build a chess application one night a couple of years ago when they discovered it had an unexpected side effect : As you moved the chess pieces around in virtual space they left trails of light behind . Sensing that their bug was in fact a feature the two dropped the chess project immediately and hurled themselves at the light trails hoping to develop a tool for drawing in three dimensions . In April 2015 seven months after they had cobbled together a rudimentary system they called Tilt Brush Google bought their company for an undisclosed sum — which is how Mr. Skillman and Mr. Hackett have come to be ensconced in the company ’s offices near the downtown waterfront here . With Google ’s support Tilt Brush has attracted a team of developers and evolved into a sophisticated tool for drawing painting even sculpting in space . It was released in April as a free to the new HTC Vive an $ 800 virtual reality system produced by the Taiwanese manufacturer HTC in partnership with Valve an American video game developer . ( It ’s on sale as a $ 30 software package from Valve ’s online store . ) Reviewers immediately dubbed it the Vive ’s killer app . This is hardly the kind of reception the two inventors were expecting when they started working on it in Mr. Skillman ’s apartment a studio in South Park the little neighborhood that has been a hub for San Francisco ’s digerati since the 1990 s . “ Not in our wildest dreams
" She skipped almost every class her sophomore year and still maintained perfect attendance . The trick was to drop in for the start of third period wait for attendance to be recorded for the day and then leave with a bathroom pass . By the time her mother found out about the scheme Skylynn Vazquez was failing every subject . Most days Saquan Bright did not bother to show up at Boys and Girls High School in Brooklyn . He chose to roam the streets with his friends . But then Ms. Vazquez and Mr. Bright found a school designed for students like them : Brooklyn High School for Leadership and Community Service in Clinton Hill which is operated by Brooklyn Community Services one of eight organizations supported by The New York Times Neediest Cases Fund . Leadership one of 57 transfer schools in New York City — established to help students struggling in traditional schools — has 202 students ages 16 to 21 . By the time students reach Leadership they have either dropped out of their regular schools or neared that point because of low grades or poor attendance . Many come from unstable homes living with single parents in shelters and temporary housing and have spent time in the criminal justice system . And 82 percent of the students qualify for free lunch because of their family ’s income . The flexible school schedule — which allows for free periods — enables students to concentrate on courses required to graduate . And the school provides an optional paid internship program which is appealing to students some of whom help support their families or who are legally emancipated and support themselves . Before Leadership Mr. Bright could not keep up with the demands at Boys and Girls High School . He struggled to pay attention in class and could not finish tests in time . Still he was not tested for a learning disability until he was enrolled at Leadership . Now he receives services at Leadership and extended time for tests and his grades have improved . At her previous school in Bushwick Ms. Vazquez purposefully broke the rules . She wore hats at school every day even though they were forbidden and each one was taken away . “ There was a point where I didn ’t have any of my hats ” she said . “ All 30 of my hats were locked in the dean ’s office . ” She enrolled at that school midway through her freshman year
" WASHINGTON — Russian warplanes have carried out airstrikes to support Turkey ’s offensive in northern Syria against the Islamic State an important evolution in a budding partnership . The deepening ties threaten to marginalize the United States in the struggle to shape Syria ’s ultimate fate . The air missions which took place for about a week near the strategically important town of Al Bab represent the Kremlin ’s first use of its military might to help the Turks in their fight against the militant group . The Russians seized an opening to try to build a military relationship with Turkey a NATO member as the United States has sought to keep the emphasis on taking Raqqa the Islamic State ’s capital . The Russian bombing is a remarkable turnabout from November 2015 when a Turkish fighter jet shot down a Russian attack plane that had violated Turkey ’s airspace . Russia and Turkey had already been involved in a joint effort to establish a in Syria — one that does not involve the United States . At the same time ties between the United States and Turkey have come under growing strain as the Turkish president Recep Tayyip Erdogan has become increasingly alarmed about the Kurdish forces known as the Y. P. G. The United States has aligned itself with those forces to combat the Islamic State in Syria . Some analysts say Russia appears to have arrived at an accommodation in which the Turks are moving to establish a security zone in northern Syria to preclude Syrian Kurds from setting up an autonomous region . In return the Turks appear to be backing off their efforts to unseat President Bashar of Syria who with Russian help is strengthening his hold on the country ’s major cities to the south . “ The rapprochement is largely tactical ” said James F. Jeffrey a former United States ambassador to Turkey . “ Russia can live for now with a Turkish enclave in northern Syria if it does not threaten the Assad regime . And it allows Russia to exploit the U. S. shift to Turkey ’s rival the Y. P. G. by providing air support to the Turks against the Islamic State which the U. S. inexplicably is not providing . ” Donald J. Trump has spoken positively though in vague terms about the possibility of cooperating with Russia in the fight against the Islamic State
1.0"Good morning . Here ’s what you need to know : • The stage is set for fierce battles starting tomorrow as the U. S. Senate begins confirmation hearings on Donald J. Trump ’s cabinet picks even though many have not completed customary background checks or ethics reviews . The first focus will be Senator Jeff Sessions above Mr. Trump ’s choice for attorney general . Boris Johnson the British foreign secretary is in the U. S. for talks with advisers of Mr. Trump and congressional leaders . In 2015 Mr. Johnson said that Mr. Trump displayed “ an ignorance that is truly alarming . ” _____ • “ Laughter of the year ! ” Russian politicians and commentators are ridiculing a U. S. intelligence report that outlines an elaborate plot ordered by President Vladimir V. Putin to alter the outcome of the 2016 presidential race . Interviews with supporters of Mr. Trump in two U. S. states found similarly dismissive opinions . Journalists are trying to come to terms with Moscow ’s ability to steer Western news coverage by doling out hacked documents . _____ • In Jerusalem a Palestinian driver plowed a truck into a group of Israeli soldiers killing four injuring 17 others and ending several months of relative calm in the city . Israel was shaken politically by a report that Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu negotiated for more positive coverage with Yediot Aharonot a newspaper that is often critical of the prime minister in exchange for curtailing its main competitor . And Israel ’s ambassador to Britain apologized over a recording of a senior diplomat plotting to “ take down ” senior British politicians . _____ • At the Golden Globes the musical “ La La Land ” dominated by winning a record seven awards . In drama categories “ Moonlight ” won best picture “ The Crown ” won best television show and Isabelle Huppert was named best actress for her performance in “ Elle . ” And Meryl Streep used her acceptance speech for a lifetime achievement award to forcefully criticize Mr. Trump . _____ • Two men who made history died : Mário Soares who guided Portugal ’s rocky transition to democracy in the 1970 s was 92 . Ayatollah Ali Akbar Hashemi Rafsanjani a founder of Iran ’s Islamic Republic was 82 . _____ • Freezing temperatures spread across most of Europe over the weekend
" At first blush there ’s a baffling quality to Julian Assange ’s latest star turn in our shambolic national story . He belongs in jail for “ waging his war ” against the United States by exposing its secrets the conservative Fox News host Sean Hannity has said of him . An “ operative with blood on his hands ” Sarah Palin once called him . Yet last week brought the sight of Mr. Hannity speaking with Mr. Assange in glowing terms about “ what drives him to expose government and media corruption ” through Clinton campaign hacks that American intelligence has attributed to Russia . And Ms. Palin hailed him as a great truth teller even apologizing for previous unpleasantries . ( Cue sound of needle sliding across record album . ) O. K. the fact that WikiLeaks ’ splash was bad for the Democrats and good for Donald J. Trump may have a bit to do with their change of heart . But what ’s up with Mr. Assange who seems equally comfortable being a hero of the American left as he is being one of the American right or even of Russian Putinists ? What does he want anyway ? The answer has been in front of us all along . And the current imbroglio over Russia WikiLeaks and their role in Mr. Trump ’s victory — or more to the point Hillary Clinton ’s loss — might be viewed as the realization of the vision Mr. Assange had when he started WikiLeaks over a decade ago . Mr. Assange spelled it out in prescient terms in an essay he posted online in November of 2006 the year of WikiLeaks ’ founding . He wrote it long before becoming the polarizing figure he is today a “ cypherpunk ” folk hero with an outsize reputation for being messianic impetuous and all too cavalier with the personal data that come his way . ( He ’s currently living in the Ecuadorean Embassy in London where he was granted asylum from Swedish authorities who are investigating a rape accusation against him that he says is false and politically motivated . ) Yet even his toughest critics acknowledge how clearly he saw the politically disruptive potential of technology back when some of us were getting our first BlackBerries . It ’s what prompted him to start WikiLeaks which “ pioneered something extremely important and very dangerous to large organizations that keep lots of secrets digitally ” as the journalist Glenn Greenwald told me in an interview last week . From the start Mr. Assange said WikiLeaks ’ prime directive was to expose hidden data sets that “ reveal illegal or immoral behavior ” in government and big business . But in the essay he also wrote in more ambitious terms about forcing regime change through data and technology rather than through the old
" Wealth and influence in the technology business have always been about gaining the upper hand in software or the machines that software ran on . Now data — gathered in those immense pools of information that are at the heart of everything from artificial intelligence to online shopping recommendations — is increasingly a focus of technology competition . And academics and some policy makers especially in Europe are considering whether big internet companies like Google and Facebook might use their data resources as a barrier to new entrants and innovation . In recent years Google Facebook Apple Amazon and Microsoft have all been targets of tax evasion privacy or antitrust investigations . But in the coming years who controls what data could be the next worldwide regulatory focus as governments strain to understand and sometimes rein in American tech giants . The European Commission and the British House of Lords both issued reports last year on digital “ platform ” companies that highlighted the essential role that data collection analysis and distribution play in creating and shaping markets . And the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development held a meeting in November to explore the subject “ Big Data : Bringing Competition Policy to the Digital Era . ” As government regulators dig into this new era of data competition they may find that standard antitrust arguments are not so easy to make . Using more and more data to improve a service for users and more accurately target ads for merchants is a clear benefit for example . And higher prices for consumers are not present with free internet services . “ You certainly don ’t want to punish companies because of what they might do ” said Annabelle Gawer a professor of the digital economy at the University of Surrey in England who made a presentation at the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development meeting . “ But you do need to be vigilant . It ’s clear that enormous power is in the hands of a few companies . ” Maurice Stucke a former Justice Department antitrust official and a professor at the University of Tennessee College of Law who also spoke at the gathering said one danger was that consumers might be afforded less privacy than they would choose in a more competitive market . The competition concerns echo those that gradually emerged in the 1990 s about software and Microsoft . The worry is that as the big internet companies attract more users and advertisers and gather more data a powerful “ network effect ” effectively prevents users and advertisers from moving away from a dominant digital platform
" As the dust settles on Russian interference in the United States election journalists are confronting an aspect that has received less scrutiny than the hacking itself but poses its own thorny questions : Moscow ’s ability to steer Western media coverage by doling out hacked documents . Reporters have always relied on sources who provide critical information for reasons . The duty tricky but familiar is to publicize information that serves the public interest without falling prey to the source ’s agenda . But in this case the source was Russia ’s military intelligence agency the G. R. U. — operating through shadowy fronts who worked to mask that fact — and its agenda was to undermine the American presidential election . By releasing documents that would tarnish Hillary Clinton and other American political figures but whose news value compelled coverage Moscow exploited the very openness that is the basis of a free press . Its tactics have evolved with each such operation some of which are still unfolding . Thomas Rid a professor of security studies at King ’s College London who is tracking the Russian influence campaign said it goes well beyond hacking : “ It ’s political engineering social engineering on a strategic level . ” Great powers have long meddled in one another ’s affairs . But Russia throughout 2016 developed a previously unseen tactic : setting up fronts to seed into the press documents it had obtained by hacking . “ Doing public relations work in order to get the hacked material out as an exclusive story with the Daily Caller or Gawker or the Smoking Gun that is new ” Mr. Rid said . That public relations work was initially done by two web presences that appeared this summer Guccifer 2. 0 and DCLeaks each posing as in the mold of Julian Assange the WikiLeaks chief . Though neither acknowledged it and the links were not immediately known online security experts later concluded that both were Russian fronts . Guccifer 2. 0 claimed to be a Romanian ”freedom fighter ” who had hacked the Democratic National Committee . Using Twitter ’s private message service
" COVINGTON La . — “ Sour grapes ” explained Bob Marino 79 weighing in on the recent spycraft bombshell from the corner table of a local McDonald’s . “ Sour grapes ” agreed Roger Noel 65 sitting next to him . “ Bunch of crybabies ” Reed Guidry 64 offered from across the table . The subject of conversation was the report released by United States intelligence chiefs on Friday informing Donald J. Trump of their unanimous conclusion that President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia ordered an extensive but covert cyberoperation to help Mr. Trump win the election . The Russians had hacked and leaked emails unleashed “ trolls ” on social media and used their “ propaganda machine ” to spread stories harmful to Hillary Clinton . In Washington the report was viewed as extraordinary both for its timing raising sharp questions about the ’s legitimacy on the verge of his taking office and for its assertions describing the operation as Russia ’s boldest effort yet to meddle with American elections to spread discontent and to “ undermine the U. S. democratic order . ” But interviews with Trump supporters here in Louisiana a state the won by 20 points
" MIAMI — By the time Donald Robertson a retired architect arrived at Fort International Airport ’s Terminal 1 on Friday afternoon the mass shooting in Terminal 2 which left five people dead had been over for at least an hour . The accused gunman Esteban Santiago was in police custody and the airport had largely returned to its normal rhythm — passengers were noshing charging their phones watching television . Things were so sedate that Mr. Robertson did not even realize there had been a shooting . But as he made his way past the gate Mr. Robertson looked up and saw a “ stampede ” of people including what looked like law enforcement agents racing toward him . “ It was tremendous ” he said . “ It was like a herd reacting . Everyone around me was diving under chairs . ” A rumor about a possible second gunman had spread across the airport via social media news sites and word of mouth . People panicked and the airport was shut down a turn of events that upended what had seemed like an orderly finale to a tragic afternoon . What followed that single rumor was a rush of terror for travelers and airport workers as they fled to the tarmac were separated from loved ones injured themselves in the tumult hid in kitchens and storage rooms and hunkered down behind luggage trucks . Chaos and uncertainty unfolded over the next 12 hours . Through it all
" Family members say that Esteban Santiago the suspect in the Fort Lauderdale airport shooting in which five people were killed seemed troubled when he came back from military service in Iraq . His brother described him as “ more furious ” after his deployment in 2010 with a Puerto Rico National Guard unit . His aunt said that after coming home Mr. Santiago “ lost his mind . ” After Mr. Santiago ’s arrest in the shooting emerging details of his military service led some to blame the rampage on the mind of a veteran haunted by stress disorder a common pattern when veterans are arrested in violent crimes . But experts not connected to Mr. Santiago ’s mental health treatment say it may be a mistake to blame PTSD . Mr. Santiago who served for eight years in the National Guard and Army Reserve and saw combat in Iraq in 2010 exhibited symptoms that do not appear to fit the disorder they say and more closely resemble schizophrenia a condition unrelated to military service . Mr. Santiago ’s family said he reported hearing voices and had other hallucinations but said he was never given a diagnosis of PTSD . In November he walked into an F. B. I. office in Alaska and told agents that his mind was being controlled by a United States intelligence agency . “ The delusions the hallucinations are far more consistent with psychosis than PTSD ” said Dr. Donald C. Goff a psychiatrist at New York University and a leading expert on schizophrenia . “ So is the timing of the onset . ” Mr. Santiago deployed to Iraq when he was 20 years old which is the age when many males with schizophrenia begin to exhibit symptoms Dr. Goff said cautioning that he could not comment on Mr. Santiago specifically without reviewing his medical records . “ Generally it ’s in the first year of college or military service or some other stressful event
" CHARLESTON S. C. — The federal trial to determine whether Dylann S. Roof will receive the death penalty for his murderous rampage at an church has become a delicate balancing act pitting the desire of prosecutors to convey the fullness of grief for the nine devout victims against the due process rights of an unrepentant white supremacist who largely declines to defend himself . In three days of testimony last week prosecutors questioned 20 spouses children grandchildren and friends of the victims to draw painfully poignant portraits of men and women who were pillars of their church families and community . Jurors heard not only the tributes of the bereaved but in some cases the voices of the dead — recordings of the Rev. Clementa C. Pinckney lecturing proudly about the history of Emanuel A. M. E. Church the Rev. DePayne Middleton Doctor booming a soulful a cappella solo the Rev. Sharonda praying in a crescendo at the funeral of a friend . The government ’s lawyers called two or three witnesses to render a portrait of each victim testimony about one of the deceased — the youngest Tywanza Sanders — remains for Monday . The prosecution plans to rest its case that day and Mr. Roof who is representing himself has said he will not call any witnesses . Closing arguments are expected on Tuesday . Mr. Roof 22 stared straight ahead or down at the defense table avoiding eye contact with witnesses who lost composure on the stand and jurors who sometimes dabbed away tears . When a prosecutor would conclude his gentle questioning which could draw on for more than an hour Judge Richard M. Gergel of Federal District Court would call for . Mr. Roof dressed in a sweater and slacks would rise slightly from his seat and announce : “ No questions . ” That dynamic has prompted a series of challenges by Mr. Roof
" • The record seven awards for the musical “ La La Land ” included for best picture comedy or musical and wins by Ryan Gosling and Emma Stone . “ Moonlight ” won for best picture drama . • Meryl Streep gave an impassioned politically charged speech after receiving the Cecil B. DeMille Award . • Casey Affleck Viola Davis Isabelle Huppert and Tracee Ellis Ross also won awards . Here is a list of the winners . • And in TV categories “ The Crown ” and “ Atlanta ” were triumphant . • Wesley Morris Melena Ryzik and Dave Itzkoff provided commentary . And The Times was also on the red carpet . The “ La La Land ” dominated the 74th Golden Globes on Sunday receiving a promotional boost in the form of a lavish tribute that kicked off the awards telecast and collecting a record seven prizes including one for best comedy or musical . No film has won more than four Globes since 1979 when the crime drama “ Midnight Express ” received six the previous number . “ I ’m in a daze now officially ” said the force behind “ La La Land ” Damien Chazelle 31 as he accepted the directing award . Noting the “ La La Land ” plot — dreamers try to make it in show business — Emma Stone said in accepting the award for best actress in a musical or comedy “ I think that hope and creativity are two of the most important things in the world and that ’s what this movie is about . ” “ La La Land ” made by Lionsgate also won Globes for song score screenplay and actor . The bliss felt by the “ La La Land ” cast and crew was likely mirrored by the disappointment of those involved with “ Moonlight ” the night ’s film . Despite six nominations
" Donald J. Trump dismissed Meryl Streep as “ a Hillary lover ” early Monday morning after the actress in a speech at the Golden Globes award ceremony denounced him as a bully who disrespected and humiliated others . Mr. Trump in a brief telephone interview said he had not seen Ms. Streep ’s remarks or other parts of the Globes ceremony which were broadcast on NBC but he added that he was “ not surprised ” that he had come under attack from “ liberal movie people . ” [ Read Meryl Streep ’s Golden Globes speech ] The Globes were the last Hollywood event before Mr. Trump ’s inauguration on Jan. 20 a transfer of power that many in the entertainment industry have bemoaned . While comments at the Globes were relatively restrained Ms. Streep one of the most outspoken progressives in the film world mounted a powerful critique of Mr. Trump ’s abilities as a performer complimenting in a backhanded way a style of showmanship that she all but called insidious . “ There was one performance this year that stunned me — it sank its hooks in my heart ” Ms. Streep said . “ Not because it was good there was nothing good about it . But it was effective and it did its job . It made its intended audience laugh and show their teeth . “ It was that moment when the person asking to sit in the most respected seat in our country imitated a disabled reporter ” she said referring to a speech by Mr. Trump in 2015 when he shuddered and flailed his arms seeming to mock a disabled reporter for The New York Times . “ It kind of broke my heart when I saw it and I still can ’t get it out of my head because it wasn ’t in a movie . It was real life . ” Mr. Trump as he has done many times before grew heated in the interview as he flatly denied that he had intended to make fun of the Times reporter
" Let ’s just be very clear about this : There is no movie called “ Hidden Fences . ” But you would be forgiven for thinking otherwise after watching the Golden Globes after the nonexistent movie was mentioned twice . The first time was definitely a mistake . The second time is not so clear . First NBC ’s Jenna Bush Hager taking her first turn at Golden Globes reporting presumably meant to ask Pharrell Williams about his best original score nomination for “ Hidden Figures ” a movie about three black women who would play crucial roles in the American space program . Surely she didn ’t mean to ask him about “ Fences ” a similarly renowned film starring Viola Davis and Denzel Washington . Mr. Williams had no involvement in that . But : Mr. Williams ’s reaction in which he appeared to be doing his best to hold back whatever he badly wished to say was impressive in its restraint . Unsurprisingly the immediate reaction on Twitter was less restrained . “ So Jenna Bush is just merging all of the black movies tonight at the #GoldenGlobes huh ? ” one user asked . “ Pharrell ’s face just held hundreds of years of whitewashing resolve ” another said . Others had fun in similarly inventing new movie titles . That seemed to be the end of things but for some reason Michael Keaton also referred to “ Hidden Fences ” when listing the nominees for best supporting actress in a motion picture . Since the camera was focused on the actresses it ’s unclear if Mr. Keaton said it with a wink and a nod . "
" We all know a new era dawns in Washington in approximately 12 days but why should Hollywood wait ? Kicking off the E ! red carpet show at the 74th Annual Golden Globes on Sunday night Ryan Seacrest served notice to all that as far as awards season goes change starts now . “ ‘ Who are you wearing ? ’ That ’s so done ” he said not long before admitting he was as it happened wearing a tuxedo from his Ryan Seacrest Distinction collection . Conflict of interest issues aside it was a provocative statement even in a time when practically every day brings a new provocative statement over the Twitter superhighway . Could it be true ? Would 2017 usher in a time when actresses ( and actors ) did not have to their clothes as part of the price of entry ? Dream on . The complex is alive and well and serving its prime purpose : marketing a moment of fantasy and escape . Kerry Washington did her job by not only introducing her dress as by Dolce Gabbana but by announcing that it was their special couture line and had never appeared on a red carpet before . Never in other words been seen by the general public ’s eyes . Sprinkle a little of that diamond dust on all of us . She wasn ’t the only one who could . Ruth Negga also modeled gold : this time sequins this time with a futuristic cool this time by Nicolas Ghesquière for Louis Vuitton . ( It never hurts to send a subliminal message by modeling yourself after a statuette perhaps the reason it was something of a trend . ) When Lily Collins appeared in full pink beaded Zuhair Murad her oversize bun like a nest just made for some twittering Disney canaries to land in it was clear as far as fashion went we were in well La La Land . There were trains on Winona Ryder ’s strapless black Viktor Rolf ball gown and Claire Foy ’s Titania dress . Pink was a dominant color

" About 25 years ago a conversation between me and one of the greatest biologists of the 20th century took a weird turn . I was talking to William D. Hamilton who was famous for coming up with the theory of “ kin selection ” which explains patterns of altruism among close relatives in various species including ours . This and other seminal ideas had earned Hamilton a place in the pantheon of thinkers who ushered in the modern Darwinian understanding of social behavior . Richard Dawkins in the preface to his landmark 1976 book“The Selfish Gene ” paid tribute to Hamilton and the three other “ dominant figures ” in social biology whose ideas formed the book ’s foundation . I was interviewing Hamilton at the University of Michigan where he was on sabbatical from Oxford . A video camera was rolling . I had been researching a book about evolutionary psychology and I was hoping to create a documentary on the subject . The documentary never materialized and Hamilton died in early 2000 . My interview with him sat unwatched until earlier this year when I tracked down the tape containing it . During the interview I was trying to steer Hamilton toward philosophical topics and at one point he went further than I had expected . He said “ I ’m also quite open to the view that there is some kind of ultimate good which is of a religious nature — that we just have to look beyond what the evolutionary theory tells us and accept promptings of what ultimate good is coming from some other source . ” That ’s an unusual thing for a great evolutionary biologist to say but the most unusual part was still to come . Hamilton continued in his British accent “ I could enlarge on that in terms of the possible existence of extraterrestrial manipulators who interfere and so on but I think this would be getting too far from the general topic of discussion . ” Well
" PITTSBURGH — The Miami Dolphins won the coin toss Sunday and kicked off to the Pittsburgh Steelers a decision that in retrospect seemed a tad misguided . But then it was not as if electing to receive would have been a wiser choice . A more prudent if somewhat unorthodox strategy would have been doing something else entirely with the football . Hiding it for example . Maybe beneath the Dolphins ’ parkas . Because without the ball the Steelers ’ offense could not score . And if the Steelers ’ offense could not score then the Dolphins might actually have stood a chance of winning Sunday ’s playoff game at Heinz Field instead of absorbing a comprehensive demolition . The defeat which reaffirmed Pittsburgh as a formidable A. F. C. contender held less suspense than a romantic comedy . All of 2 minutes 45 seconds elapsed before Pittsburgh scored on an exquisite ( 50 yards ) by Antonio Brown . That preceded another exquisite by Brown ( 62 yards ) which preceded a scoring rush by Le’Veon Bell who accounted for all 78 yards on that drive ( excluding a penalty ) all on runs 10 in a row . It was as if the Steelers kept giving him the ball because they had grown bored of demoralizing Miami through the air . Finishing with 167 yards Bell set the team postseason record in his playoff debut . He missed the playoffs two seasons ago with a hyperextended knee . Last year a torn knee ligament sidelined him . The Steelers have been eagerly waiting for their redoubtable trio of Bell Brown and quarterback Ben Roethlisberger who completed his first 11 passes for 188 yards to play in the postseason together . They combined for all four touchdowns scored across the first seven series ( one was a before halftime ) in a performance that showcased Pittsburgh at the apex of its intimidating might . “ We can attack in different ways ” Bell said . All of them are devastating . Especially those that involve Brown who turned two short passes into long touchdowns and Bell . Not since Barry Sanders perhaps
" TEHRAN — With the death of Ayatollah Ali Akbar Hashemi Rafsanjani on Sunday Iran ’s political factions knew immediately that any space by reformers to maneuver had just significantly decreased . Change had come and it did not favor those seeking to turn Iran into a less revolutionary country with more tolerance and outreach to the West — especially the United States . Mr. Rafsanjani a former president who helped found the Islamic republic had been the one man too large to be sidelined by conservative . Now he was suddenly gone dead from what state media described as cardiac arrest — and with no one influential enough to fill his shoes . Iran ’s reformists and moderates who would use Mr. Rafsanjani ’s regular calls for more personal freedoms and requests to establish better relations with the United States to advance their political agendas suddenly felt exposed and weakened . Who would now warn publicly against “ Islamic fascism ” when the sought to influence elections ? Who would state openly that there should be a nuclear compromise ? Mr. Rafsanjani said things others would not dare to say all agreed and his voice had at least created some tolerance for debates . “ will be happy but this is the start of a period of anxiety for many ” said Fazel Meybodi a cleric from the holy city Qum who supports reforms in Iran . “ His death disturbs the fragile balance we had in Iran . ” There simply are no replacements for Mr. Rafsanjani analysts from all factions say . His death also reflects the dwindling number of leaders from the generation that overthrew the shah nearly four decades ago . Most are now in their 80 s or even older . “ It is a very powerful reminder that Iran is at the beginning of a major leadership transition that will play a very psychological role in Iran ’s politics ” said Vali R. Nasr a Middle East scholar who is dean of the Johns Hopkins School of Advanced International Studies . “ I think this in some ways rattles Iran ’s political system in that it underscores the fact that with everything else going on — Syria the nuclear deal — there will be a passing of the baton to the next generation ” Mr. Nasr said . Two of Mr. Rafsanjani ’s most important protégés — Hassan Rouhani the current president
1.0"Ayatollah Ali Akbar Hashemi Rafsanjani a former president of Iran and a founder of the Islamic republic who navigated the opaque shoals of his country ’s theocracy as one of its most enduring wiliest and wealthiest leaders died on Sunday in Tehran . He was 82 . His death was announced by Iranian state television . As his career seesawed through periods of revolutionary zeal and confrontation with powerful conservative rivals he was portrayed as a Machiavellian and often ruthless player in the power struggles among Iran ’s elite factions protected by his close association with Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini the revolutionary leader who overthrew the shah in 1979 . Known as a pragmatist and centrist inclined toward economic liberalism and political authoritarianism Mr. Rafsanjani was accused by critics of corruption in amassing his fortune and of a readiness for harsh tactics to deal with dissent at home and abroad . Argentina has accused Mr. Rafsanjani and other senior Iranian figures of complicity in the 1994 bombing of a Jewish community center in Buenos Aires in which 85 people died . In 1997 a German court concluded that the highest levels of Iran ’s political leadership had ordered the killing five years earlier of four exiled Iranian Kurdish dissidents in Berlin . The events added weight to American assertions that Iran was a sponsor of terrorism . Mr. Rafsanjani was president from 1989 to 1997 . Yet many Western analysts believed that he sought a less confrontational relationship with the United States than other powerful figures in the Iranian hierarchy for whom hostility toward Washington was a touchstone of ideological purity . Mr. Rafsanjani for instance was credited with suggesting that “ Death to America ” be dropped from the litany of slogans at Tehran ’s Friday prayers a weekly moment of fervor in Iran ’s political and religious calendar . In the closing stages of the war which lasted from 1980 to 1988 Mr. Rafsanjani was appointed acting commander in chief of Iranian forces and was widely credited with persuading the leadership in Tehran to accept a United Nations resolution that ended the fighting . For much of his career he maintained roles in Parliament and on influential clerical panels under the tutelage of Ayatollah Khomeini and then
" They read like descriptions of props from the script of a Hollywood heist caper with promises to ward off “ attacks ” on all six sides from the usual suspects : hammer crowbar drill blowtorch nitroglycerin . That is the language of the brochures and websites of the city ’s safe dealers a small but longstanding industry that manages fears in and around the diamond district not only of disasters like fires or explosions but also of hypothetical supervillains . When a safe is breached word travels quickly . What happened ? Whose safe was it ? How did they get in ? Those were the sorts of questions raised last week after a team of burglars broke into a jeweler ’s office on West 36th Street on New Year ’s Eve . The crime was widely reported for its scope — the thieves made off with $ 6 million in diamonds and other gems — and its brazen timing occurring as the ball dropped six blocks away in a neighborhood teeming with police officers . Surveillance video showing two people hitting a door with hammers was taken immediately after midnight the police said when the sound of cheers would have most likely drowned out any banging . But what happened next is to many in the safe industry more important than the forced entry . The two safes that held the valuables the police said showed no sign of forced entry . The police have not provided further details on the safes . News reports have suggested investigators are looking into whether someone working for the dealer who provided the safes gave the thieves the combinations . A man answering the telephone at the office of the dealer Lacka Safe in New Jersey said on Friday that the owners declined to comment . As that investigation unfolds the burglary — or “ attack ” in security parlance — draws attention to the last line of defense for the city ’s many jewelers an object that
1.0"SEOUL South Korea — Less than a week after Donald J. Trump taunted North Korea over its ballistic missile capabilities North Korea has said that it could conduct its first test of an intercontinental missile “ anytime and anywhere ” in a rebuke to the incoming president . Although North Korea has vowed to develop the ability to attack the United States with nuclear warheads and has tested missiles that can reach throughout the Korean Peninsula and its vicinity it has never tested a missile that could fly over the Pacific . In a New Year ’s Day speech Kim North Korea ’s leader said his country had reached a “ final stage ” in preparing to test an intercontinental ballistic missile . That drew a Twitter post the next day from Mr. Trump that said “ It won ’t happen ! ” On Sunday an unidentified spokesman of the North Korean Foreign Ministry told the North ’s official Korean Central News Agency “ The ICBM will be launched anytime and anywhere determined by our supreme leadership . ” The spokesman ’s remarks made public on the KCNA website Monday were in response to comments last Thursday by Antony J. Blinken the United States deputy secretary of state that North Korea had made “ a qualitative improvement ” in its missile capabilities over the past year . And he said Washington and its allies would continue “ comprehensive sustained pressure and sanctions ” against the North . On NBC ’s “ Meet the Press ” on Sunday Ashton B. Carter the departing secretary of defense said the United States would shoot down a North Korean missile “ if it were coming towards our territory or the territory of our friends and allies . ” It remains unclear how close North Korea has come to building a reliable ICBM . Although it has displayed the believed to be its first ICBM during military parades in recent years it has never that system . In the past year
" The F. B. I. has arrested a Volkswagen executive in Florida accusing him of playing a central role in a broad conspiracy to keep United States regulators from discovering that diesel vehicles made by the company were programmed to cheat on emissions tests . The executive Oliver Schmidt a German who is the former top emissions compliance manager for Volkswagen in the United States was arrested on Saturday by investigators in Florida on a charge of conspiracy to defraud the United States . He is expected to be arraigned on Monday . The arrest of Mr. Schmidt is an escalation of the criminal investigation into emissions cheating by Volkswagen and comes amid talks between the company and the United States Justice Department about what penalties the carmaker should accept as part of a settlement . After a study by West Virginia University first raised questions over Volkswagen ’s diesel motors in early 2014 Mr. Schmidt played a central role in trying to convince regulators that excess emissions were caused by technical problems rather than by deliberate cheating Ian Dinsmore an F. B. I. agent said in a sworn affidavit used as the basis for Mr. Schmidt ’s arrest . Mr. Schmidt deceived American regulators “ by offering reasons for the discrepancy other than the fact that VW was intentionally cheating on U. S. emissions tests in order to allow VW to continue to sell diesel vehicles in the United States ” the affidavit said . Mr. Schmidt continued to represent Volkswagen after the company admitted in September that cars were programmed to dupe regulators . He appeared before a committee of the British Parliament in January telling legislators that Volkswagen ’s behavior was not illegal in Europe . Lawyers representing Mr. Schmidt did not respond to requests for comment late Sunday . Officials at the Justice Department also declined to comment as did an F. B. I. spokesman in Detroit . In a statement Jeannine Ginivan a spokeswoman for Volkswagen said that the automaker “ continues to cooperate with the Department of Justice ” but that “ it would not be appropriate to comment on any ongoing investigations or to discuss personnel matters . ” A Volkswagen spokesman in Germany also declined to comment . Lawsuits filed against Volkswagen by the New York and Massachusetts state attorneys general accused Mr. Schmidt of playing an important role in the carmaker ’s efforts to conceal its emissions cheating from United States regulators . In 2014 when California air quality officials began an investigation of Volkswagen emissions Mr. Schmidt was general manager of Volkswagen ’s Engineering and Environmental Office based in Auburn Hills Mich . For more than a year he and other Volkswagen officials repeatedly cited false technical explanations for the high emissions levels
" JERUSALEM — A Palestinian driver plowed a truck into a group of Israeli soldiers as they were getting off a bus in Jerusalem on Sunday afternoon killing four and injuring 17 others according to the police and witnesses . The police called the episode an act of terrorism . Micky Rosenfeld a police spokesman said the attacker had been shot and the police released images showing the truck ’s windshield riddled with bullet holes . The dead included three female soldiers and one male soldier the Israeli military confirmed . Several people were hospitalized some with critical injuries . Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu visited the scene of the attack and said the perpetrator was “ by all indications a supporter of the Islamic State . ” “ This is part of the same pattern inspired by Islamic State by ISIS that we saw first in France then in Germany and now in Jerusalem . This is part of the same ongoing battle against this global scourge of the new terrorism ” he added . Mr. Netanyahu has often made the comparison between local attacks against Israelis and those in the rest of the world though the attacks in Israel are more broadly viewed as being more connected to the conflict . While the Israeli security services have described a few Palestinian attackers as having been inspired by the ideology of the Islamic State no direct links have been established between them and the organization . The attack on Sunday occurred on the Armon Hanatziv Promenade a popular tourist spot between East Jerusalem and West Jerusalem that offers sweeping views of the Old City . The four soldiers killed were Erez Orbach 20 from Alon Shvut in the West Bank Yael Yekutiel 20 from Givatayim near Tel Aviv Shir Hajaja
" LOS ANGELES — It was a surprise photo finish at the weekend box office with the drama “ Hidden Figures ” and “ Rogue One : A Star Wars Story ” each selling an estimated $ 22 million in tickets at North American theaters . Most analysts had expected “ Rogue One ” ( Disney ) to easily repeat as the No. 1 multiplex attraction . The “ Star Wars ” spinoff has now collected about $ 477 . 3 million over four weeks . Overseas it has taken in another $ 437 million . But in its first weekend in wide release “ Hidden Figures ” ( 20th Century Fox ) about unsung black heroines in the NASA space race of the 1960 s was lifted by strong reviews an aggressive marketing campaign that included a appeal to faith audiences and attention on Hollywood ’s annual awards circuit . Fox said “ Hidden Figures ” directed by Theodore Melfi and starring Octavia Spencer Taraji P. Henson and Janelle Monáe did particularly well in San Francisco Washington Chicago and Cleveland . Produced by Chernin Entertainment and Levantine Films for about $ 25 million after accounting for tax credits “ Hidden Figures ” received an grade from ticket buyers in CinemaScore exit polls . The movie was most popular with women ( 64 percent of the audience ) and people over the age of 35 ( about 56 percent of attendees ) . The animated musical “ Sing ” ( Universal ) was next in line taking in about $ 20 million for a domestic total of $ 213 . 4 million . The weekend ’s other new movie “ Underworld : Blood Wars ” ( Sony ) only managed $ 13 million in ticket sales or nearly 50 percent less than the initial results for its 2012 franchise predecessor . Sony noted that “ Blood Wars ” also cost half as much to make — about $ 35 million — and has already taken in $ 45 million overseas . Sony also blamed winter storms in the Eastern United States for decreasing turnout . Among specialty releases : “ Manchester by the Sea ” ( Roadside Attractions ) sold about $ 2. 5 million in tickets in 1054 theaters lifting its total to $ 34 million “ Patriots Day ” ( CBS Films and Lionsgate ) about the 2013 Boston Marathon bombing had $ 105 000 in seven locations
" LONDON — In a deeply embarrassing episode revealed on Sunday a senior employee of the Israeli Embassy in Britain was recorded plotting to “ take down ” senior British politicians critical of Israel and calling Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson “ an idiot ” who “ has become minister of foreign affairs without any responsibilities . ” The Israeli ambassador Mark Regev offered a formal apology on Friday according to a statement from the Israeli Embassy . The embassy also said that the employee Shai Masot who described himself as a former major in the Israeli Army now working as a political officer would soon leave his job . Mr. Masot made the comment in October in footage filmed in a London restaurant and obtained by the newspaper The Mail on Sunday . The recording was made by an Al Jazeera reporter acting undercover who called himself Robin and who described himself as working for a political group called Labour Friends of Israel which rejected any connection to him . The conversation involved Mr. Masot and Maria Strizzolo an aide to Robert Halfon an education minister and former political director of Conservative Friends of Israel . Mr. Masot was particularly eager to target Alan Duncan a minister in the Foreign Office who has been critical of Israel and its settlements in occupied Palestinian territory a sensitive issue in British politics . Mr. Duncan he said “ is causing a lot of problems . ” In the footage Mr. Masot asked Ms. Strizzolo “ Can I give you some M. P. s that I would suggest you would take down ? ” he asked . He went on to say that she knew which M. P. s — members of Parliament — he was referring to . She asked him to remind her . “ The deputy foreign minister ” he said referring to Mr. Duncan . She said
1.0"SEATTLE — For a technology to crack the mainstream there is an unspoken understanding : It shouldn ’t make the people who use it want to throw up . And yet there was a reminder at last week ’s International CES trade show in Las Vegas of how far virtual reality has to go until everyone is ready to fasten goggles to their faces . At a news conference Intel the chip maker provided virtual reality headsets to about 250 attendees so they could watch a video from the perspective of sky divers hurtling out of a helicopter in wingsuits . Intel also passed out motion sickness bags to everyone in case anybody felt inclined to vomit an unfortunate side effect of turbulent virtual reality experiences for some people . Laura Anderson an Intel spokeswoman said the company had provided the bags “ out of an abundance of caution and to be tongue in cheek about our immersive experience . ” No one used the bags she said . It is time for a reality check for virtual reality one of the most hyped technologies of last year . Sales of the most capable headsets have been sluggish by most estimates held back by high costs a lack of content and the complexity and awkwardness of the products . Less expensive mobile headsets that use smartphones as their screens are selling better but are far more limited in what they can do . Many technologists and early adopters of virtual reality remain unchanged in their conviction that the technology will eventually change how entertainment including games and movies is experienced by the masses . The major virtual reality headsets from Oculus
" Queen Elizabeth II made her first public appearance in almost a month on Sunday allaying concerns about her health after she missed Christmas and New Year ’s Day church services because of what Buckingham Palace described as a persistent cold . The queen who will turn 91 in April attended services at St. Mary Magdalene Church in Sandringham England with Prince William the Duke of Cambridge and his wife as well as several members of the Duchess of Cambridge ’s family including her sister Pippa and brother James . Before Sunday the queen whose appearances are usually a staple of the holiday season had not been seen in public since Dec. 9. Her absence on Christmas Day was the first time in 30 years that she had not attended the holiday service . on social media celebrated the queen ’s reappearance . “ The Queen has been seen in public ” one Twitter user said . “ Huge relief . I can sleep easy in my bed now . ” The queen ’s came several weeks after a widespread Twitter hoax started by a fake BBC account that convinced many of her fans that she had died . Despite feeling under the weather the queen managed to record her traditional Christmas broadcast . “ The message of Christmas reminds us that inspiration is a gift to be given as well as received and that love begins small but always grows ” she said then . “ I wish you all a very happy Christmas . ” "
" Just hours before what would have been his 70th birthday David Bowie resurfaced . A new video for one of Mr. Bowie ’s final songs and a brief EP of previously released tracks were made available late on Saturday almost exactly a year since the release of the musician ’s final album “ Blackstar ” and days before the first anniversary of his death on Jan. 10 . The video for the song “ No Plan ” was directed by Tom Hingston who also worked with Mr. Bowie on videos for the songs “ I ’d Rather Be High ( Venetian Mix ) ” and “ Sue ( Or in a Season of Crime ) . ” The clip features a ghostly row of television screens flashing the lyrics of Mr. Bowie ’s song which explores themes of disembodiment and confusion . Above the screens is a sign for Newton Electrical a reference to Thomas Jerome Newton Mr. Bowie ’s character in the film “ The Man Who Fell to Earth . ” That character was resurrected as the protagonist of “ Lazarus ” a musical featuring Mr. Bowie ’s songs that began its run in late 2015 . All of the songs on the new EP were featured on the “ Lazarus ” cast recording released this fall . The EP also called “ No Plan ” includes “ Lazarus ” from “ Blackstar ” as well as “ No Plan ” “ Killing a Little Time ” and “ When I Met You . ” The four songs all of which were recorded during sessions for “ Blackstar ” are Mr. Bowie ’s final studio recordings . Mr. Bowie recorded “ Blackstar ” with the Donny McCaslin Quartet a jazz combo he had scouted in Greenwich Village from January to March 2014 at the Magic Shop in SoHo .

" Hillary Clinton who has kept a relatively low public profile since losing the presidential election two months ago on Sunday showed up at the final performance of the Broadway revival of “ The Color Purple ” reveling in the story of a beleaguered woman who triumphs over the oppressive men in her life ( and along the way discovers a love for colorful pants ) . Mrs. Clinton accompanied by her husband former President Bill Clinton and their daughter Chelsea received several ovations from the audience as she arrived and then another round of applause when she was acknowledged by the cast after the show . “ There ’s a lot of really awesome famous and notable people here today ” the actress Patrice Covington who gave the farewell speech on behalf of the cast after the show said to the audience . “ I ’m not going to call all of them out — I know you already know them ” she said before pausing looking in Mrs. Clinton ’s direction and waving at her mischievously . At that the audience erupted into a new loud round of applause . The reaction was substantially warmer than the scattered booing and clapping that greeted the arrival of Vice Mike Pence when he attended “ Hamilton
" DUBLIN — An assembly of Irish citizens convened by Parliament is considering changes to one of the most divisive policies in the country : the ban on abortions which has been enshrined in Ireland ’s Constitution since 1983 . The group a Citizens ’ Assembly led by Mary Laffoy a Supreme Court judge does not have the power to change the law . But its mandate from Parliament — to examine the full range of medical legal and ethical issues surrounding abortion — suggests a willingness to revisit the ban one of the most stringent in the Western world . Over the last three months the assembly has received more than 13500 comments from the public — more than 1000 of which have been published online so far . It pored over these submissions at the Grand Hotel Malahide over the weekend along with testimony from experts and is scheduled to issue a report later this year . Abortion was already illegal in Ireland before 1983 but the Eighth Amendment gave “ the right to life of the unborn ” equal status to “ the right to life of the mother ” under the Constitution . The amendment was enacted through a voter referendum and can be altered — or abandoned — only via another referendum . Several highly publicized cases since then have contributed to and reflected a shift in the public ’s mood however . In 2012 a woman Savita Halappanavar died from septic shock while having a miscarriage after a hospital denied her an abortion that might have saved her life . And last year a United Nations committee ruled that Ireland had violated a woman ’s rights by forcing her to travel abroad for an abortion even though severe congenital defects had been diagnosed in the fetus . Legal uncertainty over how to define “ the unborn ” has long dogged the amendment and the assembly was seen as one response to the panel ’s criticisms . It is common for women in Ireland to travel to countries such as Britain and the Netherlands for abortions . Figures from Britain ’s National Health Service showed that more than 3
" In an effort to give back to his hometown community in Florida Carol City the star Rick Ross decided to fulfill a childhood dream : He bought a Checkers franchise . Why a Checkers ? One reason seemed to rise above them all . “ The No. 1 fries in the game ” Mr. Ross says in a video released in December . The video shows Mr. Ross driving around town in his Ford truck puffing cigars and relating stories from his childhood in the downtrodden community which is in the Miami area . At a certain point Mr. Ross begins talking about the burger joint he frequented as a teenager across the thoroughfare from the carwash where he worked . There was a McDonald ’s that was closer but Checkers he says was more affordable . “ I made $ 30 a day from 8 in the morning to 8 at night ” Mr. Ross says . “ I went to Checkers . ” Checkers does not typically pursue celebrity endorsements . But when Mr. Ross applied to purchase the Carol City franchise last summer he seemed so genuine in his affection for the chain that Checkers recognized a marketing opportunity as straightforward as a . Still it did not want a typical campaign . Scott Wakeman director of marketing for Checkers Restaurants Inc . and the company ’s ad firm Fitzgerald Company in Atlanta turned to the digital media upstart Woven Digital . The firm has heavy traction among Mr. Ross ’s primary audience — young men — on the entertainment sites that it owns like Uproxx Dime and BroBible . Woven has also specialized in productions that on the surface do not feel like ads . To Mr. Wakeman
" On an overcast Friday morning last January longshoremen all over New York Harbor walked off the docks bringing the port nearly to a stop for a day . What were the longshoremen ’s grievances ? What were their demands ? Many of the men seemed not to know . They hung around the food trucks and milled about the parking lots unsure why they had stopped working and unsure what it would take for work to resume . “ No one knew what that was about ” one recalled recently . A year later the reason for the strike remains unclear even as the agency tasked with ridding the waterfront of organized crime the Waterfront Commission has questioned dozens of longshoremen under oath . One told the commission he learned of the strike early that morning when it was too dark to see the face of the man giving the order . It could have been anyone . It was the old D D — Deaf and Dumb the classic longshoreman ’s response popularized in the 1954 film “ On the Waterfront . ” In that movie the longshoremen were reluctant even frightened to talk to the authorities whether a priest or a detective because the mob controlled the waterfront . In the years since much has changed around New York Harbor the heavy lifting is done not by hand but by cranes and human voices are scarcely heard amid the beeping of the straddle carriers giant insectlike machines that move containers back and forth . But even as New York and New Jersey ’s increasingly valuable shoreline is claimed by luxury development
" Times Insider delivers insights into life at The New York Times . In a large newsroom the collaboration between a reporter and a photographer often depends on the whims of their respective assigning editors who calculate strengths weaknesses and most of all availability . Who ’s up to cover that fire ? Who ’s up to shoot it ? The resulting slapdash teamwork between writer and photographer can end as quickly as it began they may work together the next day or never again . But for many years now I have been fortunate to work with exceptional New York Times photographers for extended periods of time while writing a national column called “ This Land . ” Lately I have been collaborating with Todd Heisler a stunningly gifted photographer and a great companion . Before Todd I traveled for several years beside the recently retired Nicole Bengiveno whose profound empathy comes through in her camera ’s every click and who deserves some formal commendation for having put up with a certain hack — me — for so long . And before Nicole there was Ángel Franco who retired last month to end a storied Times career — and who began the “ This Land ” column with me 10 years ago this month . The template for our relationship — indeed for “ This Land ” — was established in early 2007 as we headed out to do our inaugural column one on Logan a small West Virginia city struggling with a fatal mine disaster and the decline of King Coal . Mr. Franco and I began by walking the streets noticing : the coal train running through the city ’s core the dust settling on buildings along the tracks and the Jesus Christ carved from anthracite
" As is so often the case the party doesn ’t really get going until everybody is good and drunk . Then after much wine vodka and awkward conversation comes a fabulous eruption of runaway hedonism . Maybe you think coming to this shindig wasn ’t such a bad idea after all . You ’ve known such moments surely when the spectacle of people going stark raving wild carries its own irresistible anarchic logic . A feeling of vital connection saturates the room like the fizz from an exploded bottle of Champagne . Alas the thrill is a lonely cascade of fireworks in a night of damp squibs . And the briefly beautifully animated revelers go back to being their soggy miserable selves . That ’s what happens — in terms of both plot and performance — toward the end of the first half of “ The Present ” the Sydney Theater Company ’s sprawling and confused adaptation of a sprawling and confused play written by a young Anton Chekhov . This fitful Australian import which opened on Sunday night at the Barrymore Theater chronicles the bad behavior at one birthday celebration .

" He was not her type . He was too old for her . She would never give him her number . And then she did . And he called her . And they fell in love . He called three times a day for a week before she finally answered . Alena Kastsiuk picked up the phone that May morning in 2011 only to yell at him for waking her . “ How about sushi ? ” he responded . Ms. Kastsiuk a waitress who had worked other jobs had little money for such luxuries . Her refrigerator was empty so she agreed . The sushi date lasted five and a half hours . Although he was almost twice her age Ms. Kastsiuk a film directing major from Belarus struggling to find her way into New York ’s film industry discovered much in common with the Russian pianist across from her . The pianist Vladimir Spitsberg had arrived in New York State more than 20 years earlier worked as a digital media arts instructor at Touro College in Manhattan and played with his band Gypsy Fun Trio at a Russian restaurant and piano bar in Midtown Manhattan . “ I fell in love that day ” said Ms. Kastsiuk now 29 . “ And I didn ’t even understand love yet . ” They married three weeks later . “ Maybe three and a half weeks ” she said . It was not a marriage of convenience . Neither was a United States citizen . They married for love but the ceremony was a nightmare . On what was supposed to be her wedding day Ms. Kastsiuk discovered that the security tag was still attached to her dress . Mr. Spitsberg pulled at it and yellow paint exploded on her gown . She changed into a sundress and they hurtled to the Brooklyn clerk ’s office with 30 minutes to spare before it closed . But they forgot their rings and had to turn back to retrieve them . They made it back to the clerk ’s office just after it closed .

2017.01.0"On the night of Nov. 16 a group of executives gathered in a private dining room of the restaurant La Chine at the Waldorf Astoria hotel in Midtown Manhattan . The table was laden with Chinese delicacies and $ 2 100 bottles of Château Lafite Rothschild . At one end sat Wu Xiaohui the chairman of the Waldorf ’s owner Anbang Insurance Group a Chinese financial behemoth with estimated assets of $ 285 billion and an ownership structure shrouded in mystery . Close by sat Jared Kushner a major New York real estate investor whose Donald J. Trump had just been elected president of the United States . It was a mutually auspicious moment . Mr. Wu and Mr. Kushner — who is married to Mr. Trump ’s daughter Ivanka and is one of his closest advisers — were nearing agreement on a joint venture in Manhattan : the redevelopment of 666 Fifth Avenue the fading crown jewel of the Kushner family empire . Anbang which has close ties to the Chinese state has seen its aggressive efforts to buy up hotels in the United States slowed amid concerns raised by Obama administration officials who review foreign investments for national security risk . Now according to two people with knowledge of the Mr. Wu toasted Mr. Trump and declared his desire to meet the whose ascension he was sure would be good for global business . Since the election intense scrutiny has been trained on Mr. Trump ’s company and the potential conflicts of interest he will face . But with Mr. Kushner laying the groundwork for his own White House role the meeting at the Waldorf shines a light on his family ’s business Kushner Companies and on the ethical thicket he would have to navigate while advising his on policy that could affect his bottom line .

" WASHINGTON — The speed of Republican efforts to repeal the Affordable Care Act has stunned health industry lobbyists leaving representatives of insurance companies hospitals doctors and pharmaceutical makers in disarray and struggling for a response to a legislative quick strike that would upend much of the American health care system . The Senate is expected to take the first step by Thursday morning approving parliamentary language in a budget resolution that would a repeal bill that could not be filibustered in the Senate . House and Senate committees would have until Jan. 27 to report out repeal legislation . Health insurance and health care for millions of Americans are at risk . But far from reflecting the magnitude of the moment the most prominent message from lobbyists that lawmakers saw in their first week back at work was a narrowly focused advertisement from the U. S. Chamber of Commerce demanding the repeal of “ Obamacare taxes ” especially an annual fee imposed on health insurance companies to help pay for the expansion of coverage under the health law . “ More than 20 million people could lose their health insurance and states could lose billions of dollars in Medicaid money ” said Kenneth E. Raske the president of the Greater New York Hospital Association . But he added many health care executives “ don ’t want to get on the wrong side of the new administration or the Republican majority in Congress . ” Health care professionals are not totally silent but industries that were integral to the creation of the Affordable Care Act in 2010 are keeping their voices down as Republicans rush to dismantle it . Some Republican lawmakers are openly fretting about their leaders ’ repeal strategy saying they must develop an Affordable Care Act replacement before they repeal it . Five Republican senators proposed on Monday to extend the deadline for drafting repeal legislation by five weeks until March 3. One of the five Senator Bob Corker of Tennessee said the extra time would allow Congress and the Trump administration to “ get the policy right ” as they try to arrange a smooth transition to a new system of health coverage . But the naysayers are getting no cover from a major lobbying and advertisement blitz like the ones that blanketed the airwaves in 2009 and 2010 . To block the repeal effort said Senator Richard J. Durbin of Illinois the No. 2 Senate Democrat “ we need two or three Republicans to join us . ” Doctors are telling Congress to proceed with caution insisting that no one should lose coverage .

" Many thousands of women are expected to converge on the nation ’s capital for the Women ’s March on Washington the day after Donald J. Trump ’s inauguration . Jennifer Willis no longer plans to be one of them . Ms. Willis a wedding minister from South Carolina had looked forward to taking her daughters to the march . Then she read a post on the Facebook page for the march that made her feel unwelcome because she is white . The post written by a black activist from Brooklyn who is a march volunteer advised “ white allies ” to listen more and talk less . It also chided those who it said were only now waking up to racism because of the election . “ You don ’t just get to join because now you ’re scared too ” read the post . “ I was born scared . ” Stung by the tone Ms. Willis canceled her trip . “ This is a women ’s march ” she said . “ We ’re supposed to be allies in equal pay marriage adoption . Why is it now about ‘ White women don ’t understand black women ’ ? ” If all goes as planned the Jan. 21 march will be a momentous display of unity in protest of a president whose treatment of women came to dominate the campaign ’s final weeks . But long before the first buses roll to Washington and sister demonstrations take place in other cities contentious conversations about race have erupted nearly every day among marchers exhilarating some and alienating others . In Tennessee emotions ran high when organizers changed the name of the local march from “ Women ’s March on ” to “ Power Together Tennessee in solidarity with Women ’s March on Washington . ” While many applauded the name change which was meant to signal the start of a new social justice movement in Nashville some complained that the event had turned from a march for all women into a march for black women .

The DeVoses a dominant force in Michigan politics for decades with a fortune in the billions had contributed to one of Mr. Casperson ’s earlier campaigns . But a week before his primary family members sent $ 24 000 to one of his opponents then poured $ 125 000 into a “ super PAC ” Concerned Taxpayers of America that ran ads attacking him .

" The morning rush at the Jewish community center in Columbia S. C. had subsided when the phone rang on Monday . The caller an woman “ in a loud screaming voice kept saying there ’s a bomb ” said Barry A. Abels the center ’s executive director . At roughly the same time a woman dialed the Jewish community center in Rockville Md . nearly 500 miles away and said there was a bomb . Not long after a man called a Jewish organization in Wilmington Del . He too warned of a bomb . Similar threats which turned out to be unfounded were reported all over the Eastern United States on Monday at as many as 16 Jewish community facilities one advocacy group estimated . Time and time again the police responded buildings were evacuated and after tense waits the centers and schools reopened . Federal law enforcement officials did not definitively link the threats
" WASHINGTON — In a vivid illustration of the tensions between the United States and Iran an American Navy warship fired warning shots at Iranian boats that were racing toward it near the Strait of Hormuz Defense Department officials said on Monday . The episode occurred Sunday when four Iranian fast boats came within 900 yards of the U. S. S. Mahan a guided missile destroyer that was escorting an amphibious warship with 1000 Marines on board and a Navy oiler . When the Iranian boats did not respond to a radio call and flares signaling them to stop the American destroyer fired three warning shots with a . machine gun . A Navy helicopter also dropped smoke grenades . There was no damage to the Iranian vessels and they did not return fire . It was the first time the Navy had fired warning shots at an Iranian boat since Aug. 24 . Though the boats ’ approaches are essentially a form of harassment they point to the risk of military confrontation in a region that is bristling with Western Arab and Iranian forces . Donald J. Trump vowed during the presidential campaign to take military action against Iranian ships that approached American vessels in a threatening manner . “ With Iran when they circle our beautiful destroyers with their little boats and they make gestures at our people that they shouldn ’t be allowed to make they will be shot out of the water ” Mr. Trump said at a rally in September . There were 35 close encounters between American and Iranian vessels in 2016 most of which occurred during the first half of the year and 23 encounters in 2015 . “ We had a significant number of these before ” Capt. Jeff Davis a Pentagon spokesman told reporters . “ They had largely stopped . ” The most serious episode took place in January 2016 when Iran detained and ultimately freed 10 sailors who had unintentionally entered its territorial waters while cruising from Kuwait to Bahrain . On Sunday Iranian boats approached the American ships six times before they got so close that the Mahan fired warning shots . “ This was an unsafe and unprofessional interaction and that is due to the fact that they were approaching at a high level of speed with weapons manned
" Delivering the first of six State of the State addresses planned around the state this week Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo on Monday located the cure to the nation ’s political fever in New York State implicitly offering himself as an antidote to a whose name went unmentioned . “ New York knows that our progressive principles of acceptance and diversity are not the enemy of our middle class and we know that success is not the enemy of our progressive beliefs ” he said . “ In fact it was the progressive policies that created the nation ’s middle class in the first place . ” Ahead of his scheduled stops in western and central New York on Long Island in Westchester County and in Albany Mr. Cuomo ’s remarks in a room at 1 World Trade Center colored largely within state lines . But remarkably for a politician who has avoided even the appearance of White House ambitions since entering the governor ’s mansion in 2011 his speech also seemed aimed at an audience outside New York . Mr. Cuomo reiterated his promise to upgrade Queens ’s two major airports but he dwelled far longer on the reality on Queens ’s streets . There he said the economic recovery trumpeted by the Obama administration had somehow never gotten around to the Hillside Avenue gas station where he worked as a teenager or the “ pizzeria where we hung out . ” “ It is not what they feel ” he said referring to the white voters who proved so receptive to Donald J. Trump ’s candidacy . “ It is not their reality . ” Lines drawn from the Elizabeth Warren syllabus got the Cuomo treatment ( at one point he noted that the Wall Street executives who presided over the financial crisis were never punished ) . One of Mr. Cuomo ’s chief proposals on Monday was a “ recovery act ” that he said would provide jobs and erect infrastructure expand access to education and lower taxes . Lest anybody miss the point the governor ’s staff circulated “ key takeaways ” and quotations from the speech billing the address as a groundbreaking blueprint for moving forward in the Trump era . There were ’ proposals covering what seemed like the whole spectrum of liberal causes . Doubling the tax credit for more than 200000 families . Executive orders intended to reduce a wage gap for women working for the state . Criminal justice reforms affecting the state ’s bail system
" WASHINGTON — The Obama administration has blacklisted five Russians including the government ’s chief public investigator who is a close aide to President Vladimir V. Putin for human rights abuses laying down a marker for Donald J. Trump less than two weeks before he takes office with a vow to thaw relations with Russia . The sanctions announced Monday by the Treasury Department are not related to allegations of Russian hacking during the presidential election according to a senior administration official . But they carry symbolic weight at a charged moment as likely the last visible act the United States will take against Russia before power is transferred in Washington . The biggest name added to the list is that of Aleksandr I. Bastrykin who reports directly to Mr. Putin and has carried out political investigations on his behalf . Mr. Bastrykin officials said was complicit in the case of Sergei L. Magnitsky a lawyer who died in detention in murky circumstances in November 2009 and for whom the Magnitsky Act was named . Under that 2012 law passed by Congress with Democratic and Republican support the Treasury and Justice Departments must investigate and penalize Russian individuals involved in that case and subsequent or in other human rights abuses . The Obama administration has now put 44 people on the list . The sanctions announced Monday include a ban on travel to the United States and a freezing of any assets held by or transactions with American financial institutions . The White House has enforced the law with varying degrees of enthusiasm depending on relations between the United States and Russia . In late 2013 human rights activists said it delayed releasing the list because it worried that the move — coming just before the Winter Olympic Games in Sochi Russia — would further curdle relations . But the administration ’s final list particularly with the inclusion of Mr. Bastrykin
" Clemson upset Alabama and won the college football national championship in Tampa early Tuesday morning . Clemson was led by its star quarterback Deshaun Watson who threw for 420 yards despite facing a defense heralded as one of the best ever . With two minutes left trailing by 3 points Watson got the ball at his own 32 and started a drive . Nine plays and 68 yards later with 1 second on the clock Hunter Renfrow caught a touchdown to win the game . The drive included six completed passes notably a to Watson ’s favorite target Mike Williams and a goal line pass interference call . “ I ’m speechless right now man ” Watson said after the game . “ We worked so hard for it we fell short last year . This game is not just for me it ’s for all the alumni the fans my family in Gainesville . ” It was the second big title game in a row for Watson who threw for 405 yards in a loss in this game against Alabama last season . He is likely to go in the top 5 of the N. F. L. draft this year . Watson ’s Achilles ’ heel during the regular season was the interception but he threw none in this game . Alabama for its part kept the ball mostly on the ground . Its freshman quarterback Jalen Hurts was for only 131 yards . Alabama had raced to a lead on two touchdowns by Bo Scarbrough . Watson cut the lead to with a long drive that ended with his touchdown run . A game that started as a defensive struggle opened up in the second half . More Watson passing pulled Clemson to within on a touchdown to Renfrow . Hurts finally broke through with a touchdown to a O. J. Howard making it Alabama . Another long Clemson drive concluded with a pass from Watson to Williams and Clemson was back within 3 . Clemson seized its first lead in the game as Wayne Gallman punched in a touchdown run . The key play in the drive was a pass to Williams
" JERUSALEM — One loved horse riding another was the oldest of four sisters a third had fought to enlist in the army despite medical problems that allowed him to defer the draft . The fourth was the 300th graduate of her Haifa high school to have died while serving as a soldier . Israel buried its latest terrorism victims on Monday the day after they were run down by a Palestinian man in a truck enveloping them in the country ’s familiar outpouring of love for its service members . But this time the usually unifying ritual was marred by discord . Israelis called it the “ Azaria effect ” referring to Sgt. Elor Azaria the soldier who was convicted last week of manslaughter for shooting a wounded and incapacitated Palestinian assailant in the head . Video from the scene of Sunday ’s attack showed dozens of armed soldiers fleeing from the truck instead of trying to shoot the driver . Some Israelis who had complained that the army ’s high command failed to back up Sergeant Azaria asserted that the soldiers had fallen short because they were afraid of being put on trial . The military security experts and soldiers at the scene quickly rejected that notion . “ Those who ran from the scene were not concerned about Azaria but about their own ” said Yehuda Ben Meir an expert in national security and public opinion at the Institute for National Security Studies at Tel Aviv University . Still the argument — unfolding in full volume on Israeli news sites social media and broadcast channels — reflected the disruptive influence the Azaria affair has had on the army and its central place in Israeli society . In this small country where most Jewish are drafted into years of service the military has long been a rare reserve of respect and consensus . Yet the same sentiment that leads Israeli Jews to treat soldiers as “ everybody ’s children ” has also led many to call for a pardon for Sergeant Azaria creating tension between the people and the commanders of their army . “ The motherly protection of soldiers sometimes overcomes your basic value system ” Mr. Ben Meir said adding that the instinct to protect soldiers was not particular to Israel . The soldiers targeted by the Palestinian truck driver on Sunday were in officer training programs and most were not preparing for combat roles . Many were in the educational corps or training for administrative jobs on the home front . On a routine educational tour of Jerusalem they were caught as they disembarked from buses at a popular observation spot with panoramic views of Old City . The truck driver plowed into one group then reversed and came back to claim more victims . A tour guide who shot at the truck with his pistol complained on television that the soldiers were better equipped with but had hesitated to shoot . Noam Kedar one of the soldiers at the scene
" When F. B. I. agents learned that a prime suspect in the Volkswagen emissions scandal was traveling to the United States investigators knew they were on the cusp of a rare feat : the arrest of an overseas corporate executive accused of wrongdoing . On Saturday night agents swooped in to arrest the Volkswagen executive Oliver Schmidt as he prepared to depart Miami International Airport for Germany according to two law enforcement officials familiar with the case one of whom described the circumstances of the arrest . The officials spoke on the condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to speak publicly about the case . Mr. Schmidt formerly Volkswagen ’s top emissions compliance executive in the United States has been charged with defrauding the government and violating the Clean Air Act . He made an initial appearance on Monday in federal court in Miami . He will be moved to Detroit where he was originally charged and where court documents suggest that he might be valuable in the government ’s investigation into other Volkswagen officials . Mr. Schmidt 48 played a central role in Volkswagen ’s of its diesel emissions cheating according to an affidavit from an F. B. I. agent that was unsealed on Monday . Even as the company obfuscated details of its cheating program from regulators Mr. Schmidt warned executives in Germany that the company could face criminal charges for its actions the affidavit says . The case against Mr. Schmidt sheds new doubt on Volkswagen ’s assertions that top executives did not understand the full scale of the wrongdoing until early in September 2015 more than a year after questions were first raised about emissions from its vehicles . Mr. Schmidt briefed executives in detail months earlier in July according to the criminal complaint filed in federal court in Michigan . The timeline of the briefing has not been laid out before by prosecutors . The complaint also says that other employees were involved in a suggesting that more charges could be coming . It is unclear which employees — above or below Mr. Schmidt — the government believes were involved . Mr. Schmidt reported to officials at Volkswagen headquarters in Wolfsburg . Volkswagen is nearing a deal with the Justice Department to pay more than $ 2 billion to resolve the criminal investigation into the emissions cheating according to three people briefed on the negotiations . The company or one of its corporate entities is expected to plead guilty as part of the deal
" At the Golden Globes afterparties hoi polloi who aren ’t invited to the ceremony descend by the thousands on the Beverly Hilton to whoop it up and stalk celebrities . Hosts of this year ’s Hilton parties — held in ballrooms and massive tents around its compound — included HBO the Weinstein Company Fox NBCUniversal Netflix Amazon Warner Bros. and InStyle . The biggest stars often skipped those parties altogether and instead beelined to the exclusive talent agency fests held at the Sunset Tower Hotel and the Chateau Marmont . Confined to the Hilton the Bagger joined the star stalkers herself seeking answers to the burning question : What did celebrities think of Meryl Streep ’s speech ? ( For a general idea click here ) . The Bagger first cornered the preternaturally glamorous Joan Collins as the British actress was carefully ascending a small flight of stairs at the Fox party . “ I think she is one of the greatest actresses of a generation ” Ms. Collins said of Ms. Streep . “ She has the right to say whatever she wants . And I think if you look at people ’s faces in the audience people went along with her . ” At the HBO party Eddie Redmayne said he found Ms. Streep ’s speech “ incredibly emotional ” but was so distracted by her presence in the audience while presenting the award for best musical or comedy that he almost forgot to read the nominees .

" Here ’s a look at the most memorable moments from the 2017 Golden Globes including Meryl Streep ’s acceptance speech Jimmy Fallon ’s lackluster hosting funny presenters and awkward flubs . Meryl Streep campaigned on behalf of Hillary Clinton so expectations were high that when she took the Golden Globes stage to accept the Cecil B. DeMille lifetime achievement award she would comment on the recent election . But how political would she be ? Pretty political as it turned out . She used her speech to call out Donald J. Trump for seeming to mock a disabled New York Times reporter and to warn that a free press would need to be defended . “ This instinct to humiliate when it ’s modeled by someone in the public platform by someone powerful it filters down into everybody ’s life because it kinda gives permission for other people to do the same thing ” she said . “ Disrespect invites disrespect violence incites violence . And when the powerful use their position to bully others we all lose . ” The room roundly applauded her remarks but on social media some conservative commentators immediately criticized her and the target of her remarks had his own take . In an interview with The Times Mr. Trump dismissed Ms. Streep as “ a Hillary lover ” and said that while he had not watched the ceremony he was “ not surprised ” to come under attack from “ liberal movie people . ” — Daniel Victor and Patrick Healy Read the full text of Meryl Streep ’s remarks and read more about the ’s comments . Jimmy Fallon generally an ebullient cruise director for awards shows wasn ’t a presence so much as a nuisance . The “ La La Land ” intro only really worked if you ’d already seen “ La La Land ” and the segment lacked the pep and fun of
" The biggest presence at Sunday ’s Golden Globes was a TV star who didn ’t show up didn ’t win an award was not thanked and was only rarely mentioned by name . Hollywood ’s first awards show of the year was — like so much in today ’s headlines — brought to you by Donald J. Trump . Even before Meryl Streep took the to the he loomed over Jimmy Fallon ’s monologue . The last time Mr. Trump appeared with Mr. Fallon on NBC ’s “ The Tonight Show ” the host tousled his hair during a softball interview . Mr. Trump ’s subsequent election was both an affirmation of celebrity ’s power and a repudiation of most celebrities ’ politics . So beyond “ Moonlight ” versus “ Manchester by the Sea ” a big question hanging over the awards was how or whether Mr. Fallon would address the Republican elephant in the room . The night began with exactly the kind of bit you ’d figure Mr. Fallon would start with : a parody of scenes from the musical mash note to Los Angeles “ La La Land . ” It was a fitting choice if not an especially hilarious one at the most escapist of awards shows . Music and comedy are the strength of Mr. Fallon ’s “ The Tonight Show . ” ( He brought his bandleader Questlove along as D. J. ) And just as “ La La Land ” is a bubbly tribute to performers and their dreams Mr. Fallon ’s talk show is a stage for celebrities — and politicians — to perform their likability . In his monologue Mr. Fallon seemed determined to show that his hand had claws . He said the awards results were “ tabulated by the firm of Ernst Young and Putin . ” Referencing “ Game of Thrones ” fans who wondered what would have happened if King Joffrey — the show ’s sadistic petty — had lived he said “ in 12 days we ’re going to find out . ” His jokes felt out of character the rest were ordinary . ( He did show off his talent for impressions doing a Chris Rock that reminded us how sharp Mr. Rock had been at the Oscars . ) The most memorable part may have been at the beginning when Mr. Fallon ’s Teleprompter went out . He vamped for a bit and after the commercial break he returned with a joke — likening his mishap to Mariah Carey ’s singing disaster on New Year ’s Eve — that it seemed half of Twitter had already made at that point . Mr. Fallon handled his technical much better than the diva . But he didn ’t make much of it either and that summed up the night . He wasn ’t bad this year just didn ’t seem like his cultural moment . You had to wonder what last year ’s host
" London has its Fourth Plinth where contemporary artists have graced — and sometimes goaded — viewers in Trafalgar Square with sculptural work on a bare pedestal originally intended for an equestrian statue of William IV . Now New York will have its own plinth a highly visible permanent stage for ambitious new international sculpture commissions perched above 30th Street and 10th Avenue on one of the final sections of the High Line . This plinth expected to open sometime in 2018 will likely change sizes and shapes depending on the artwork intended for it . It is a new creation by the High Line being built on the spur that turns east at 30th Street creating a corner that forms a kind of plaza roomy enough for crowds and for larger sculpture than the narrow elevated park now accommodates . Cecilia Alemani the director and chief curator of High Line Art said that the development of the spur which will be ringed by the skyscrapers of the new Hudson Yards office complex prompted her and High Line officials to think about a stage that would hold its own with public art sites like Rockefeller Center City Hall Park and Madison Square Park . The plinth will be tall enough so that work on it will be instantly visible from the street but on the High Line itself the space will be flanked by trees making entering it feel something like walking into a clearing . “ It ’s almost like a jungle ” she said during a recent tour of the plaza ’s construction site . “ It ’s like you leave the city for a while and go somewhere else . And it ’s given us really the only place where we ’ll have the ability to put pieces which will be like a punctuation in a beautiful piazza . ” Sculptures will remain on view for a year and a half at a time . The program will be funded by the Friends of the High Line and private donors at a cost that was not disclosed . Calls for art work went out quietly last year and more than 50 artists submitted proposals . An advisory committee of prominent artists and curators — including Helen Molesworth the chief curator of the Museum of Contemporary Art Los Angeles
" Leading women from politics the arts and other fields urged Donald Trump on Monday to support a new national women ’s museum in Washington that would be affiliated with the Smithsonian Institution . At a meeting in New York to give momentum to the idea the group cited the report of a bipartisan Congressional commission in November that urged construction of the museum . “ It ’s tremendously important ” said Representative Carolyn B. Maloney Democrat of New York who first proposed the project in the late 1990 s . “ How can you empower women if they are not even recognized ? ” The commission recommended “ a national museum dedicated to showcasing the historical experiences and impact of women in this country . ” The commission did not specify a site but said its preference was for the museum to be called the American Museum of Women ’s History to be located prominently in the capital on or close to the National Mall . The museum will require legislation to become a reality . Emily K. Rafferty former president of the Metropolitan Museum of Art and one of the commissioners who produced the congressional report said “ The women ’s tale has not been revealed has not been properly identified or properly articulated . ” The commission proposed that the government provide the land or an existing building for the museum . Private of about $ 150 million to $ 180 million would pay for construction costs it said . A spokeswoman for the Smithsonian Linda St. Thomas said its secretary does not believe the institution is in a position to establish a new museum at this time but was committed to representing the contributions of women in all the Smithsonian ’s museums . Last year on the Mall the Smithsonian opened the National Museum of African American History and Culture the 19th museum or gallery in the Smithsonian portfolio . "
" Greetings Earthlings ! This is your planet and its moon as seen from Mars some 127 million miles away . This composite image which was released by NASA on Friday was created using a special camera aboard the agency ’s Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter which is a spacecraft orbiting about 180 miles above the red planet . The camera is called the High Resolution Imaging Science Experiment . It provides scientists with detailed views of the Martian surface so they can better study geological features like its volcanoes and gullies as well as scope out potential landing sites for future missions . “ It ’s the biggest telescope ever sent to another planet ” said Alfred McEwen a planetary geologist at the University of Arizona and the principal investigator of HiRise . Dr. McEwen said that the image was taken while NASA researchers were trying to calibrate the camera . NASA knows precisely what color the moon ’s near side is so when it wants to calibrate HiRise it points it at the moon and takes some images . NASA then analyzes the pictures and if the colors appear off it can correct the calibration . “ The moon is boring . It doesn ’t change it ’s relatively bland and it doesn ’t have all of these variations or changing clouds . It ’s a good calibration target ” Dr. McEwen said . “ The Earth is a bad calibration target with all its variability like clouds and such but it makes a pretty picture . ” Earth and the moon appear close in this image but that is because the moon is actually just behind Earth . The researchers had to wait until the two celestial bodies were positioned like this because it provided them with the best view of the moon to perform their calibration Dr. McEwen said . To make this picture scientists combined two separate exposures taken on Nov. 202016 which were processed differently . Dr. McEwen said that NASA needed two exposures to make this image because a good image of the moon saturates Earth and a good image of Earth makes the moon appear too dark . Vegetation appears red in this image according to Dr. McEwen . The red spot in the middle of Earth is Australia the one on the top left is Southeast Asia and Antarctica is the bright white blob in the bottom left . "
" The company Uber and local governments often do not play well together . Uber pays little heed to regulation while city officials scramble to keep up with the company ’s rapid deployment and surging popularity . But now with a new product Uber is offering a tiny olive branch to its municipal critics . The company on Sunday unveiled Movement a website it hopes will persuade city planners to consider Uber as part of urban development and transit systems in the future . The site which Uber will invite planning agencies and researchers to visit in the coming weeks will allow outsiders to study traffic patterns and speeds across cities using data collected by tens of thousands of Uber vehicles . Users can use Movement to compare average trip times across certain points in cities and see what effect something like a baseball game might have on traffic patterns . Eventually the company plans to make Movement available to the general public . If urban planners embrace the data that could work toward a future Uber has long dreamed of one in which the company ’s transportation options are woven into municipal planning . “ Our relationships with cities have typically been uneven but there are a lot of places around the world where Uber and the cities we operate in have the same goals ” Andrew Salzberg head of transportation policy at Uber said in an interview . “ We operate better in a world that has policy grounded on data . ” The collected trip data is made anonymous and aggregated Uber said which it hopes will assuage user privacy concerns . That data Uber said will most likely be much more reliable than what is typically used by urban planners many of whom hire agencies to study traffic patterns over time . Often that data is expensive and it can be out of date by the time it is analyzed . Uber argues that its data is more reliable because all of its drivers use smartphones equipped with accelerometers and global positioning technology . One challenge for Uber : improving upon the rocky partnerships it forged in the early data sharing deals it struck two years ago . In a widely publicized move in January 2015
" HOW AMERICA LOST ITS SECRETSEdward Snowden the Man and the TheftBy Edward Jay EpsteinIllustrated . 350 pp. Alfred A. Knopf . $ 27 . 95 . People who reveal secrets are either heroes or betrayers depending on what the secrets are and on the inclinations of the audience for them . In the case of Edward Snowden who took and then released a great deal of internal data from the National Security Agency in 2013 his admirers have campaigned for a pardon by President Obama but Donald Trump has mused that execution might be more appropriate . Journalism based on Snowden ’s revelations won the Pulitzer Prize for public service in 2014 and the Oscar for best documentary in 2015 on the other hand many American government officials think Snowden who lives in Russia should be brought home and prosecuted for revealing classified information . In 2014 Edward Jay Epstein the veteran writer on espionage published a provocative article in The Wall Street Journal proposing another way of looking at Snowden : as a spy . Epstein wrote that an unnamed “ former member of President Obama ’s cabinet ” had told him “ that there are only three possible explanations for the Snowden heist : 1 ) It was a Russian espionage operation 2 ) It was a Chinese espionage operation 3 ) It was a joint operation . ” Now Epstein has produced a long detailed book elaborating on his theory . Snowden is known for having revealed that the N. S. A. was illegally spying on American citizens but Epstein says that he actually took almost a million documents that had nothing to do with that which he didn ’t give to journalists . What happened to them ? How did a relatively lowly nonemployee at the agency without much official access manage to get all that material in the first place ? Why did he choose to announce himself to the world from Hong Kong and why has he remained in Moscow since he left Hong Kong ? You can see the outlines of a coherent hypothesis in “ How America Lost Its Secrets . ” Perhaps Snowden was planted at the N. S. A. by either Russia or China or by both . Perhaps while he was there he worked with other as yet undetected
" To be fair to Casey Affleck he is not the biggest schlump in show business . Adam Sandler takes that prize . And let ’s state upfront that we are talking here strictly in sartorial terms . There is plenty to be said about the more serious of Mr. Affleck ’s shortcomings the ones that have led him to settle two sexual harassment cases out of court and that some say may cost him the Oscar . For present purposes however what concerns us is Mr. Affleck ’s bizarro style a kind of slovenly and idiosyncratic take on normcore that conjures up images of every high school stoner you have ever met . Lately the star has been seen in public a lot picking up prize statuary and barnstorming the circuit — from Jimmy Kimmel to Jimmy Fallon to “ Saturday Night Live ” — for “ Manchester by the Sea . ” In this immaculately calibrated Kenneth Lonergan Mr. Affleck plays a Boston handyman descended into a fugue of volatile depression after a tragic series of events . Making his strongest bid yet for an Oscar the perennially underestimated actor gives a performance so tightly coiled that it threatens at times to crash projection software in theaters and plunge audiences into the dark . Slogging his way toward the biggest award show in February Mr. Affleck has so far picked up Golden Globe Gotham National Board of Review New York Film Critics Circle and Critics ’ Choice trophies . And he has become for now a regular presence in the press and on television the thinking person ’s Bill and Ted . “ Thanks for dressing up ” Stephen Colbert said to Mr. Affleck last February when he appeared on “ The Late Show ” to promote his previous movie the crime thriller “ Triple 9. ” Mr. Colbert was referring to Mr. Affleck ’s hardly bothering : a pair of roomy khakis
" WASHINGTON — Senator Jeff Sessions Donald J. Trump ’s nominee for attorney general pledged on Tuesday to “ say no ” to Mr. Trump if he tries to go beyond the law and he spoke out against torture a ban on Muslim immigration and other ideas that had been floated by Mr. Trump . Mr. Sessions a deeply conservative Republican from Alabama who was an early Trump supporter appears headed for confirmation after completing more than nine hours of testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee . Mr. Sessions and his allies had girded for a coordinated attack on his civil rights record but Democrats tempered their criticism and Republicans mounted a defense describing him repeatedly as a man of integrity . In his two decades on Capitol Hill Mr. Sessions has questioned whether the Constitution guarantees citizenship to anyone born in the United States has said courts have interpreted the separation of church and state too broadly and has declared marriage a threat to American culture . He also voted against reauthorizing the Violence Against Women Act . Much of the hearing focused on Mr. Sessions ’s long record as a prosecutor and a senator but Mr. Trump proved a dominant figure in absentia for much of the debate as Democrats sought to question the by proxy . They asked whether Mr. Sessions supported Mr. Trump ’s most controversial statements and questioned whether he had the independence to rein in the Mr. Trump if he seeks to exceed his presidential authority . In his cool Southern drawl Mr. Sessions vowed repeatedly that he would saying that an attorney general “ cannot be a mere rubber stamp ” for the president . “ If an attorney general is asked to do something that ’s plainly unlawful ” he said “ that person would have to resign ultimately before agreeing to execute a policy that the attorney general believes would be unlawful or unconstitutional . ” But he indicated that he did not believe he would reach that impasse . If he advises Mr. Trump that a policy is illegal he said “ I am confident that he would ” heed that advice . A Methodist he also pledged to set aside his personal beliefs and aggressively enforce all federal laws — even in areas like abortion gay rights and hate crimes where he has made his opposition well known . “ I don ’t think it would be hard for me to be impartial and enforce laws that I didn ’t vote for
" ■ Senator Jeff Sessions of Alabama offered assurances that he would be willing as attorney general to tell Donald J. Trump “ no ” and not be “ a mere rubber stamp . ” ■ He said that waterboarding is “ absolutely ” illegal and that he did not support barring Muslims from the United States . ■ Because of comments he made during the presidential campaign Mr. Sessions said he would recuse himself from any lingering investigations involving Hillary Clinton ’s emails or her family ’s foundation . ■ Retired Gen. John F. Kelly the Homeland Security nominee said that a wall on the border with Mexico would not by itself remedy illegal immigration . Here ’s the latest : Senator Richard Blumenthal Democrat of Connecticut questioned Mr. Sessions about his links to groups and people who have taken xenophobic views . Here ’s a quick primer from a recent Times profile . Mr. Blumenthal asked : “ How can Americans have confidence that you ’re going to enforce laws if you ’ve accepted awards from these kinds of groups and associated with these kinds of individuals and won ’t return the awards ? ” Mr. Sessions said he does not necessarily share the views of every political donor or organization he has received an award from . Mr. Sessions came of age in the Justice Department at the height of the crack epidemic . He has described himself as a lieutenant in the war on drugs said he was “ heartbroken ” when President Obama compared marijuana to alcohol and criticized the administration for not enforcing drug laws in states like Colorado that have legalized marijuana . He said in 2015 : Flash forward to Tuesday . Mr. Sessions sidestepped questions about whether he would put the weight of the Justice Department behind drug prosecution in those states . Doing so would set up a huge fight over states ’ rights and federal drug policy . “ I know it won ’t be an easy decision ” he said . Senate Democrats do not have the votes by themselves to prevent Mr. Sessions from becoming attorney general and they have spared their colleague any vitriol doing little to undermine his confirmation . Mr. Sessions was prepared to face renewed questions about race and comments he was accused of making in the 1980 s regarding the N. A. A. C. P. the American Civil Liberties Union and “ ” views . Liberal activists have repeatedly disrupted the hearing screaming “ K. K. K. ” or “ racist . ” But the questioning from Democrats has mostly focused on his Senate record and whether he would enforce laws that he disagreed with . He has said he would . In short there is no indication so far that his confirmation is in jeopardy . Mr. Sessions who has supported the use of waterboarding as an interrogation tactic said that current law makes it “ absolutely improper and illegal . ” That ’s important because it suggests that Mr. Sessions sees no workaround that would allow Mr. Trump to reinstate such tactics . Mr. Sessions has previously said he supported the Justice Department legal analysis that authorized harsh interrogation in C. I. A. prisons and has said that waterboarding works . By saying that the law against waterboarding is clear Mr. Sessions makes it much harder
1.0"WASHINGTON — Senate Republicans under increasing pressure to ensure that Donald J. Trump ’s nominees are fully vetted by federal authorities have delayed the hearings of four potential cabinet members three of whom have not been cleared by the agency charged with unraveling potential conflicts of interest . As frustrations over confirmations grow a group that supports Republicans accused the ethics office and its leader — in a highly unusual attack on the nonpartisan agency — of politicizing a process long viewed by both parties as arduous but essential for anyone serving in government . Hearings for Betsy DeVos Mr. Trump ’s choice to lead the Department of Education Andrew Puzder his labor secretary nominee and Representative Mike Pompeo Republican of Kansas Mr. Trump ’s pick to lead the Central Intelligence Agency have all been pushed back as Democrats clamor for more time to collect and review the standard background checks that nominees traditionally undergo before their hearings commence . Wilbur Ross Mr. Trump ’s pick for secretary of commerce will also be delayed several days because his ethics agreement is not complete according to the chairman and ranking Democrat of the commerce committee . The delays represent a stumble for the incoming Trump administration which has vowed to run government with a businesslike efficiency and highlights how in several respects its preparation to take office is behind that of predecessors . In the case of Ms. DeVos a billionaire a complex web of financial holdings may be slowing down the Office of Government Ethics which helps federal officials address conflict of interest matters while Mr. Puzder ’s background documents are also not in order .

Inaugural official says they were going for “ soft sensuality ” anyway . ■ A delay for the confirmation hearing of Mr. Trump ’s pick for education secretary Betsy DeVos . Mr. Trump on Tuesday asked a prominent crusader to lead a new government commission on vaccine safety and scientific integrity ushering debunked conspiracy theories about the dangers of immunization into the White House . Mr. Trump who has embraced discredited links between vaccines and autism has asked Robert F. Kennedy Jr . a nephew of President John F. Kennedy to be chairman of the commission Mr. Kennedy said after meeting with the at Trump Tower . Mr. Kennedy ’s appointment spread alarm through the medical community which for years has rejected claims that childhood vaccines are linked to conditions like autism . Medical experts warned Tuesday that Mr. Trump ’s actions would endanger children by confusing parents about the need to have them vaccinated . “ It gives it a that I frankly find frightening ” said William Schaffner a professor of preventive medicine and infectious diseases at Vanderbilt University . He said Mr. Trump and Mr. Kennedy were being fooled by “ ” theories about vaccines . “ This is going to be a sad struggle as we try to protect as many children as possible ” Mr. Schaffner said . Among his many political pursuits Mr. Trump picked up the cause a few years back .

" Good morning . ( Want to get California Today by email ? Here ’s the . ) Let ’s turn it over to Thomas Fuller our San Francisco bureau chief for today ’s introduction . The titans of Silicon Valley like to claim that they ’re inventing technology to change the world and their philanthropic efforts often mirror those big global goals and dreams with initiatives to end hunger and fight diseases . But the arts in San Francisco haven ’t always felt their generosity . Even as total philanthropic spending in the Bay Area has more than doubled over the past decade to around $ 5 billion according to the Foundation Center it ’s been difficult for some arts groups to find support with so many organizations competing for attention and funding . Last year for example with social inequality such a issue one heavyweight charitable organization the James Irvine Foundation chose to stop spending on the arts and switch all of its future giving toward addressing poverty . The move has important repercussions : In 2015 the Irvine Foundation gave $ 15 . 45 million to the arts more than a fifth of the foundation ’s total grants . So on Tuesday culture fans were given a reason to cheer when the William and Flora Hewlett Foundation announced a plan to spend $ 8 million on performing arts projects in the Bay Area over the next five years . A panel of experts convened by the foundation will help select 50 works from artists in the Bay Area . The performances will include dance theater music and performance art. “ There ’s much more of a demand for arts than we can hope to fulfill ” said Larry Kramer the president of the foundation which gets its funding from the fortune made from one of the founders of the pioneering computer company . “ It ’s hard to raise money for the arts ” said Ben Mangan the executive director of the Center for Social Sector Leadership at the University of California Berkeley ’s Haas School of Business . “ The arts don ’t fall neatly into a category of a problem to solve . ” Giving money away is fraught with difficult choices
" Update : A federal jury has unanimously sentenced Dylann S. Roof to die . The white supremacist showed no remorse for killing nine members of a black church in South Carolina . Read more » • Mr. Roof a white supremacist with no known ties to any organized group was convicted of the assault on Dec. 15 by the same federal jury . • Mr. Roof ’s guilt was never in question in the trial and the jury deliberated for about three hours before assessing the death penalty . • Judge Richard M. Gergel has scheduled a formal sentencing hearing for Wednesday at 9:30 a. m. “ We want to express our sympathy to all of the families who were so grievously hurt by Dylann Roof ’s actions . Today ’s sentencing decision means that this case will not be over for a very long time . We are sorry that despite our best efforts the legal proceedings have shed so little light on the reasons for this tragedy . ” “ We are Dylann Roof ’s family . We will always love Dylann . We will struggle as long as we live to understand why he committed this horrible attack which caused so much pain to so many good people . We wish to express the grief we feel for the victims of his crimes and our sympathy to the many families he has hurt . We continue to pray for the Emanuel A. M. E. families and the Charleston community . ” “ No verdict can bring back the nine we lost that day at Mother Emanuel . And no verdict can heal the wounds of the five church members who survived the attack or the souls of those who lost loved ones to Roof ’s callous hand . But we hope that the completion of the prosecution provides the people of Charleston — and the people of our nation — with a measure of closure . ” On the evening of Wednesday June 172015 Mr. Roof a white man walked into the Emanuel African Methodist Episcopal Church in Charleston S.

" In the weeks after Roger Ailes was ousted as the chairman of Fox News in July amid a sexual harassment scandal company executives secretly struck an agreement with a longtime broadcast personality who had come forward with similar accusations about the network ’s top host Bill O’Reilly . The employee Juliet Huddy had said that Mr. O’Reilly pursued a sexual relationship with her in 2011 at a time he exerted significant influence over her career . When she rebuffed his advances he tried to derail her career according to a draft of a letter from her lawyers to Fox News that was obtained by The New York Times . The letter includes allegations that Mr. O’Reilly had called Ms. Huddy repeatedly and that it sometimes sounded as if he was masturbating . He invited her to his house on Long Island tried to kiss her took her to dinner and the theater and after asking her to return a key to his hotel room appeared at the door in his boxer shorts according to the letter . In exchange for her silence and agreement not to sue she was paid a sum in the high six figures according to people briefed on the agreement . The agreement was between Ms. Huddy 47 and 21st Century Fox the parent company of Fox News . The company and Mr. O’Reilly ’s lawyer said her allegations were false . In the aftermath of Mr. Ailes ’s departure executives declared that such behavior would never again be tolerated . Mr. O’Reilly 67
" I ’m on the verge of giving up trying to explain why Ignacio Mattos ’s food is so good . I once wrote that the cooking at his first restaurant now closed dabbled in “ deep surrealist weirdness . ” At Estela the place on Houston Street that put him on the map I described his food as “ almost familiar but not quite . ” What struck me at his most recent restaurant Café Altro Paradiso was “ the inverse relationship between prettiness and deliciousness . ” ( What I ate was unpretty and highly delicious . ) In retrospect nothing I wrote captured the qualities that made the food compelling . I latched on to visual style because I couldn ’t figure out how to explain why the flavors grabbed me the way they did . After spending some time at Flora Bar which Mr. Mattos opened in October I ’ve started to think that whatever it is that sets his food apart is something you can ’t see . It ’s a kind of cooking that ’s almost invisible . Flora Bar is inside the Met Breuer museum Marcel Breuer ’s blunt and muscular stack of granite and concrete on Madison Avenue in the 70 s regarded as a masterpiece of the brutalist style . “ The taste for its disconcertingly inverted pyramidal mass grows on one slowly ” the architecture critic for The New York Times Ada Louise Huxtable wrote in 1966 “ like a taste for olives or warm beer . ” The food at Flora Bar is much easier to like than warm beer . Under the direction of Jake Nemmers the executive chef it comes out of the kitchen in a series of tidily formal circles and squares . The rough edges of the cooking at Altro Paradiso and Estela have been refined which makes it even more astonishing when the flavors come at you out of nowhere . A simple red disc on a white plate

The assault in the Afghan capital was the deadliest of several attacks on Tuesday including an explosion at a government guesthouse in the southern province of Kandahar that wounded the provincial governor and the visiting ambassador of the United Arab Emirates . Wahidullah Majrooh a spokesman for the Afghan Health Ministry said 80 injured people and 30 bodies were taken to Kabul hospitals . Many officials feared that the number of casualties would rise . The Taliban issued a statement claiming responsibility for the Parliament bombings . One witness who was inside the compound said the attack started when a suicide bomber detonated explosives nearby . Then as security forces gathered in the area a few minutes later a car bomb detonated on the busy road that passes in front of the compound the witness said . He spoke on the condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to talk to reporters . An Afghan lawmaker Kamal Safi said meetings were underway in the compound when the attack took place including one about the national budget . “ The explosions took place exactly at the time when government employees were going home so it was a rush hour ” Mr. Safi said . “ More than a thousand people are working there so I know the number of casualties are very high . ” An officer named Mirwais who was among those providing security for the Parliament building said most of the casualties came from a public bus that was passing by the compound when the car bomb exploded . “ It was 4 p. m. and the workers were leaving — they either had private cars or were walking out to the main road for public transport ” Mr. Mirwais said . “ The second attack happened on the main road by the gate and that caused a lot of casualties . ” Violent attacks in Afghanistan have not subsided this year despite the harsh winter with Taliban assaults reported on a daily basis across several provinces in the north and the south . The deteriorating situation in the south in particular prompted the dispatch of about 200 NATO military advisers to Farah Province . And in Helmand Province where American and British troops struggled for years to loosen the Taliban ’s grip at the height of the war
" If you ’re making resolutions for a healthier new year consider a gut makeover . Refashioning the community of bacteria and other microbes living in your intestinal tract collectively known as the gut microbiome could be a good investment in your health . Trillions of microbial cells inhabit the human body outnumbering human cells by 10 to one according to some estimates and growing evidence suggests that the rich array of intestinal microbiota helps us process nutrients in the foods we eat bolsters the immune system and does all sorts of odd jobs that promote sound health . A diminished microbial ecosystem on the other hand is believed to have consequences that extend far beyond the intestinal tract affecting everything from allergies and inflammation metabolic diseases like diabetes and obesity even mental health conditions like depression and anxiety . Much of the composition of the microbiome is established early in life shaped by forces like your genetics and whether you were or . Microbial diversity may be further undermined by the typical American diet rich in sugar meats and processed foods . But a new study in mice and people adds to evidence that suggests you can take steps to enrich your gut microbiota . Changing your diet to one containing a variety of foods the new research suggests may be crucial to achieving a healthier microbiome . Altering your microbiome however may not be easy and nobody knows how long it might take . That ’s because the ecosystem already established in your gut determines how it absorbs and processes nutrients . So if the microbial community in your gut has been shaped by a daily diet of cheeseburgers and pepperoni pizza for example
" CHICAGO — If the metal barricades “ Do Not Enter ” signs and lurking Secret Service agents were a bother the past eight years in the Hyde area — the South Side neighborhood where President Obama still owns a house but rarely has been home — residents are not complaining . “ All that ’s been fine really . You get used to it ” said Adela Cepeda who like many people on Mr. Obama ’s block of Greenwood Avenue met him before he was president or a senator or elected to anything at all . “ To me it ’s just too bad his time will be over . This has been fabulous for Chicago in a certain way . I think that all things being equal we came first . But I guess all good things must end . ” As Mr. Obama prepared to give his farewell address on Tuesday from McCormick Place the cavernous convention center beside Lake Michigan people in his hometown sounded by turns possessive proud anxious and wistful . With his election in 2008 this city — and its heavily South Side in particular — had suddenly been thrust to the forefront of the national political conversation . And so early Saturday in temperatures barely above zero thousands waited outside for the chance to receive free tickets to witness the end of that story . By Sunday tickets were being hawked online for as much as $ 5 000 . Near the Obamas ’ red brick Georgian not far from the University of Chicago
1.0"CHICAGO — President Obama delivering a farewell address in the city that launched his political career declared on Tuesday his continued confidence in the American experiment . But he warned in the wake of a toxic presidential election that economic inequity racism and threatened to shred the nation ’s democratic fabric . “ We weaken those ties when we define some of us as more American than others ” Mr. Obama said “ when we write off the whole system as inevitably corrupt and when we sit back and blame the leaders we elect without examining our own role in electing them . ” Speaking to a rapturous crowd that recalled the excitement of his campaign in 2008 Mr. Obama said he believed even the deepest ideological divides could be bridged . His words were nevertheless etched with frustration — a blunt coda to a remarkable day that laid bare many of the racial crosscurrents in the country . On Capitol Hill Senator Jeff Sessions of Alabama presented himself as a moderate in his confirmation hearing for attorney general while his critics denounced him as a racist . In Charleston S. C. Dylann S. Roof the white supremacist who shot nine black churchgoers was sentenced to death . And here in the cavernous convention hall where Mr. Obama celebrated his in 2012 the nation ’s first black president — still popular still optimistic — bade America goodbye 10 days before turning over his office to Donald J. Trump who ran what his critics labeled a racist campaign . Mr. Obama pledged again to support his successor . But his speech was a thinly veiled rebuke of several of the positions Mr. Trump staked out during the campaign
" Last summer the Justice Department decided to start winding down its use of private prisons . Deputy Attorney General Sally Q. Yates noted in a memo that while private prisons were useful when public prisons were overflowing they made little sense now that the prison population was falling . They didn ’t save much on costs . Nor did they provide the kind of rehabilitation programs proved to reduce recidivism . And they are particularly dangerous . A recent report by the department ’s inspector general found that prisoners in private facilities which house some 12 percent of federal inmates were much more likely to have weapons . Private prisons had many more assaults on inmates and prison workers than those run by the Bureau of Prisons . And they went into lockdown to respond to disturbances 10 times as often . But on Nov. 9 the day after Donald J. Trump was elected president the stocks of correctional conglomerates were among the best performing on the New York Stock Exchange . Shares in Corrections Corporation of America now CoreCivic gained an astonishing 43 percent on the day . The reason ? Privatization is back at the top of the government ’s agenda . While this is being applauded in executive suites across corporate America the cost for the rest of society is likely to be high . “ With prisons I do think we can do a lot of privatizations and private prisons ” Mr. Trump said on the campaign trail last year . “ It seems to work a lot better . ” Mr. Trump ’s pick for attorney general Senator Jeff Sessions of Alabama is a staunch supporter of the approach having invited private prisons into his state as its attorney general more than 20 years ago . But privatization is likely to sweep through not only prisons . The wants to privatize health services provided by the Department of Veterans Affairs . He wants to privatize public infrastructure — drawing private sector companies to fix build and manage bridges and roads water supplies and airports . He is selling privatization as a surefire winner that will deliver better services for less public money . “ There ’s a magical thinking among business executives that something about the profit motive makes everything run better ” noted Raymond Fisman a professor of economics at Boston University . “ What is government going to be like when it is run by billionaire C. E. O.s that see the private sector as a solution to all the world ’s problems ? ” A serious body of economics not to mention reams of evidence from decades of privatizations around the world suggests this belief is false . Consider for instance
" WASHINGTON — The director of the F. B. I. James B. Comey told lawmakers at a Senate hearing on Tuesday that Russian hackers had penetrated the Republican National Committee ’s computer records but he called it a “ limited penetration of old R. N. C. ” computer systems that were “ no longer in use . ” Mr. Comey ’s statement was significant because the committee said weeks ago that it did not lose data to the Russians because of its strong cybersecurity . Donald J. Trump has repeated that assertion and has also said weaknesses in Democratic National Committee systems had opened the way for their systems to be hacked . While Mr. Comey did not go into detail he appeared to be referring to a attack on a contractor in Tennessee Smartech Corporation used by the Republican committee to host some of its websites and handle some lists of donors . Federal investigators have said that a single email server used by that contractor had been penetrated . But it was going out of service and contained outdated material that the Russians probably found to be of little value . People with direct knowledge of the server ’s contents said it had been used by Senators Lindsey Graham and John McCain . An aide in Mr. Graham ’s office said the hacking of the email server in question occurred in June . The Graham campaign was using the server to send news clips and campaign releases the aide said . In an unclassified report released on Friday the intelligence community reported that the Russians had attacked “ ” organizations but that they had chosen not to make any of that data public . The report made no specific reference to the Republican National Committee . Pressed on the issue by Senator Susan Collins Republican of Maine Mr. Comey said on Tuesday that there was “ evidence of hacking directed at the state level ” and at the Republican committee “ but that it was old stuff . ” He said there was no evidence “ that the current R. N. C. ” — he appeared to be referring to servers at the committee ’s headquarters or contractors with current data — had been hacked . There is no evidence that computers used by the Trump campaign or the Clinton campaign were also compromised though the personal email account of John D. Podesta Hillary Clinton ’s campaign chairman was copied and released as part of the hack . The testimony on Tuesday was the first since the release of the declassified report on Russia ’s interference in the 2016 presidential election and it came four days after the findings were described to Mr. Trump . The panel convened by the Senate Intelligence Committee included James R. Clapper Jr . the director of national intelligence and Adm. Michael S. Rogers the head of the National Security Agency and of the military ’s Cyber Command . John O. Brennan director of the Central Intelligence Agency
" WASHINGTON — Jared Kushner will become a senior White House adviser to his Donald J. Trump cementing the New York real estate executive ’s role as a powerful and at times decisive influence on the . Mr. Kushner 35 who married Mr. Trump ’s daughter Ivanka in 2009 is closer to Mr. Trump than any other adviser a steady and stabilizing presence inside an often chaotic transition team who has provided input on most of his ’s most consequential hiring and firing decisions . Mr. Trump described Mr. Kushner as “ a tremendous asset and trusted adviser throughout the campaign and transition ” in a statement issued early Monday evening announcing an appointment that perhaps more than any other defines the way the incoming president will govern . Mr. Kushner plans to sell some of his real estate holdings and other assets his lawyer said . Some ethics experts have questioned whether the appointment will be legal under federal laws designed to prevent family ties from influencing the functioning of the United States government . Other presidents configured their White House hierarchies to mirror experiences in statehouses on campaigns or at the heads of armies . Mr. Trump intends to adopt the management style of a New York real estate empire with family at the pinnacle and staff members however trusted or talented somewhere below . Ms. Trump who also participated in her father ’s campaign decisions has no immediate plans to enter the administration and will restructure her portfolio of holdings . But she plans to step down from the management of the Trump Organization and the Ivanka Trump fashion brand said Jamie S. Gorelick Mr. Kushner ’s lawyer . Mr. Kushner ’s plan is to sell assets to his brother and to a trust overseen by his mother said Ms. Gorelick who added that she had been consulting with federal ethics officials in an attempt to minimize opposition to Mr. Kushner ’s appointment . Under the arrangement Mr. Kushner will divest his holdings in his family real estate firm ’s flagship property at 666 Fifth Avenue sell his stake in the New York Observer newspaper divest his interest in his brother ’s firm Thrive Capital and restructure other investments . He will also divest of all foreign investments said Ms. Gorelick who served as deputy attorney general in the Clinton administration . He will have to recuse himself on matters that could relate to his wife ’s businesses and his remaining holdings
" After Donald J. Trump announced Monday that he would appoint his the real estate investor Jared Kushner as a senior White House adviser lawyers for Mr. Kushner said he would sell many of his assets to avoid myriad potential conflicts of interest . But because he plans to sell to his brother or to a family trust controlled by his mother some ethics lawyers interviewed questioned how meaningful the divestiture would be . Jamie S. Gorelick a lawyer who is advising Mr. Kushner on how to deal with the ethical issues he will have to navigate while advising Mr. Trump on topics that could affect his bottom line said Mr. Kushner would sell his interest in about 35 investments including his family ’s flagship office tower on Fifth Avenue in Midtown Manhattan . He also plans to restructure his role in his remaining holdings so he will not be involved in managing them Ms. Gorelick said . In addition she said he will sell his common stocks resign as chief executive of Kushner Companies his family business and sell The New York Observer . He will also recuse himself from decisions that could affect his remaining holdings as well as those of his wife Ivanka Trump . “ He will be treated as any other person entering public service ” said Ms. Gorelick a partner at WilmerHale and a deputy attorney general under President Bill Clinton . Matthew T. Sanderson a lawyer at Caplin Drysdale and former general counsel to Senator Rand Paul ’s presidential campaign said that ideally the transactions would be independent of the person selling the asset . But as outlined by Ms. Gorelick Mr. Sanderson said
" TEHRAN — Iranians bade farewell to Ayatollah Akbar Hashemi Rafsanjani on Tuesday with the sprawling state funeral veering slightly off script when groups of mourners started shouting opposition slogans . The authorities were forced to raise the volume on the loudspeakers playing lamentation songs after some in the crowds took up cries of “ Oh Hussein Mir Hussein ” a reference to a former presidential candidate Mir Hussein Moussavi who has been under house arrest since 2011 . Some of the chants were aimed at Russia Iran ’s ally in the Syrian conflict . Video clips on social media showed mourners shouting “ Death to Russia ” and “ the Russian Embassy is the den of espionage ” as they passed the embassy ’s complex in the heart of Tehran . People also called for the release of hunger strikers in Iranian prisons . State television broadcasting the funeral live airbrushed the protests which were nevertheless allowed to proceed without police intervention . Mr. Rafsanjani 82 who died on Sunday was laid to rest after an elaborate ceremony that lasted several days . Right after his demise his body was placed in a coffin that was put on public display in the modest house of the late founder of the Islamic republic Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini . For two days mourners had filed through the northern Tehran site untouched since Mr. Khomeini died in 1989 . A religious chanter brought the crowds to tears as he recalled how Mr. Rafsanjani helped to oust Shah Mohammed Reza Pahlavi in the 1979 revolution . “ Our sheikh was so wise he made the shah leave
1.0"From a single gust of wind Clare Hollingworth reaped the journalistic scoop of the century . Ms. Hollingworth the undisputed doyenne of war correspondents who died on Tuesday in Hong Kong at 105 was less than a week into her first job as a reporter for the British newspaper The Daily Telegraph on that windy day in 1939 . Driving alone on the road from Gleiwitz then in Germany to Katowice in Poland — a distance of less than 20 miles — she watched as the wind lifted a piece of the tarpaulin that had been erected on the German side to screen the valley below from view . Through the opening Ms. Hollingworth saw she later wrote “ large numbers of troops literally hundreds of tanks armored cars and field guns ” concealed in the valley . She knew then that Germany was poised for a major military incursion . Hastening back across the border to the Polish side she telephoned her editor with the news a world exclusive .

" Milo Yiannopoulos — the infamous internet troll Donald J. Trump supporter and editor at Breitbart News — has compared Islam to cancer mocked transgender people and suggested that women who are harassed online should stay off the web . Last July he was permanently barred from Twitter for violating the platform ’s rules against hate speech and harassment . So when Threshold Editions a conservative imprint at Simon Schuster gave him a publishing contract the blowback was swift and furious . There were calls for a boycott of all of the company ’s books a vast catalog of some 2000 titles from 50 imprints . Some of Simon Schuster ’s authors — including Karen Hunter Danielle Henderson and Bradley Trevor Greive — denounced the publisher on social media . The Chicago Review of Books said it would not review any of the company ’s books this year . The criticism highlights the minefield that publishers face as they try to court an emerging market of young conservatives who identify with extreme stances on issues like immigration and gender equality — positions embodied with devious irreverent glee by Mr. Yiannopoulos — that they feel are undermining the nation . Many liberals and moderates say however those positions amount to outright racism and misogyny . And the issue has cast an uncomfortable spotlight on a lucrative but often overlooked niche within the largely publishing world . Every major publishing house has a conservative imprint — Penguin Random House has two Sentinel and Crown Forum — and maintains a stable of authors who may not attend literary festivals or mingle at the National Book Awards but command a sizable audience in red state America . Most mainstream publishers try to claim partisan neutrality and publish books across the political spectrum . ( Simon Schuster for example published Hillary Clinton ’s memoir and campaign book as well as Mr. Trump ’s “ Crippled America . ” ) But occasionally publishers get dragged into a political scrum . This past weekend Broadside Books a conservative imprint at HarperCollins became embroiled in a controversy involving a CNN investigation that found that one of Broadside ’s authors
" Alfonse M. D’Amato a former United States senator has given many speeches in his day trying to rouse his peers into action . Not all have worked . But of all those failed exhortations none — at least none known so far — have occurred on a JetBlue Airways flight ending with Mr. D’Amato ’s removal from the plane . Mr. D’Amato 79 who represented New York as a Republican from 1981 to 1999 was removed from a JetBlue flight in Fort Lauderdale Fla . after causing a conflict according to the airline . The episode captured in part on cellphone videos taken by passengers was on a New airplane at Fort International Airport on Monday days after a gunman killed five people there . The JetBlue flight which had been scheduled to depart around 1:40 p. m. Monday did not take off until about 8 p. m. after delays . During the delay Mr. D’Amato stood in the aisle and urged other passengers to walk out with him according to video of the episode . “ We can still speak in this country ” Mr. D’Amato said in the video . “ I am making an appeal to all you people . Stand up for what ’s right and walk out with me . ” At least one unidentified passenger stood to join him . “ I ’m going ” he said . It is not exactly clear what prompted Mr. D’Amato ’s response . The crew was trying to move passengers to address a weight imbalance
1.0"For more than half a century Hubert Edward Spires has lived with the painful memory of being kicked out of the Air Force as a young gay sergeant in the 1940 s . The word “ undesirable ” was printed on his discharge records . But now at 91 Mr. Spires said he can finally be at peace with that part of his life . On Friday he was awakened by a phone call to his Connecticut home and learned that the Air Force Board for the Correction of Military Records had agreed to change his status . This time his discharge would be described as “ honorable . ” “ It was a long haul ” Mr. Spires said on Tuesday in phone call from his home in Norwalk . “ I got the confirmation that I had been looking for . ” Said his husband David Rosenberg whom he met in 1956 and married eight years ago : “ His first words were ‘ It ’s about time . ’ ” Mr. Spires is one of the hundreds of gay former military personnel who have been emboldened by the 2010 repeal of the United States military ’s Don ’t Ask Don ’t Tell policy which prohibited gay men and lesbians from serving openly in the military . In 2011 the federal government allowed changes to veterans ’ military records some of which had been labeled “ undesirable ” or “ other than honorable . ” The incentives for doing so were sometimes financial . Such designations could make it difficult for the men and women who had served to get employment loans or access to veterans benefits . But there was another more important reason . “ The respect factor ” said Matt Thorn an executive director at Legal Defense Network which helps veterans with the application process needed to reverse such designations . “ I served my country honorably I want that respect . And they should have that . ” Mr. Thorn said many go through an application process that can take up to 18 months . But for Mr. Spires
" DETROIT — Just before the holidays on a dark street a few blocks from downtown a group of public officials crowded onto a makeshift stage before a shivering crowd flipped a big switch — and the last of this city ’s 65000 new streetlights blazed on . For years urban decline here was encapsulated in headlines about Detroit ’s lights going out . Nowadays tales of the city ’s slow recovery tend to focus on plucky hipsters from Los Angeles or Brooklyn colonizing abandoned spaces opening pickle companies or tilling little urban agriculture plots . Glossy magazines acclaim Detroit as the next Berlin never mind that Germany ’s reunified capital has always floated on a bed of cushy federal subsidies . Let ’s hope that if anyone writes a history of Detroit ’s rejuvenation a chapter is devoted to the lights returning . Like picking up the trash fixing potholes and responding to emergencies these efforts signal that no matter where you live in Detroit you are no longer forgotten — that government here can finally keep its basic promises . The city postbankruptcy is led by Mike Duggan a strong mayor . Its most solid indicator of progress may come this year with the release of census figures Mr. Duggan told me . After generations of white and black flight there ’s hope the numbers will reveal for the first time in decades the population holding steady or even rising . So far much news about growth has focused on downtown

" A man who admitted changing the Hollywood sign to “ Hollyweed ” has turned himself in to the authorities . Zachary Cole Fernandez a artist surrendered on Monday with his lawyer at his side according to the Los Angeles Police Department . He was booked on a misdemeanor trespassing charge and released on bail . The sign was changed about 3 a. m. on Jan. 1 when two O ’s were partly obscured by sheets and turned into E’s . It remained that way throughout the morning before the sign was restored . In a phone interview Mr. Fernandez said he considered the results more of an art installation than a prank . “ Yeah I broke the rules but I broke it with good spirit and good intentions ” he said on Tuesday . “ It was just to bring light and positivity and happiness . ” But David Ryu a Los Angeles councilman remained unamused . “ Pranks of this nature deplete the resources of our valuable public safety personnel in both responding to the prank and in responding to the increased crowds and copycat attempts that these incidents generate ” he said in a statement on Monday . “ My office has urged the city attorney and L. A. P. D. to investigate and prosecute this case as well as all attempts to trespass near alter or vandalize the sign . ” Mr. Fernandez is expected to appear in court on Feb. 15 . He said he had been inspired by a similar alteration in 1976 and that he had used clamps and sheets so as not to damage the sign . “ I don ’t want to destroy anything ” he said . “ I ’m about peace and love and respect and integrity and a lot of things that in some ways are missing these days . I wanted to show there ’s a light in the world . ” A father of four children ranging in age from 3 to 9 Mr. Fernandez said he had been told he could face up to six months in jail . He said he saw that as excessive for a “ harmless ” art project but would accept any consequences . “ I ’m a person of integrity ” he said . “ If I do something wrong
" The Obama administration rushing to secure its environmental legacy has increased protection for a humble bumblebee . The bumblebee once common across the continental United States has been designated an endangered species by the Fish and Wildlife Service : the country ’s first bumblebee and the first bee from the lower 48 states to be added to the register . Seven bees were previously listed as endangered but they are found only in Hawaii . Since the late 1990 s the population of the bumblebee has declined by nearly 90 percent a result of a combination of factors including exposure to pesticides climate change habitat loss and disease federal wildlife officials said . The species once found in 28 states the District of Columbia and two Canadian provinces is found today only in small pockets of its habitat . The designation will accelerate efforts to protect the bees ’ habitat and to reduce the use of pesticides that are killing them . It is the latest in a flurry of efforts to protect the environment and preserve President Obama ’s legacy on climate change . In the last month he has issued a permanent ban on offshore oil and gas drilling in large areas of the Arctic and much of the Eastern Seaboard announced two new national monuments in Utah and Nevada protecting 1. 65 million acres of federal land and denied six permits for oil exploration in the Atlantic partly because the seismic testing harms marine animals . And the announcement about the bee came a day after the Fish and Wildlife Service said that climate change is the biggest threat to the polar bear ’s survival and that without significant action to fight global warming

Cindy Sherman Richard Serra Louise Lawler Joan Jonas and Julie Mehretu were among the art stars signing the invitation for a “ J20 Art Strike ” which urges museums galleries concert halls art schools and nonprofit institutions to close to protest “ the normalization of Trumpism ” according to a statement . “ It is not a strike against art theater or any other cultural form .

1.0"It was a mystery that captivated Australia for years inspired a Meryl Streep movie and tormented a couple for more than three decades . Now one of the central figures in the case — in which a dingo a type of wild dog found in Australia was found to have killed the couple ’s baby girl — has died . Michael Chamberlain a former pastor who fought for decades to prove to the world that the animal was responsible for his daughter ’s disappearance died on Monday his former wife Lindy Chamberlain told The Associated Press . He was 72 . The cause was complications of acute leukemia according to The Sydney Morning Herald . The couple ’s ordeal began in 1980 when their daughter Azaria disappeared from the family tent while on a trip to the Australian outback . Despite a lack of evidence — a body was never found — blame for the disappearance soon fell on the couple . Ms. Chamberlain who said that she had seen a dingo slip out of the tent was convicted of murder in 1982 and was sentenced to life in prison . Mr. Chamberlain was found guilty of being an accessory to murder after the fact . Three years later new evidence absolved them both . But the Chamberlains still struggled for years to win over public opinion . They were helped by the book “ Evil Angels ” by John Bryson published in 1985
1.0"TEHRAN — The hunger strike a pressure tactic of used by political protesters around the world is forcing Iran ’s powerful judiciary to reconsider the conditions of at least one of its inmates after several started fasts that are leading to widespread support on social media . The exact number of hunger strikers in Iranian prisons is unclear but according to human rights organizations and reports in local media outlets seven inmates sentenced for crimes against the state have refused to eat for intervals ranging from several weeks to more than two months . Their backgrounds vary but they include an antigovernment protester a children ’s rights activist an ayatollah a spiritual leader and a Lebanese computer technology specialist convicted of espionage . It is not possible to verify their conditions because of restrictions preventing foreign reporters from visiting Iranian prisons without permission . While some members of Iran ’s Parliament have said on their social media accounts that they are investigating the reports other officials have dismissed the hunger strikes as plots organized by foreign opposition groups . Conservative critics further argue that the extensive support for the hunger strikers seen on social media networks is an exaggeration created by automated messages . One of the inmates Arash Sadeghi stopped his strike last Tuesday after the judiciary met his demand to temporarily release his imprisoned wife . She was transferred back to prison on Saturday said the couple ’s lawyer Amir Raeesian . Refusing to eat to protest conditions in prison is illegal in Iran but is not uncommon . However the number of inmates now simultaneously fasting
" The best cigarette you will ever smoke Gregor Hens writes in his new memoir “ Nicotine ” is the relapse cigarette . It tastes better he adds “ the longer the prior abstinence . ” This is dangerous knowledge . More than a few smokers relapsed after Sept. 11 . Others did after the recent presidential election as if heeding the poet James Dickey ’s dictum that “ guilt is magical . ” Some of us barely keep the urge at bay . There ’s a dark sliver in a former smoker ’s mind that for dire events so as to justify lighting up again . But it ’s not as if we need large cues Mr. Hens writes when small ones will do . “ Every form of cigarette ad gives me a pang of longing every carelessly cigarette packet at a bus stop every cigarette butt every beautiful woman holding a cigarette between her fingers or just looking like she could be holding one ” he writes . “ My reading chair in Columbus gives me a pang and M. ’s balcony in Berlin and my old Jeep because I ’ve smoked some of the best cigarettes while driving . ” Mr. Hens is a German writer and translator who has lived and taught in the United States . “ Nicotine ” is the first of his own books to be issued in English . It ’s a hybrid volume : part memoir part philosophical lament . It doesn ’t always click . There are passages ( “ I saw myself as a part of a field of tension ” ) that in this translation by Jen Calleja veer close to psychobabble . But when “ Nicotine ” stays dry earthy and combustible
" It was June 2012 and I had just sped out of the crowded subway into a sea of people on 34th Street . I stopped to collect myself to figure out which way I needed to walk to get to my next errand . I was somewhere between Seventh and Eighth Avenues and couldn ’t see the street sign from that far away so I turned my head to the right . Lo and behold there it was right above HM : a beautiful collage of 13 diverse faces for the new hit television series “ Orange Is the New Black ” — me among them . Just five years before this day I was packing my toothbrush my most beloved family photos and my favorite walking shoes . I was headed to the Juilliard School . Seventeen years old . Bright with a head full of bushy hair ready to sprout into a world unlike Simpsonville S. C. the rural area where I grew up . I never would have guessed a year after graduating now 22 I would see my face on a billboard . The feeling was exhilarating . I stood there witnessing thousands of people walk by my face glance at my face . My heart was so happy I almost forgot why I was even in Herald Square to begin with . When I was a kid the famous Apollo Theater had come to my hometown to audition kids for “ Showtime at the Apollo . ” My parents had allowed me to audition not once not twice but three times . For this chubby chocolate the third time was not the charm . I remember crying as I walked back to the car with my father . “ Danielle only one out of thousands of thousands of people will make it ” he reminded me referring to the entertainment business . I remember thinking to myself : Well
" For Najairee Davis high school was synonymous with bouts of anger and frustration . She had the hallway fights suspensions and detention to prove it . Early in Ms. Davis ’s high school career her father was incarcerated on manslaughter charges . “ I was just angry ” Ms. Davis 18 recalled . “ I wouldn ’t talk to anybody . I wasn ’t feeling good about anything . ” Academics were no longer a priority she shut everyone out . And if pressed on anything she said she would pick fights with classmates . Ms. Davis got a bad reputation at school and said it was not long before teachers simply assumed she was to blame for any confrontation . Everyone else went unpunished she said . Her principal at Frederick Douglass Academy in West Harlem suggested she might benefit from transferring to a different school one designed for students who struggle in more traditional education settings . Her boyfriend had attended such a school and compared the experience to being surrounded by a supportive family . “ A family at school ? ” she recalled telling her boyfriend . “ I ’m not really into people that much . ” But in September 2015 Ms. Davis took a chance and enrolled at the Brooklyn High School for Leadership and Community Service a transfer school for students who are falling short of the credits they need to graduate . The school is a joint venture between New York City ’s Education Department and Brooklyn Community Services one of The New York Times Neediest Cases Fund ’s eight beneficiary organizations . “ I just felt like I wasn ’t that excited about school anymore ” Ms. Davis said . “ It wasn ’t exciting to me anymore until I came to Leadership . ” At her new school she received support from teachers who were compassionate and understanding and knew every student by name . She was also assigned an advocate counselor who was on call to help with problems Ms. Davis had outside school . It became clear
" Donald J. Trump on Wednesday conceded for the first time that Russia had carried out cyberattacks against the two major political parties during the presidential election but he angrily rejected unsubstantiated reports that Moscow had gathered compromising personal and financial information about him that could be used for extortion . In a chaotic news conference in the lobby of Trump Tower in Manhattan nine days before he is to be sworn in as the nation ’s 45th president Mr. Trump compared United States intelligence officials to Nazis sidestepped repeated questions about whether he or anyone in his presidential campaign had had contact with Russia during the campaign and lashed out at the news media and political opponents arguing that they were out to get him . “ As far as hacking I think it was Russia ” Mr. Trump said his first comments accepting the conclusions of United States intelligence officials that Moscow had interfered in the election to help him win . But the expressed little outrage about that breach and seemed to cast doubt on Russia ’s role moments after acknowledging it asserting that “ it could have been others also . ” He also quoted a Kremlin denial Tuesday night of reports that it had gathered damaging information to compromise Mr. Trump . “ They said it totally never happened ” Mr. Trump said of President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia and his government . “ I respected the fact that he said that . ” The news conference displayed the showmanship combativeness and sensitivity to criticism that Mr. Trump exhibited throughout the 2016 presidential campaign and underscored his reflex to rebut any criticism or question about his conduct . In his maligning of the nation ’s intelligence agencies journalists and Hillary Clinton the indicated that he would conduct himself the same way in the White House . Using the same boastful tone that characterized his campaign rallies Mr. Trump asserted that his victory in November had vindicated his view that he should not release his tax returns an issue that he said only the news media cared about not the public . “ I won ” he said . “ I don ’t think they care at all . ” In a Pew Research Center poll this month 60 percent of respondents said Mr. Trump should release his returns although just 38 percent of Republican respondents said he should . Some moments bordered on bizarre for the next president of the United States . Mr. Trump spoke of his awareness as a businessman that there were hidden cameras in hotel rooms in Moscow and other foreign capitals . He called himself “ very much of a germaphobe ” apparently in an effort to discredit unsubstantiated claims about sex videos with Mr. Trump and prostitutes in a Russian hotel . “ Does anyone really believe that story ? ” he said
" Times reporters provided analysis and fact checks of Donald J. Trump ’s news conference . Donald J. Trump made an important concession about Russia . He criticized American intelligence officials . He sparred with reporters and denounced “ fake news . ” And that was all before he arrived at the ostensible reason for holding his first formal news conference since July : his plans to extricate himself from the operations of his vast business holdings . Here are the highlights from the whirling hourlong news conference inside Trump Tower . ■ Mr. Trump said that after his briefing on Friday with American intelligence officials he now thought Russia was behind the effort to hack his election opponents . “ As far as hacking I think it was Russia ” Mr. Trump said . ■ However later in the news conference Mr. Trump wavered slightly when pressed on the matter . “ But you know what it could have been others also ” he said when asked why he had been so critical of American intelligence officials . ■ He harshly criticized the publication of unverified reports that claimed Russia has salacious information about his behavior and finances . “ I think it was disgraceful disgraceful that the intelligence agencies let any information that turned out to be so false and fake out ” he said . Explaining his Twitter post comparing the United States to Nazi Germany he said of the leaks : “ That ’s something that Nazi Germany would have done and did do . ” Mr. Trump added that BuzzFeed which published the memos in their entirety is “ a failing pile of garbage ” that would suffer the consequences for publishing the uncorroborated report . ■ Mr. Trump said he was untroubled by other intelligence reports that have been made public which said Russia preferred him over Hillary Clinton and that President Vladimir V. Putin ordered the election meddling to benefit him . “ If Putin likes Donald Trump guess what folks : That is called an asset not a liability ” he said . He added that a strong relationship could allow the two nations to work together on difficult international issues . ■ When asked whether he had a message for Mr. Putin Mr. Trump said : “ He shouldn ’t be doing it . He won ’t be doing it . Russia will have much greater respect for our country when I am leading it . ” He added : “ There ’s no reset button . We ’re either going to get along or we ’re not . ” But he did not address a question about whether he or anyone on his campaign staff had had contact with Russia during the campaign . ■ Mr. Trump swatted away allegations included in the uncorroborated reports . He said that when traveling
" How did American intelligence officials come to brief President Obama Donald J. Trump and lawmakers about supposed Russian plans to blackmail Mr. Trump ? There are far more questions than answers . But here is a look at the story so far . ■ In September 2015 a Washington political research firm Fusion GPS paid by a wealthy Republican donor who did not like Mr. Trump began to compile “ opposition research ” on him — standard practice in politics . ■ Last June after evidence of Russian hacking of Democratic targets surfaced Fusion GPS hired a retired British intelligence officer Christopher Steele to investigate Mr. Trump ’s ties to Russia . ■ After it became clear that Mr. Trump would be the Republican nominee Democratic clients who supported Hillary Clinton began to pay Fusion GPS for this same opposition research . ■ Mr. Steele who had long experience in Russia and a network of connections there compiled dozens of reports detailing what he heard from his contacts . The memos he wrote mostly one to three pages long are dated from June to December . ■ The memos contain unsubstantiated claims that Russian officials tried to obtain influence over Mr. Trump by preparing to blackmail him with sex tapes and bribe him with business deals . They also claim that the Trump campaign met with Russian operatives to discuss the Russians ’ hacking and leaking of emails and documents from the Democratic National Committee and from Mrs. Clinton ’s campaign chairman John D. Podesta . ■ Fusion GPS and Mr. Steele shared the memos first with their clients and later with the F. B. I. and multiple journalists at The New York Times and elsewhere . The memos totaling about 35 pages also reached a number of members of Congress . ■ Last week when the F. B. I. C. I. A. and National Security Agency gave a classified report on the Russian hacking leaking and efforts to influence the presidential election to Mr. Obama
" WASHINGTON — The chiefs of America ’s intelligence agencies last week presented President Obama and Donald J. Trump with a summary of unsubstantiated reports that Russia had collected compromising and salacious personal information about Mr. Trump two officials with knowledge of the briefing said . The summary is based on memos generated by political operatives seeking to derail Mr. Trump ’s candidacy . Details of the reports began circulating in the fall and were widely known among journalists and politicians in Washington . The summary first reported by CNN was presented as an appendix to the intelligence agencies ’ report on Russian hacking efforts during the election the officials said . The material was not corroborated and The New York Times has not been able to confirm the claims . But intelligence agencies considered it so potentially explosive that they decided Mr. Obama Mr. Trump and congressional leaders needed to be told about it and informed that the agencies were actively investigating it . Intelligence officials were concerned that the information would leak before they informed Mr. Trump of its existence said the officials who spoke on the condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to speak about it publicly . The author of the memos is Christopher Steele a former British intelligence officer with who once served in Moscow . After Mr. Steele retired in 2009 he founded a private firm called Orbis Business Intelligence in London . Former C. I. A. officials described him as an expert on Russia who is well respected in the spy world . On Tuesday night Mr. Trump responded to the memos on Twitter : In an appearance recorded for NBC ’s “ Late Night With Seth Meyers ” Mr. Trump ’s spokeswoman Kellyanne Conway said of the claims in the opposition research memos “ He has said he is not aware of that . ” On Wednesday a spokesman for President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia dismissed the allegations . “ The Kremlin has no compromising dossier on Trump such information isn ’t consistent with reality and is nothing but an absolute fantasy ” the spokesman Dmitri S. Peskov
" Donald J. Trump said Wednesday that he would place his vast business empire in a trust controlled by his two oldest sons and take other steps in an attempt to remove any suggestion of a conflict of interest with his decisions as president . But he said he would not sell his holdings . Hours later the government ’s top ethics monitor said the plan was wholly inadequate and would leave the president vulnerable to “ suspicions of corruption . ” The unusual public criticism from Walter M. Shaub Jr . director of the Office of Government Ethics followed Mr. Trump ’s most detailed explanation yet of his plans to distance himself from the global business operations of the Trump Organization . No modern president has entered the White House with such a complicated array of holdings . The steps Mr. Trump outlined include turning over to the United States Treasury any profits received at his hotels from foreign government clients . An ethics officer and separately a chief compliance counsel will be appointed at the Trump Organization to watch its operations and ensure that it is not receiving special terms payment or favors as a result of its ties to Mr. Trump even as the organization is managed by a trust controlled by his two oldest sons and a longtime legal associate . Sheri A. Dillon a longtime lawyer for the Trump Organization said that many of the alternatives ethics lawyers have advocated such as selling off Mr. Trump ’s business assets entirely or putting them in a blind trust that would be managed by an independent party were not practical . Pointing out flaws in a blind trust she said “ President Trump can ’t unknow he owns Trump Tower and the press will make sure that any new developments at the Trump Organization are well publicized . ” In addition she said the price of a sale of assets would draw scrutiny and Mr. Trump would still be owed royalties . The speaking at a news conference Wednesday in Trump Tower repeated his view expressed shortly after his election that as president he will be exempt from conflict of interest laws that apply to all other federal employees except the vice president . But he and his legal team said he would still take voluntary steps to avoid even a perception of a conflict
" He deemed BuzzFeed News “ a failing pile of garbage ” mocked an inquiry about his tax returns — “ Gee I ’ve never heard that one before ” — and in an moment for a presidential news conference shouted down questions from a CNN reporter declaring with some menace “ Not you . ” “ Your organization is terrible ” said Donald J. Trump his voice rising as Jim Acosta of CNN tried to interject . “ No I ’m not going to give you a question . I ’m not going to give you a question . ” “ You ” the said as Mr. Acosta and other stunned journalists looked on “ are fake news . ” Any hope that Mr. Trump would temper his attacks on the news media after the campaign seemed to dissipate in the marble atrium of Trump Tower on Wednesday as the holding his first news conference since July turned a controversy over his ties to Russia into a deft and unrelenting attack on the journalists who reported it . It was a spectacle that attracted nearly 300 reporters to Midtown Manhattan — the news conference was carried live in Australia England and Germany — and it came against an extraordinary backdrop : reports that intelligence officials had briefed Mr. Trump on a document alleging collusion between the Russian government and his campaign . CNN broke the news on Tuesday but declined to publish specific allegations saying its reporters could not verify them . BuzzFeed News published the unverified claims in full a move that prompted an ethical debate in journalistic circles — and offered Mr. Trump an opening . “ The fact that BuzzFeed and CNN made the decision to run with this unsubstantiated claim is a sad and pathetic attempt to get clicks ” the incoming White House press secretary Sean Spicer
1.0"WASHINGTON — The good news for Representative Mike Pompeo of Kansas Donald J. Trump ’s nominee to run the Central Intelligence Agency is that he appears to share the same adversarial view of Russia as most American spies . The bad news for Mr. Pompeo is that he will have to square his views with those of Mr. Trump who has denigrated American intelligence agencies praised President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia and is now contending with a dossier of unsubstantiated reports that Russia has collected compromising and salacious personal information about him . Known as a pugnacious Republican partisan by his colleagues in Congress Mr. Pompeo is going to have pull off the political balancing act of his career to keep the confidence of the Trump White House while winning over the C. I. A. an agency that is notoriously hostile to outsiders in the best of times . His Senate confirmation hearing scheduled for Thursday before the Senate intelligence committee will be the first test of whether he has the diplomatic finesse to manage it . Mr. Trump ’s aides will no doubt be keeping close watch for any signs that they cannot rely on Mr. Pompeo while Democrats on the committee will be eager to look for any daylight between the nominee and Mr. Trump . That will be especially true when it comes to the assessment by intelligence agencies that Russia used cyberattacks and disinformation to undermine American democracy and promote the candidacy of Mr. Trump . At the C. I. A. the concerns are more parochial . The message officials will be looking to hear from Mr. Pompeo is “ I ’m going to protect you from these guys ” said Michael V. Hayden a former director of both the C. I. A. and the National Security Agency . “ Every television set in Langley is going to be on for that hearing ” Mr. Hayden said referring to the town in Northern Virginia where the C. I. A. is based . Mr. Trump ’s mocking response to accusations that Russia meddled in the election has opened an extraordinary breach between an incoming president and the C. I. A. and the revelation that intelligence chiefs briefed Mr. Trump last week on the dossier of unsubstantiated reports is likely to deepen the divide . The dispute has hit morale hard at the C. I. A. current and former agency officials said . At his news conference on Wednesday Mr. Trump said that intelligence agencies were “ vital ” and that they would have 90 days after his inauguration to produce “ a major report on hacking . ” But he also continued to criticize the agencies suggesting that they had leaked the dossier . It was “ disgraceful that the intelligence agencies allowed any information that turned out to be so false and fake out ” he said . The C. I. A. considers its mission to provide cleareyed information and analysis that is free of political interference and it considers the president its main customer . It is sensitive to slights and many at the C. I. A. were especially galled by what they considered Mr. Trump ’s cheap shots at the mistaken intelligence in the prelude to the Iraq war . “ It prides itself on being the president ’s agency
" WASHINGTON — The Senate is getting ready for a very late night . As Republicans push forward with repealing the Affordable Care Act lawmakers are about to undertake a grueling Senate tradition : the a marathon of votes that is likely to stretch on for hours . Yes that ’s really what it ’s called . For at least some people in the Capitol like those who enjoy sleeping when it is nighttime the experience will be unpleasant . But there is a reason for the spectacle . For Democrats it provides an opportunity to draw a distinction between their views on health care and how Republicans are approaching the issue . For Republicans the completion of the exercise clears the way for them to advance to the next step in their quest to gut the health care law . In lieu of the Congressional Budget Act of 1974 here is a primer on what to expect . No. Republicans have embarked on a fragile multistep process to repeal major parts of the health care law one that is on pace to at least take weeks even without any big stumbles . But an important step on the way to repealing the law could be taken soon perhaps early Thursday . The Senate is close to approving a budget resolution that would set in motion the process of drawing up and ultimately passing legislation to repeal the act . Don ’t be fooled by the name . In this case Congress isn ’t working on the federal budget . Republicans are taking a series of steps to allow them to repeal the health care law without facing a Democratic filibuster . Passing the budget resolution will set in motion the process that as drawn up by Republican leaders will culminate in the passage of legislation repealing major parts of the act . The resolution will direct House and Senate committees to come up with that legislation . ( There is some disagreement about the deadline for the committees to finish their work Republican leaders planned for Jan. 27 but this week a group of five Republican senators suggested extending that date by five weeks until March 3. ) The legislation that the committees come up with will be packaged in what is called a reconciliation bill which is not subject to a filibuster . That ’s critical because Republicans have a majority and overcoming a filibuster requires 60 votes . Special rules apply to budget resolutions . Senators can offer an unlimited number of amendments
" WASHINGTON — Elaine L. Chao a veteran cabinet secretary who has served under two Republican presidents offered remarkably few specifics but many promises of cooperation on Wednesday as she cruised through her confirmation hearing to become transportation secretary . Democrats on the Senate committee charged with reviewing Ms. Chao ’s nomination by Donald J. Trump made it clear that they have no objections to her suggesting that she will be easily confirmed in a full Senate vote . Senator Bill Nelson of Florida the top Democrat on the Committee on Commerce Science and Transportation praised Ms. Chao for acting with “ grace and excellence ” in her previous government service . “ I certainly look forward to you in this new administration doing the same ” he said . Senator John Thune Republican of South Dakota and the committee ’s chairman called her “ an ideal candidate . ” Ms. Chao spent most of the hearing promising to examine and learn more about drones fuel efficiency standards air traffic control services and many other subjects that may soon be part of her portfolio . With most of the spotlight falling on Mr. Trump ’s desire for a major infrastructure overhaul — in his own words a priority for his first 100 days in office that could cost $ 1 trillion — Ms. Chao vowed to keep senators informed of emerging plans . She called the overhaul “ a heavy lift ” that would require cooperation both between the parties and between Congress and the administration . “ As the infrastructure proposal is being put together we will certainly be in great discussion with the Congress because once again we can ’t do it on our own ” she said . The selection of Ms. Chao to lead the Transportation Department and its $ 75 billion budget stands out in the lineup of largely billionaire business executives Mr. Trump has nominated to populate his cabinet . She served as labor secretary for the duration of George W. Bush ’s administration and as a deputy transportation secretary under the elder George Bush . Ms. Chao vowed on Wednesday to work with lawmakers on a host of transportation issues — including maritime infrastructure and positive train control a safety system intended to prevent collisions . Emphasizing the need to revitalize the nation ’s transportation infrastructure
" In a move that left many veterans groups breathing a sigh of relief Donald J. Trump on Wednesday selected the current head of the nation ’s sprawling veterans health care system Dr. David J. Shulkin an appointee of President Obama ’s to become secretary of veterans affairs . If confirmed he will be the first secretary to lead the department who is not a veteran . While Mr. Trump ’s chosen cabinet is largely made up of Washington outsiders Dr. Shulkin 57 is a relative insider . He has helped lead several private health care systems including Beth Israel Medical Center in New York and the University of Pennsylvania Health System . In 2015 he was appointed under secretary for health by Mr. Obama and told to cut wait times in the troubled health care system which includes 1700 hospitals and clinics that serve nearly nine million veterans . In that time Dr. Shulkin has nearly doubled the amount of health care that veterans receive through private doctors . But he has also rejected calls for broader privatization saying that it would cost untold billions and undermine the hospital system — a stance that puts him at odds with Mr. Trump . While campaigning the regularly criticized the department as hopelessly corrupt and incompetent and said he would allow all veterans to choose to go to private doctors . But the selection of Dr. Shulkin may signal that Mr. Trump plans to take a more measured approach . “ The Trump campaign made a big deal of what a sucking chest wound the V. A. was ” said Phillip Carter an Iraq veteran who studies the agency for the Center for a New American Security a research organization that focuses on the military and veterans . “ Then they realized how hard it would be to turn around and decided they needed to continue with the reforms that are already taking effect . ” Mr. Carter
" Good morning . ( Want to get California Today by email ? Here ’s the . ) Before disaster struck Anthony Booth Armer had an epic summer . It started one day last June during his shift as a server at a Laguna Beach restaurant . He had a flash of insight he said — he needed a change . “ And I got my stuff walked out and just said : ‘ I ’m going to push it in what I love 100 percent . And that ’s all I ’m going to do . ’ ” That ’s the moment the Laguna Beach jumper was born . Over the next months Mr. Armer 28 became an internet sensation by filming himself making dozens of leaps into water from structures across the region . He seemed to flirt with death rocketing within inches of rocks and ledges . His YouTube videos have raked in more than 23 million views and drawn attention from around the world . Comedy Central ’s “ Tosh . 0 ” ran a segment . Much of the online reaction has been withering with some people criticizing Mr. Armer ’s judgment and predicting a bad end . Fast forward to a couple weeks ago and it happened . Launching himself from a rooftop he struck the edge of a hotel swimming pool and badly shattered both of his feet . Now a gambit that seemed to be going so well has turned his life upside down . Doctors told him he may not be able to run again . Mr. Armer faces trespassing and other charges . His family is angry with him he said . And an anticipated windfall from his YouTube channel never came . ( He said he ’s made roughly $ 6 000 . ) Asked if he harbored regrets he said : “ I mean you could think of it in that way . I think of it as paying dues . I felt like I was in debt with the universe so to speak . ” He added “ I think that this is just a lesson to show that I need to be more respectful . ” And after he heals up ?

" WASHINGTON — Federal prosecutors announced criminal charges on Wednesday against six Volkswagen executives for their roles in the company ’s scandal a sharp turn by a departing administration that is trying to remake its image of being soft on corporate crime . The six executives include a former head of development of the Volkswagen brand and the head of engine development . One of those charged on Wednesday Oliver Schmidt was arrested in Florida last week the other five are believed to be in Germany . Volkswagen also formally pleaded guilty to charges of conspiracy to commit wire fraud and to violate the Clean Air Act customs violations and obstruction of justice . Many of the 600000 cars in the United States equipped with software were imported from Germany or Mexico . The automaker is set to pay $ 4. 3 billion in criminal and civil penalties in connection with the federal investigation bringing the total cost of the deception to Volkswagen in the United States including settlements of suits by car owners to $ 20 billion — one of the costliest corporate scandals in history . “ Volkswagen knew of these problems ” Attorney General Loretta E. Lynch said at a news conference in Washington . “ When regulators expressed concerns Volkswagen obfuscated ” she said . “ And they ultimately lied . ” Extracting a guilty plea from a major corporation is a notable feat for an administration that has been accused of allowing companies to buy themselves out of indictments through deferred prosecution deals . The move comes as outgoing members of the Obama administration race to finish major cases before leaving their jobs . The Volkswagen case is also the first major test of a Justice Department commitment to hold executives more accountable even as the agency braces for big changes in its top ranks under Donald J. Trump . The Justice Department has been criticized for years as being too easy on the banks that caused the financial meltdown and set off a major recession . Though financial institutions paid large fines and settled civil cases executives mostly avoided personal liability . And large companies have rarely faced criminal charges a policy that some critics have derisively labeled “ too big to jail . ” Moving to address that criticism Deputy Attorney General Sally Q. Yates issued a new policy in September 2015 telling prosecutors to focus from the start of their investigations on prosecuting company officials found to have engaged in wrongdoing . Too often Ms. Yates said the Justice Department began with a corporate investigation negotiated a civil settlement and only at the end of an inquiry asked whether any individuals should be prosecuted . “ This isn ’t just a paper policy — I think you ’re seeing the results
" WASHINGTON — As he prepared last week to deliver his farewell address President Obama convened three Democratic leaders in the White House for a strategy session on the future of their party . The quiet huddle included Senator Chuck Schumer of New York and Representative Nancy Pelosi of California the top Democrats in Congress and Gov. Terry McAuliffe of Virginia . One topic of urgent concern according to people briefed on the meeting : how to break the Republican Party ’s iron grip on the congressional map . Thwarted for much of his term by a confrontational Republican Congress and criticized by his fellow Democrats for not devoting sufficient attention to their candidates Mr. Obama has decided to make the byzantine process of legislative redistricting a central political priority in his first years after the presidency . Emerging as Mr. Obama ’s chief collaborator and proxy is Eric H. Holder Jr . the former attorney general of the United States and a personal friend of the president . He has signed on to lead the National Democratic Redistricting Committee a newly formed political group aimed at untangling the creatively drawn districts that have helped cement the Republican Party in power in Washington and many state capitals . In an interview this week at Covington Burling the Washington law firm where he is now in private practice Mr. Holder 65 said that he and Mr. Obama believe Republicans have undermined the political system by creating a patchwork of legislative maps — at both the state and federal levels — that are designed to stifle the will of voters . Echoing a number of Mr. Obama ’s top advisers Mr. Holder described fighting Republican gerrymandering as a “ primary concern ” for the president once he leaves the White House . “ He thinks and I think that this is something that threatens our democracy ” Mr. Holder said . “ We have a system now where the politicians are picking their voters as opposed to voters making selections about who they want to represent them . ” Mr. Holder is set to kick off his initiative on Thursday with a speech at the Center for American Progress a liberal think tank in Washington . The first major event for the group is to take place in Chicago this spring David Jacobson a former ambassador to Canada and an Obama campaign is hosting the event . Mr. Holder said he anticipated that Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr . would also be involved along with other “ present and former cabinet members . ” For Mr. Obama the redistricting campaign signals how personally engaged in electoral politics he intends to be after leaving office
" HONG KONG — Taiwan scrambled fighter jets and dispatched a frigate to the Taiwan Strait on Wednesday after China sent its sole aircraft carrier into the waterway Taiwan ’s official Central News Agency reported . The transit of the aircraft carrier the Liaoning came amid rising tensions between Taiwan and China after Donald J. Trump broke decades of protocol by speaking on the phone with Taiwan ’s president Tsai after his election victory . Ms. Tsai leads a political party that has traditionally supported Taiwan ’s formal independence from China . Ms. Tsai who is visiting Central America this week made two calls to officials in Taiwan seeking updates on the Liaoning ’s transit the Central News Agency reported citing Alex Huang the president ’s spokesman . China ’s decision to send the carrier through the waterway that separates it from Taiwan reflects an early foreign policy challenge for Mr. Trump . “ It ’s a show of force and I think it is intended in part to intimidate and that ’s worrisome from the U. S. and Taiwan ’s point of view because we don ’t know how much more they are going to ratchet up these pressures and tensions ” said Bonnie S. Glaser senior adviser for Asia at the Center for Strategic and International Studies in Washington . “ If the Trump administration does see this as a test of U. S. resolve I suspect they ’ll push back pretty forcefully . ” China sent the carrier which had been conducting exercises in the South China Sea into the Taiwan Strait on Wednesday morning . Taiwan ’s response was the third time in three days that air forces in the region had scrambled jets in response to Chinese military activity after Japan and South Korea deployed fighters on Monday . Those actions occurred when a squadron of six Chinese bombers and two other aircraft flew over the waters that separate Japan and South Korea and over the Sea of Japan . Taiwan considered by Beijing to be Chinese territory has been governed separately since 1949 when the forces of the Nationalist leader Chiang fled to the island after their defeat on the mainland by the Communists . China views any assertion of Taiwan ’s separateness from the mainland — like Ms. Tsai ’s call with Mr. Trump — as an affront to its claim of sovereignty . Since 1979
" President Xi Jinping of China plans to stride into the snowy conclave of the world ’s financial elite next week attending the World Economic Forum at Davos Switzerland the first time a top Chinese leader will put himself into the mix of political leaders and business executives who view themselves as the masters of the global economy . His participation was announced by the Chinese Foreign Ministry on Tuesday . It is the latest and in some ways the boldest Chinese attempt to compete with the United States ’ dominant position in world economic and strategic institutions a campaign that has been carried out everywhere from the conference rooms of Asian central banks to the waters of the South China Sea to the halls of the United Nations in New York . But it is unclear whether Mr. Xi who rarely ventures beyond platitudes in discussing the strategies of the world ’s second largest economy can take advantage of this time of transition when the rest of the world is gauging whether the United States is pulling back from global leadership . Mr. Xi may sense an opening during a historic inflection point . He plans to deliver a speech at Davos at a moment when the incoming United States president Donald J. Trump has suggested that the United States should withdraw from the traditional superpower role it has played since World War II including its leadership of a global free trade agenda . In recent years Davos had come to embody that agenda — a gathering at an Alpine ski resort of some of the world ’s most powerful figures in the realms of politics media and technology . Discussions each year have been set by Western leaders not Asian ones . But events of the past year brought into sharp focus a rise in populist denunciations of globalization free trade and inequality in some Western nations including the United States with Davos frequently mentioned by critics as a symbol of the root causes of their countries ’ ailments . China has benefited greatly from access to international trade markets since its entry in 2001 into the World Trade Organization and it could now become the most vocal proponent of that system . Mr. Trump campaigned on opposition to the existing global trade system and has denounced China for competing unfairly against the United States . At Davos Mr. Xi plans to lead a delegation of senior officials
" First it was the icy snow . Now comes the freezing rain . An arctic blast that has reached as far south as the Mediterranean is generating perilous conditions for thousands of refugees in overcrowded migrant camps in Greece and prompting the European Union to declare the situation “ untenable . ” On Wednesday a Greek navy ship docked at Lesbos island to take on as many as 500 refugees . They have been struggling to survive the subzero temperatures in the severely overcrowded main camp in Moria using pup tents that were supposed to be temporary when they were set up last year in warmer weather . Video and photos taken by migrants inside the camp and posted to social media showed flimsy shelters sagging under a blanket of snow and people waiting in long lines in the falling snow for food and to use bathrooms . In one video a man identifying himself as a migrant shows people lifting the flaps of tents near a slushy pathway . “ Look at how human beings are living ” said the man speaking French . Imploring officials of the European Union to look at the situation themselves he said : “ Why can ’t people leave here ? How is it possible to live in these conditions my God ? ” On Tuesday night the snow turned to freezing rain forming rivers of muck around the camp and drenching tents and clothing aid organizations reported . On Samos another island where the main migrant camp is overflowing refugees reported freezing conditions with no heat . At refugee camps on the Greek mainland and especially near the northern border migrants continued to grapple with living outside under heavy snowfall . “ This is unbearable ” said Roland Schoenbauer a spokesman for the United Nations high commissioner for refugees who said he was receiving reports from doctors in camps across Greece warning of rising health risks from the cold and humidity . “ It shows what happens when you try to squeeze too many people into these camps . You can ’t stockpile human beings . ” A year after the European Union sealed its borders to large numbers of newcomers Greece remains Europe ’s holding pen for nearly 60000 men
" KABUL Afghanistan — Abdul Ali Shamsi had already covered a lot of ground before he moved to Kandahar Province to become deputy governor a year and a half ago . Mr. Shamsi was at the vanguard of a new generation of Afghan leaders . From an early job as a security guard in Kabul he became a security expert in Helmand Province and moved up in the provincial government there . And he helped found the Afghanistan 1400 youth political movement starting public campaigns to console victims of violence around the country and to raise support for Afghan governance . “ These efforts have two impacts : One is we stand up against things we believe are wrong but the other more important factor is we project courage ” he told The Guardian newspaper a few years ago as he was spearheading an effort to clean up and reopen a lakeside picnic spot in Kabul after a Taliban attack . “ We enable people to stand up against violence people who in many ways have been passive because of fears instilled among the population . ” On Tuesday Mr. Shamsi 38 became a victim of the kind of violence he had helped others withstand killed along with 10 other people when explosives placed within the Kandahar governor ’s guesthouse detonated during a reception for visiting Arab officials . He was the third Kandahar deputy governor to be killed in the line of duty in just a few years and he knew in taking the job that he would be just as much a target as his two predecessors — one a young poet and writer who was gunned down in a university classroom and before that an engineer who was killed by a suicide bomber on his way to work . The attack in Kandahar this week seemed expressly aimed at breaking down the cause that Mr. Shamsi and his colleagues were dedicated to : trying to restore faith in government after years of devastating war and disappointing failures . Among the dead were an Afghan senator and a member of Parliament five officials from the United Arab Emirates and an Afghan envoy to the United States according to officials . Eighteen others were wounded . The governor of Kandahar Humayoon Azizi and the ambassador of the United Arab Emirates
" SEOUL South Korea — A special prosecutor investigating the corruption scandal that led to President Park ’s impeachment summoned the de facto head of Samsung for questioning on Wednesday calling him a bribery suspect . The de facto leader Jay Y. Lee the vice chairman of Samsung will be questioned on Thursday according to the special prosecutor ’s office which recommended that he also be investigated on suspicion of perjury . Mr. Lee effectively runs Samsung South Korea ’s largest conglomerate he is the son of its chairman Lee who has been incapacitated with health problems . He is expected to be asked whether donations that Samsung made to two foundations controlled by Choi a longtime friend of the president amounted to bribes and what role if any he played in the decision to give the money . Investigators at the special prosecutor ’s office have questioned other senior Samsung executives as suspects about the bribery accusations . Neither Samsung nor Mr. Lee responded immediately to the announcement on Wednesday . Allegations that Ms. Park helped Ms. Choi extort millions in bribes from Samsung and other companies are at the heart of the corruption scandal that led to the National Assembly ’s vote to impeach her last month . Since then Ms. Park ’s powers have been suspended and she is on trial at the Constitutional Court which will ultimately decide whether to end her presidency . Last month Mr. Lee testified at a National Assembly hearing that he was not involved in the decision by Samsung to make the donations . He also said that the donations were not voluntary suggesting that the company was a victim of extortion not a participant in bribery . The reference on Wednesday to possible perjury charges against Mr. Lee stemmed from that testimony . The special prosecutor ’s office said it had evidence that Mr. Lee had “ received a request for bribery from the president and ordered Samsung subsidiaries to send bribes to destinations designated by the president . ” It asked the National Assembly to file a perjury complaint against Mr. Lee which would authorize the special prosecutor to open an investigation of that charge . Asked whether investigators would seek to arrest Mr. Lee on bribery charges
" Photographs recently released by the Australian government show that light weapons seized from a smuggling vessel near Yemen ’s coast appear to have been manufactured in Iran further suggesting that Tehran has had a hand in a gunrunning operation to the Horn of Africa and the Arabian Peninsula . The weapons a selection of at least nine grenade launchers were among thousands of weapons seized by an Australian warship the Darwin in February from an Iranian dhow that was sailing under the name Samer . The photographs of the weapons a sample of the much larger quantity of arms were obtained by the Small Arms Survey a international research center after a long dispute with the Australian military . Iran has been repeatedly accused of providing arms helping to fuel one side of the war in Yemen in which rebels from the country ’s north known as the Houthis ousted the government from the capital Sana in 2014 . The United States and other Western governments have provided vast quantities of weapons and other forms of military support to the embattled government and its allies in a coalition led by Saudi Arabia contributing to violence that the United Nations said last year had caused more than 10000 civilian casualties . Matthew Schroeder an analyst for the survey said a study of the weapons ’ characteristics and factory markings had showed that they match grenade launchers previously documented in Iraq in 2008 and 2015
" President Obama delivered his farewell address in Chicago on Tuesday . The following is the complete transcript as provided by the Federal News Service . OBAMA : Hello Chicago ! ( APPLAUSE ) It ’s good to be home ! ( APPLAUSE ) Thank you everybody ! ( APPLAUSE ) Thank you . ( APPLAUSE ) Thank you . ( APPLAUSE ) Thank you so much thank you . Thank you . Thank you . ( APPLAUSE ) It ’s good to be home . Thank you . ( APPLAUSE ) We ’re on live TV here I ’ve got to move . ( APPLAUSE ) You can tell that I ’m a lame duck because nobody is following instructions . ( LAUGHTER ) Everybody have a seat . My fellow Americans Michelle and I have been so touched by all the that we ’ve received over the past few weeks . But tonight it ’s my turn to say thanks . Whether we have seen or rarely agreed at all my conversations with you the American people — in living rooms and in schools at farms and on factory floors at diners and on distant military outposts — those conversations are what have kept me honest and kept me inspired and kept me going . And every day I have learned from you . You made me a better president and you made me a better man . So I first came to Chicago when I was in my early twenties and I was still trying to figure out who I was still searching for a purpose to my life . And it was a neighborhood not far from here where I began working with church groups in the shadows of closed steel mills . It was on these streets where I witnessed the power of faith and the quiet dignity of working people in the face of struggle and loss . ( CROWD CHANTING “ FOUR MORE YEARS ” ) I can ’t do that . Now this is where I learned that change only happens when ordinary people get involved and they get engaged and they come together to demand it . After eight years as your president I still believe that . And it ’s not just my belief . It ’s the beating heart of our American idea — our bold experiment in . It ’s the conviction that we are all created equal endowed by our creator with certain unalienable rights among them life liberty
" It ’s the first year that United Airlines will be offering “ basic economy ” fares — the lowest prices on a particular flight but with notable restrictions such as : You don ’t receive a seat assignment until ( and sitting next to your traveling companions is not guaranteed ) you ’re the last to board and you ’re not allowed to bring on a bag ( which means no use of the overhead bins ) . On the list of things travelers care about overhead storage is second only to legroom according to interviews conducted in December by Morning Consult a media and technology company . Even so 45 percent of fliers said they would buy a “ basic economy ” fare . And those travelers aren ’t necessarily strapped for cash : Some 39 percent of fliers earning $ 100 000 or more told Morning Consult that they were likely to purchase a basic economy ticket . Are there loopholes to get around those restrictive baggage and boarding rules ? Will more major airlines begin restricting access to their overhead bin space ? And while we ’re talking about space which size will actually make it past the gate agent and onto the plane ? Let ’s begin with United ’s new fares . If you buy one of United ’s “ basic economy ” fares you can bring along a personal item like a laptop bag or backpack that is 9 inches by 10 inches by 17 inches or less but not luggage ( hence why you ’re not given access to the overhead bins ) . But there are ways around those rules . In fact there are three ways to bring on luggage and use the overhead bins even if you purchase a “ basic economy ” fare : 1. If you ’re a Premier member of the airline ’s MileagePlus loyalty program . 2. If you ’re the primary card member of a qualifying MileagePlus credit card . 3. If you ’re a Star Alliance Gold member ( a frequent flier in the Star Alliance network of nearly 30 airlines ) . Any of the above will also prevent you from having to board last as well . While United is the first major airline based in the United States to essentially start charging for its overhead bin space charging for bags is old hat on airlines . Frontier charges about $ 30 to $ 60 for a bag . Allegiant charges about $ 15 to $ 50 per bag . Spirit Airlines and Wizz Air also charge for luggage . There are ways to pay less though . Take Frontier . It charges for bags but the airline also offers packages like “ the Works ” and “ the Perks ” that include a bag as well as extras ( albeit they ’re givens on many major airlines ) such as seat selection and priority boarding . Remember too that it ’s generally cheaper to pay for your bag online rather than at the airport . On Frontier a bag costs up to 50 percent less if you pay online instead of at the ticket counter or the gate . Whether other major United States carriers join United and introduce new rules for their overhead bin space remains to be seen but it will not be surprising if they eventually do given that the airlines tend to copy one another if a new practice is successful . Indeed the latest segmentation of economy fares into seats and premium seats began with Delta Air Lines and has since been adopted by American Airlines and United . If travelers take to United ’s basic economy fares expect the practice to become more widespread . There is no universal bag size . Each airline has its own rules . And baggage allowances may vary across routes and cabin classes . In 2015 the International Air Transport Association
" You may know there ’s added sugar in your Coke or cookies . But did you know that it ’s in your salad dressing pasta sauce and bread ? The Food and Drug Administration came out Friday with its new template for nutrition labels . One big change was the addition of a line for “ added sugar ” to be placed below a line for total sugar . The change is designed to distinguish between sugars that are naturally occurring in a food — like the milk sugar in a plain yogurt — and the sugars that food manufacturers include later to boost flavors — like the “ evaporated cane juice ” in a Chobani Kids strawberry yogurt . A team of researchers at the University of North Carolina conducted a detailed survey of the packaged foods and drinks that are purchased in American grocery stores and found that 60 percent of them include some form of added sugar . When they looked at every individual processed food in the store 68 percent had added sugar . Some of those products are more obvious sugary foods but not all . The list includes many sauces soups fruit juices and even meat products . You might think it ’s easy to figure out whether the food manufacturer added sugar to your food but it isn ’t always so . While some foods include “ sugar ” in their ingredients many use different words for products that are nutritionally similar . Most of us have heard of corn syrup a sugar made from processing corn . But there are also things like the “ evaporated cane juice ” in the yogurt and “ rice syrup ” and “ ” which are less obvious and amount to the same thing . Barry Popkin a professor of nutrition at the University of North Carolina and one of the paper ’s authors said that the wide variety of sugars is not always meant to confound consumers . Instead he said the many sugar types are chosen by food scientists to give their products the best flavor and texture . Some sugars are better for baked goods while others are better in soft drinks . Some are also cheaper than others . Sugar tariffs and import laws make it expensive to bring in too much foreign sugar . But not all of the sugar formulations count toward the laws ’ quotas . There ’s also the matter of fruit juice concentrates which are juices that have been stripped of nearly everything but sugar and evaporated . A lot of seemingly natural foods include ingredients like “ apple juice concentrate . ” That ’s sugar . That will be a lot clearer when the labels are updated . “ It ’s going to really surprise people who go to organic and whole foods stores when they find that all this natural food they ’ve been buying is full of added sugar ” Mr. Popkin said . “ It ’s full of fruit juice concentrates and they thought it was all good stuff . ” The emphasis on added sugar comes from new nutrition guidelines that urge Americans to consume a “ healthy dietary pattern ” containing certain types of foods . According to the regulation
" ISTANBUL — The domes of the great mosques covered in white . The soaring minarets that draw Istanbul ’s singular skyline peeking out behind a gray haze of flurries . The street carts selling roasted chestnuts the old tram making its way slowly the street cats huddling around heaters in cafes — all gave the city the feel of an old photograph . Snow in Istanbul always feels magical but for a few days this week and last a blizzard — at more than a foot it was the heaviest snowfall since 2009 — was just what the city needed . It acted as a balm for the chronic fear and anxiety that had taken over amid terrorist attacks political instability and the deep purges of civil society that began after a failed coup last summer . “ This all blends into a feeling of suspension of normal daily life ” said Orhan Pamuk a Nobel laureate who coincidentally wrote an acclaimed novel called “ Snow . ” “ And perhaps this time because of horrors of politics — tens of thousands of professors and people are being fired from their jobs and journalist and writer friends are being pushed into prisons — at least for five minutes this is a consolation . ” In his many books Mr. Pamuk 64 has created a language of Istanbul its intricacies its mysteries its landscapes .

" Nine busloads of immigrant activists from Brooklyn Queens and Long Island will depart before dawn for the trip to Washington intent on making their voices heard . They will be blasting protest playlists while carrying posters and flags from the familiar rainbow to the worn colors of Haiti . But they are not going to the better known Women ’s March on Washington planned for Jan. 21 the day after Donald J. Trump ’s inauguration . Instead they are headed to the nation ’s capital on Saturday for a more modest rally focused on the rights of immigrants called We Are Here to Stay and scheduled to start at 11 a. m. at the Metropolitan A. M. E. Church . For these groups there was a practical if not urgent reason to hold the rally on Jan. 14 : Barack Obama will still be president . “ As an organizer the 14th is a date that I feel safe mobilizing people to Washington ” said Natalia Aristizabal of Make the Road New York one of the rally ’s sponsors . “ We don ’t know what ’s going to happen after the inauguration . ” National and local organizers said they were concerned about the possibility of undocumented protesters being arrested during the new administration especially since Mr. Trump said he planned to deport the two million to three million undocumented immigrants that he said had criminal convictions . Cristina Jiménez the executive director of United We Dream the national organization promoting the interests of undocumented youth known as dreamers called the threat to immigrant communities “ imminent ” and added : “ To be quite frank we fear the worst . ” That is not to say that immigrants will be avoiding the women ’s march . Some organizations like United We Dream and the New York Immigration Coalition
1.0"BEIJING — For generations the “ War of Resistance Against Japanese Aggression ” has been ingrained in the minds of Chinese schoolchildren . Revolutionary hymns evoked the bloody years from 1937 to 1945 of what is known outside China as the Second War . Chinese documentaries denounced Japan ’s “ eight years of belligerence . ” Now the war is getting a new name and an extended time frame . In a move aimed at stirring up nationalism and support for the ruling Communist Party President Xi Jinping ’s government has ordered educators to rewrite textbooks to describe the conflict as the “ War of Resistance Against Japanese Aggression ” lasting from 1931 to 1945 the authorities said in a statement on Wednesday . Under the decision the Second War will be described as having started in the fall of 1931 when the Imperial Japanese Army invaded Manchuria . Previously the war ’s beginning had been traced to the Marco Polo Bridge incident a skirmish in 1937 between Japanese forces and Chinese troops along a rail line southwest of Beijing that represented the beginning of conflict . The Chinese Ministry of Education said the decision to add six years to the war sought to promote patriotic education and to highlight the Communist Party ’s “ core role ” in resisting Japanese fascism in the prelude to World War II . It also seemed intended to rally support for the party among young people as Mr. Xi vigorously promotes Communist history and thought in schools . Zhang Lifan a historian in Beijing said the decision to revise the length of the war was justified from a historical perspective . But he said it would also have political benefits for the party and would encourage sentiment . “ Chinese leaders still have a Cold War mentality ” he said . “ They ’ve tried to conjure up imaginary enemies in the world . ” Mr. Xi has worked in recent years to enhance the image of the Communists and their achievements in World War II even though many historians believe it was the Chinese Nationalists not the Communists who did most of the fighting . The party had not previously emphasized the fight against the Japanese from 1931 to 1937 when Communist forces were in disarray as they fought a civil war with the Nationalists . During that time
" Eighteen women and girls have filed a federal lawsuit alleging that a Michigan doctor sexually assaulted them and that U. S. A. Gymnastics and other organizations that employed him failed to address their concerns and prevent further abuse some of it dating back to the late 1990 s . In the civil suit filed against Dr. Lawrence Nassar on Tuesday in Federal District Court in western Michigan the plaintiffs are seeking relief for injuries related to sexual assault nonconsensual touching abuse and molestation . They say the abuse occurred while they were participating in gymnastics swimming figure skating track and field field hockey basketball and soccer . Most of the plaintiffs were minors when the abuse occurred according to the suit which alleges that Dr. Nassar “ sexually assaulted abused and molested ” the athletes including by “ digital vaginal and anal penetration . ” The lawsuit is the latest legal action against Dr. Nassar . In November he was charged in Ingham County Mich . with sexual conduct with a person under 13 and in December he was indicted in federal court in Grand Rapids Mich . on child pornography charges . Matthew R. Newburg Dr. Nassar ’s lawyer in those state and federal criminal cases said by email on Wednesday that his client has pleaded not guilty in those cases . “ We are still receiving discovery and continue to review the reports as we receive them
" The sports landscape is littered with failed professional football leagues such is the dominance of the N. F. L. Yet the sports agent Don Yee who represents New England Patriots quarterback Tom Brady thinks he may have found a model that will work : a league for to players who skip college to play professionally right away . Most fledgling leagues like the defunct U. F. L. or the X. F. L. had rosters filled with castoffs who had gone undrafted out of college or who had bounced around pro teams . The quality of play was uneven while games often overlapped with the N. F. L. and N. C. A. A. calendars making it hard to gain attention . Yee and his investment group see their new Pacific Pro Football league which is expected to start in summer 2018 as more of a development league filled with players who want to immediately start playing a game while getting a paycheck rather than risking injury on a college team and receiving no compensation . “ Most other leagues usually took players who were deemed not good enough for the N. F. L. ” Yee said . “ We ’re now trying to go to the head of the line at the buffet instead of getting the ones . ” Despite the long odds of success Yee is not the only person trying to get a football league off the ground . In April a new spring league will roll out in West Virginia where players “ who may have been overlooked by the N. F. L. C. F. L. and other professional leagues ” can pay $ 350 to showcase their talents in a season the league ’s website says . The N. F. L. also has toyed with starting a developmental league . In October Commissioner Roger Goodell said the team owners had discussed the idea of working with 300 to 400 players to make them “ ready to play as quickly as possible ” though nothing concrete emerged from the discussions . Other leagues already employ teenagers who skip college . Major League Baseball clubs draft young players and send them to their academies or minor league affiliates . Many N. H. L. teams have players as young as 18 on their rosters . Players can join N. B. A. teams if they are 19 and a year removed from high school . ( In 2001 the N. B. A. started its own development league where the players can be 18 . ) N. F. L. teams can draft only players who are three years removed from their high school class ’s graduation a rule the league said is intended to protect younger less physically developed players . “ The physical
" The commander of a Brooklyn police precinct has apologized for remarks he made to the media and at a local community meeting last week in which he played down a recent surge in rapes in his neighborhood saying most were date rapes not “ true stranger rapes . ” In a post on Twitter on Monday afternoon Capt. Peter R. Rose of the 94th Precinct in Greenpoint said “ I deeply regret the statements I made last week about rape ” adding that his comments “ were not meant to minimize the seriousness of sexual assault . ” “ Every rape whether it is perpetrated by a stranger or someone known to them is fully investigated ” Captain Rose wrote . “ We make no distinction in our response . ” The apology came days after the officer was quoted in an article on the local news website DNAinfo . com about an increase of sexual violence in the neighborhood of Greenpoint where there were eight reported attacks or attempted attacks in 2015 and 13 last year . Of last year ’s cases three led to arrests but 10 — including two allegedly by taxi drivers on young female passengers — remain unsolved . In the article which appeared on Friday Captain Rose told DNAinfo . com that while every rape should be investigated the spike in reported assaults was “ not a trend that we ’re too worried about ” because many of them had been committed by acquaintances of the victims . “ If there ’s a true stranger rape ” Captain Rose went on “ a random guy who picks up a stranger off the street those are the troubling ones . That person has like no moral standards . ” Not long after the interview Captain Rose elaborated on the unsolved sex assault cases at a meeting of the 94th Precinct community council where he said some of the attacks had involved of the victims and others hookup apps like Tinder and thus were “ not rapes where strangers are being dragged off the streets . ” He added that the cases remained open because the victims refused to cooperate with investigators and in some cases left New York for their homes in other states . Both of his comments set off a firestorm of criticism from public officials and advocates for victims of sexual assault who condemned Captain Rose for perpetuating the idea that rapes committed by those who know their victims are somehow less troubling than those committed by strangers . “ Rape is rape ” Eric Phillips
" There really could be only one appropriate home for Bruce Springsteen ’s archives : the Jersey Shore . And indeed that is where they will go through a partnership announced Tuesday with Monmouth University in West Long Branch N. J. As part of the partnership the university will establish the Bruce Springsteen Archives and Center for American Music which will be the repository for Mr. Springsteen ’s personal collection of written works photographs periodicals and various artifacts from throughout his career . The university — just miles from Asbury Park one of the towns where Mr. Springsteen started his musical career — said in a statement that the new center would promote the legacy of Mr. Springsteen and other giants of American music like Woody Guthrie and Robert Johnson . Its materials would also bolster curriculums at the university including at its music business program . “ The establishment of the Bruce Springsteen Archives and Center for American Music celebrates and reinforces the Jersey Shore ’s legacy in the history of American music while providing a truly transformative experience for our students ” Paul R. Brown the university ’s president said in a statement . The university offered few other details about the collection or its plans for the new center including any financial information about the partnership . But Mr. Springsteen ’s materials will join what is already a major trove of memorabilia at Monmouth the Bruce Springsteen Special Collection . That collection includes nearly 35000 items — compiled in part by fans — which has been housed at Monmouth since 2011 . One of the figures involved in bringing the archives to Monmouth University was Robert Santelli the executive director of the Grammy Museum in Los Angeles who is expected to take on a leadership role at the new center . Mr. Santelli a Monmouth alumnus also helped secure the special collection for the university in 2011 . The arrangement with Monmouth comes as archives have become increasingly valuable to museums
" Joachim Neander was a Calvinist theologian who often hiked through a valley outside Düsseldorf Germany writing hymns . Neander understood everything around him as a manifestation of the Lord ’s will and work . There was no room in his worldview for randomness only purpose and praise . “ See how God this rolling with beauty as a robe ” one of his verses goes . “ Forests fields and living its Master ’s glory sings . ” He wrote dozens of hymns like this — and . Then he caught tuberculosis and died at 30 . Almost two centuries later in the summer of 1856 workers quarrying limestone in that valley dug up an unusual skull . It was elongated and almost chinless and the fossilized bones found alongside it were extra thick and fit together oddly . This was three years before Darwin published “ The Origin of Species . ” The science of human origins was not a science the assumption was that our ancestors had always looked like us all the way back to Adam . ( Even distinguishing fossils from ordinary rock was beyond the grasp of many scientists . One popular method involved licking them if the material had animal matter in it it stuck to your tongue . ) And so as anomalous as these German bones seemed most scholars had no trouble finding satisfying explanations . A leading theory held that this was the skeleton of a lost bowlegged Cossack with rickets . The peculiar bony ridge over the man ’s eyes was a result of the poor Cossack ’s perpetually furrowing his brow in pain — because of the rickets . One British geologist William King suspected something more radical . Instead of being the remains of an atypical human they might have belonged to a typical member of an alternate humanity . In 1864 he published a paper introducing it as such — an extinct human species the first ever discovered . King named this species after the valley where it was found

" WASHINGTON — The Justice Department ’s inspector general said Thursday that he would open a broad investigation into how the F. B. I. director James B. Comey handled the case over Hillary Clinton ’s emails including his decision to discuss it at a news conference and to disclose 11 days before the election that he had new information that could lead him to reopen it . The inspector general Michael E. Horowitz will not look into the decision not to prosecute Mrs. Clinton or her aides . But he will review actions Mr. Comey took that Mrs. Clinton and many of her supporters believe cost her the election . They are : the news conference in July at which he announced he was not indicting Mrs. Clinton but described her behavior as “ extremely careless ” the letter to Congress in late October in which he said that newly discovered emails could potentially change the outcome of the F. B. I. ’s investigation and the letter three days before the election in which he said that he was closing it again . The inspector general ’s office said that it was initiating the investigation in response to complaints from members of Congress and the public about actions by the F. B. I. and the Justice Department during the campaign that could be seen as politically motivated . For Mr. Comey and the agency he heads the Clinton investigation was politically fraught from the moment the F. B. I. received a referral in July 2015 to determine whether Mrs. Clinton and her aides had mishandled classified information . Senior F. B. I. officials believed there was never going to be a good outcome since it put them in the middle of a bitterly partisan issue . Whatever the decision on whether to charge Mrs. Clinton with a crime Mr. Comey a Republican former Justice Department official appointed by President Obama was going to get hammered . And he was . Republicans who made her use of a private email server a centerpiece of their campaign against Mrs. Clinton attacked Mr. Comey after he decided there was not sufficient evidence she had mishandled classified information to prosecute her . The Clinton campaign believed the F. B. I. investigation was overblown and seriously damaged her chances to win the White House and resented Mr. Comey ’s comments about Mrs. Clinton at his news conference . But the campaign was particularly upset about Mr. Comey ’s two letters which created a wave of damaging news stories at the end of the campaign when Mrs. Clinton and her supporters thought they had put the email issue behind them . In the end the emails that the F. B. I. reviewed — which came up during an unrelated inquiry into Anthony D. Weiner the estranged husband of a top Clinton aide Huma Abedin — proved irrelevant to the investigation ’s outcome . The Clinton campaign said Mr. Comey ’s actions quite likely caused a significant number of undecided voters to cast ballots for Donald J. Trump . F. B. I. officials said Thursday that they welcomed the scrutiny . In a statement Mr. Comey described Mr. Horowitz as “ professional and independent ” and promised to cooperate with his investigation . “ I hope very much he is able to share his conclusions and observations with the public because everyone will benefit from thoughtful evaluation and transparency ” Mr. Comey said .

2.0"WASHINGTON — Seven months ago a respected former British spy named Christopher Steele won a contract to build a file on Donald J. Trump ’s ties to Russia . Last week the explosive details — unsubstantiated accounts of frolics with prostitutes real estate deals that were intended as bribes and coordination with Russian intelligence of the hacking of Democrats — were summarized for Mr. Trump in an appendix to a intelligence report . The consequences have been incalculable and will play out long past Inauguration Day . Word of the summary which was also given to President Obama and congressional leaders leaked to CNN Tuesday and the rest of the media followed with sensational reports . Mr. Trump denounced the unproven claims Wednesday as a fabrication a smear concocted by “ sick people . ” It has further undermined his relationship with the intelligence agencies and cast a shadow over the new administration . Late Wednesday night after speaking with Mr. Trump James R. Clapper Jr . the director of national intelligence issued a statement decrying leaks about the matter and saying of Mr. Steele ’s dossier that the intelligence agencies have “ not made any judgment that the information in this document is reliable . ” Mr. Clapper suggested that intelligence officials had nonetheless shared it to give policy makers “ the fullest possible picture of any matters that might affect national security . ” Parts of the story remain out of reach — most critically the basic question of how much if anything in the dossier is true . But it is possible to piece together a rough narrative of what led to the current crisis including lingering questions about the ties binding Mr. Trump and his team to Russia . The episode also offers a glimpse of the hidden side of presidential campaigns involving private looking for the worst they can find about the next American leader . The story began in September 2015 when a wealthy Republican donor who strongly opposed Mr. Trump put up the money to hire a Washington research firm run by former journalists Fusion GPS to compile a dossier about the real estate magnate ’s past scandals and weaknesses according to a person familiar with the effort . The person described the opposition research work on condition of anonymity
1.0"LONDON — Christopher Steele the former British intelligence agent who prepared the dossier on Donald J. Trump ’s supposed activities in Russia has gone underground . The strange story of the dossier which United States intelligence agencies the F. B. I. Senator John McCain and many journalists have had for weeks if not months and which Mr. Trump presumably must have known about appears to have had personal consequences for Mr. Steele . According to neighbors and news reports Mr. Steele hurriedly left his home in Surrey a county southwest of London on Wednesday to avoid attention or possible retribution once his identity as the author of the dossier was revealed first by The Wall Street Journal . The Journal reported that Mr. Steele had declined its interview requests because the subject was “ too hot . ” Mr. Steele 52 was a longstanding officer with MI6 the British equivalent of the C. I. A. serving in Paris and Moscow in the 1990 s before retiring . In 2009 he started a private research firm Orbis Business Intelligence Ltd. with Christopher Burrows now 58 . Mr. Burrows has refused to confirm or deny that Mr. Steele and Orbis wrote the memos that made up the dossier initially under contract to a Washington firm paid to dig into harmful matters from Mr. Trump ’s past . Mr. Burrows ’s profile page on LinkedIn describes him as a former counselor in the Foreign Office

Instead they heard the jangling music of a feed from RT a Russian television network that has been accused of helping its government interfere in the American election .

" MONTICELLO Iowa — The Table of Knowledge was delving into Donald J. Trump ’s plans to upend government and marveling at how he had forced his fellow Republicans in the House to reverse themselves on gutting the Office of Congressional Ethics . “ He ’s getting responses things are happening ” Jerry Retzlaff a retiree said . “ He got Congress to turn themselves around with one tweet . ” “ There ’s no secret the press doesn ’t like him and neither does a lot of the leadership ” he added . “ And that ’s because he ’s planning on making a lot of changes . ” The eight men around a rectangular table sipping coffee from a hodgepodge of mugs donated by customers meet daily for breakfasts of French toast eggs and bacon at Darrell ’s diner all while solving the world ’s problems hence their gathering ’s nickname . Washington may be veering from one Trump controversy to another : unproved reports of Russia ’s holding embarrassing information against him possible ethical conflicts the donors and billionaires of his cabinet his pushback against intelligence findings on Russian hacking in the election . But there does not seem to be much angst in Iowa among those who voted for Mr. Trump including some Democrats and independents . Monticello in rural eastern Iowa is as close as any place to the epicenter of the political quake that made Mr. Trump president . The state ’s longstanding reputation as a political bellwether had led The New York Times to move me to Iowa for a full year ahead of its presidential caucuses in early 2016 . I had not returned since . In the intervening year Iowa gave Mr. Trump his largest triumph of any battleground state : a reversal over President Obama ’s easy victory here in 2012 . Al Ameling
" On the third day of confirmation hearings on Capitol Hill there was one emerging theme : Many of the nominees of Donald J. Trump have disagreements with him on policy . There were serious questions efforts at diversion with humor and statements by senators . Overall though none of the nominees made any major mistakes and one of them James N. Mattis a retired Marine Corps general was approved as Mr. Trump ’s choice for defense secretary by the Senate Armed Services Committee 24 to 3. Fun fact : He doesn ’t care for the nickname “ Mad Dog . ” ■ Mr. Mattis diverged sharply from his prospective boss on Russia calling Moscow one of the top threats to the world order . “ I ’m all for engagement ” Mr. Mattis said “ but we also have to recognize reality in terms of what Russia is up to . ” ■ Mr. Mattis also put daylight between himself and Mr. Trump on NATO and indicated strong support for the alliance ’s principle of collective defense . “ My view is that nations with allies thrive and nations without allies don’t ” Mr. Mattis said . ■ Mr. Mattis said he supported the Iran nuclear agreement which Mr. Trump has repeatedly criticized . ■ And finally he said that he had no intention of revisiting the Obama administration ’s decisions on social issues at the Defense Department like the opening of combat roles to women . ■ Representative Mike Pompeo the Kansas Republican who is Mr. Trump ’s nominee for director of the C. I. A. said the agency would pursue information about efforts by Russia to interfere with the American election
" WASHINGTON — Ben Carson the nominee for secretary of housing and urban development presented himself on Thursday as a credible manager for a sprawling federal bureaucracy navigating an unlikely transition from celebrated neurosurgeon and genial conservative presidential candidate to the steward of American housing policy . At a Senate confirmation hearing Mr. Carson 65 strained at times to square his past remarks on the dangers of federal assistance — he once called poverty “ really more of a choice than anything else ” — with the mission of the Department of Housing and Urban Development an agency with a $ 47 billion budget and a mandate to help millions of renters and struggling homeowners . Forgoing many specifics he laid out a vision of a more “ holistic ” approach : recruiting private sector dollars and seeking to end what he called a cycle of “ generation after generation of people living in dependent situations . ” “ Safety net programs are important . I would never advocate abolishing them without having an alternative for people to follow ” he said adding that “ some have distorted what I ’ve said about government . ” Yet Americans had come to view HUD ’s mission as “ putting roofs over the heads of poor people ” Mr. Carson said . “ It has the ability to be so much more than that . ” As with his presidential campaign Mr. Carson leaned heavily on his own compelling biography straying frequently from his prepared opening remarks as he spoke of life in an impoverished section of Detroit as the son of a single mother with a education . He waded through several contentious moments including some aimed at his prospective boss Donald J. Trump and the specter of conflicts over HUD funding and Trump family business ventures . But Mr. Carson who was prone to fits of spaciness and occasionally bewildering remarks as a candidate appeared to avoid any major slips on Thursday . The tone of the proceedings diverged sharply from that of hearings this week for Rex W. Tillerson Mr. Trump ’s choice for secretary of state and Senator Jeff Sessions
" Well that sure escalated quickly . “ That ” was Donald J. Trump ’s inaugural news conference as a duly elected United States in which he called BuzzFeed a “ failing pile of garbage ” dismissed CNN as “ fake news ” and more or less told the whole lot of reporters at Trump Tower to stuff it when it comes to his unreleased tax returns because everyday Americans don ’t care and anyway “ I won . ” There were two big lessons in the Wednesday morning melee . 1. Mr. Trump remains a master media manipulator who used his first news briefing since July to expertly delegitimize the news media and make it the story rather than the chaotic swirl of ethical questions that engulf his transition . 2. The news media remains an unwitting accomplice in its own diminishment as it fails to get a handle on how to cover this new and wholly unprecedented president . It better figure things out fast because it has found itself at the edge of the cliff . And our ( fingers crossed ) democracy needs it to stay on the right side of the drop . Journalists should know this by now : Trump ’s gonna Trump . But it ’s time for them to take a page from the playbook — accept the things they cannot change and then find the courage to change the things they can in the right ways not the wrong ways . Given Mr. Trump ’s past behavior there was hardly any doubt that he was going to kneecap his inquisitors on Wednesday . It ’s a passion after all if not a strategic imperative . But BuzzFeed handed him the steel rod hours before with its decision to publish an unvarnished dossier filled with unsubstantiated compromising reports about Mr. Trump allegedly collected by Russian agents presumably for blackmail purposes . BuzzFeed said it was “ publishing the full document so that Americans can make up their own minds about allegations about the that have circulated at the highest levels of the U. S. government . ” Ben Smith the BuzzFeed editor in chief wrote that “ we have always erred on the side of publishing ” and that “ publishing this dossier reflects how we see the job of reporters in 2017 . ” Mr. Smith ’s stated rationale highlights the extent to which WikiLeaks and Gawker which is now defunct have changed the nature of journalism . Both have at times taken a “ publish first fill in the answers — or don ’t — later ” approach
" The bar for scandal in the Trump administration keeps being raised . Every week brings potentially damaging developments that in other contexts could have generated weekslong controversies . With so many competing stories however they are frequently ignored or forgotten . As a result even negative coverage can sometimes benefit Donald J. Trump by displacing potentially more damaging stories from the news agenda . For instance many of Mr. Trump ’s nominees for cabinet positions have faced relatively little scrutiny of their backgrounds or records . Many failed even to complete background checks before the start of Senate hearings a break from decades of precedent . Or consider the case of Monica Crowley an incoming National Security Agency aide found to have engaged in extensive plagiarism in her book ( which Harper Collins pulled from the market ) her Ph. D. dissertation and her Washington Times column . These developments have struggled to gain traction amid the many competing stories about Mr. Trump and his presidential transition including Tuesday night ’s release of unverified allegations against the . Scandals need time and space to develop . When the news cycle is congested potential scandals are deprived of attention causing the media to move on to other stories and the political opposition to anticipate that any criticisms will probably have little effect . Many observers suspect that Mr. Trump seeks to exploit this dynamic by distracting the press and the public with stunts like meeting with Kanye West after delaying a news conference on conflicts of interest or tweeting about Meryl Streep before hearings to consider his nominees on Capitol Hill . It ’s impossible to determine his motivations of course but the effect is often to divert attention from less flattering issues . On Wednesday for instance Mr. Trump ’s news conference on conflict of interest issues was scheduled on the same day as hearings for six nominees . ( After Democrats accused Republicans of scheduling the hearings in part to exploit this dynamic and divert the news media ’s attention some were rescheduled . ) History shows that potential scandals can easily be crowded off the news agenda by other events . During the chaotic period for instance the focus on more important events kept Army Secretary Thomas White in office despite numerous questionable decisions . ( The surge in news continued all the way through the invasion of Iraq in early 2003 helping to insulate George W. Bush from fallout over the collapse of the Enron corporation and other matters Bush didn ’t suffer a major scandal until Valerie Plame was outed as a C. I. A. officer that summer . ) Another example came during the summer of 2009 when the death of Michael Jackson helped push the furor over the affair of the South Carolina governor Mark Sanford out of the news . By contrast
1.0"Good morning . Here ’s what you need to know : • Serious disagreements emerged between Donald J. Trump and some of his nominees in the third day of confirmation hearings . Mr. Trump ’s choice for defense secretary Gen. James N. Mattis said Russia was trying to break NATO . Here ’s where General Mattis stands on other issues . Rex W. Tillerson the choice for secretary of state faces a second round of questions — Wednesday he called for China to be denied access to its artificial islands in the South China Sea . Follow our coverage of the hearings . _____ • The intrigue over a sensational but entirely unverified dossier on Mr. Trump ’s ties to Russia deepened . The who compiled the information disappeared from his home in Britain saying he feared for his safety . Mr. Trump discussed the dossier with James R. Clapper Jr . the director of national intelligence . They had radically different takeaways from the conversation . And the Justice Department said it would investigate the decision by James B. Comey above the F. B. I. chief to inform Congress about a new review in the Hillary Clinton email investigation ahead of the election . _____ • Prosecutors in South Korea are planning to use revelations about a cultural blacklist to strengthen the impeachment charges against President Park . So far two versions of the blacklist have been reported by the news media citing anonymous sources . One version listed more than 9000 people including some of the country ’s most beloved filmmakers actors and writers . Above Hong one of the artists who was reportedly blacklisted . _____ • Japan ’s prime minister Shinzo Abe ended a visit with President Rodrigo Duterte of the Philippines in which he promised the country about $ 8. 7 billion worth of business deals investments and equipment . Mr. Abe is on diplomatic push that will continue with stops in Australia
" WASHINGTON — President Obama said Thursday that he was terminating the policy that has allowed Cubans who arrived on United States soil without visas to remain in the country and gain legal residency an unexpected move long sought by the Cuban government . “ Effective immediately Cuban nationals who attempt to enter the United States illegally and do not qualify for humanitarian relief will be subject to removal consistent with U. S. law and enforcement priorities ” Mr. Obama said in a statement . “ By taking this step we are treating Cuban migrants the same way we treat migrants from other countries . ” The move places a finishing touch on Mr. Obama ’s efforts as president to end a of hostility between the United States and Cuba and to establish normalized relations and diplomatic ties with a government American presidents have long sought to isolate and punish . The action came through a new Department of Homeland Security regulation and a deal with the Cuban government which Mr. Obama said had agreed to accept the return of its citizens . “ What we ’ve agreed to is that the past is past and the future will be different ” said Jeh Johnson the Homeland Security secretary . “ This is us repealing a policy unique to Cuba given the nature of the relationship 20 years ago which is very different right now . ” The “ wet foot dry foot ” policy which dates to 1995 owes its name to its unusual rules which require Cubans caught trying to reach the United States by sea to return home yet allow those who make it onto American soil to stay and eventually apply for legal permanent residency . It was one way in which the United States tried to weaken Fidel Castro ’s government by welcoming tens of thousands of Cubans fleeing repression . In recent years however it has become a magnet for economic refugees enticing many Cubans to make a perilous journey to the United States
" WASHINGTON — Senate Republicans took their first major step toward repealing the Affordable Care Act on Thursday approving a budget blueprint that would allow them to gut the health care law without the threat of a Democratic filibuster . The vote was 51 to 48 . During the roll call Democrats staged a highly unusual protest on the Senate floor to express their dismay and anger at the prospect that millions of Americans could lose health insurance coverage . One by one Democrats rose to voice their objections . Senator Maria Cantwell of Washington said that Republicans were “ stealing health care from Americans . ” Senator Ron Wyden of Oregon said he was voting no “ because health care should not just be for the healthy and wealthy . ” The presiding officer Senator Cory Gardner Republican of Colorado repeatedly banged his gavel and said the Democrats were out of order because “ debate is not allowed during a vote . ” The final vote which ended just before 1:30 a. m. followed a marathon session in which senators took roll call votes on numerous amendments an arduous exercise known as a . The approval of the budget blueprint coming even before Donald J. Trump is inaugurated shows the speed with which Republican leaders are moving to fulfill their promise to repeal President Obama ’s signature domestic policy achievement — a goal they believe can now be accomplished after Mr. Trump ’s election . The action by the Senate is essentially procedural setting the stage for a special kind of legislation called a reconciliation bill . Such a bill can be used to repeal significant parts of the health law and critically is immune from being filibustered . Congress appears to be at least weeks away from voting on legislation repealing the law . Republicans say the 2016 elections gave them a mandate to roll back the health care law . “ The Obamacare bridge is collapsing and we ’re sending in a rescue team ” said Senator Michael B. Enzi Republican of Wyoming and the chairman of the Senate Budget Committee . “ Then we ’ll build new bridges to better health care and finally when these new bridges are finished we ’ll close the old bridge . ” Republican leaders say they will work closely with Mr. Trump developing legislation to repeal and replace the health care law but it is unclear exactly how his team will participate in that effort . On Wednesday
" As a candidate back in July 2015 Donald J. Trump promised that he would repeal Obamacare and replace it with “ something terrific . ” The Senate voted 51 to 48 on Thursday morning for a measure setting Congress on the path toward repealing President Obama ’s health care law and Mr. Trump is now a few days from taking office . The public however knows little more about his proposal than it did in 2015 . In comments to The New York Times on Tuesday and in his news conference on Wednesday Mr. Trump described when a Republican health reform bill would be released — “ very quickly . ” But he has yet to give details about the policies it would contain . “ We ’re going to have a health care that is far less expensive and far better ” he said Wednesday . Mr. Trump accurately describes problems with the current health care system for Americans under 65 : “ You have deductibles that are so high that after people go broke paying their premiums which are going through the roof the health care can ’t even be used by them because their deductibles bills are so high . ” Mitch McConnell the Senate majority leader and House Speaker Paul Ryan have also spoken forcefully in recent days about how health care is too expensive . Premiums for health insurance plans in the United States are high . And increasing deductibles can make needed coverage a financial stretch even for the insured . Recent polling from the nonpartisan Kaiser Family Foundation suggests that the public agrees with Mr. Trump ’s assessment : High spending on health care is Americans ’ No. 1 health care concern . ( Mr. Trump has promised that he will not make major changes to Medicare the program for Americans 65 and older . ) But solving those problems is not as easy as identifying them . The real reason health care premiums and deductibles are so high is that medical care is very expensive in the United States — far more costly than it is anywhere else in the world . The United States pays very high prices to doctors and hospitals and drug and device makers and Americans use a lot of that expensive medical care . That means that the country spent far more on health care than its peers even when tens of millions of Americans lacked health coverage . Obamacare has been successful in getting health insurance to people who lacked it before . About 20 million more Americans had insurance last year than before the law passed according to an Obama administration estimate . But the health law largely focused on health insurance regulation did not drive down the cost of medical treatments . Health care and health insurance continues to be expensive . That means that a Republican health reform plan that is both cheaper and better than Obamacare will be hard to deliver . Republicans in Congress and think tanks have put together a number of possible Obamacare replacement plans . They are all slightly different and it is unclear which one Mr. Trump and congressional leaders will choose . But none of them solve both sides of the “ less expensive and far better ” equation . Most of the G. O. P. plans manage to be less expensive for the federal government — by offering stingier federal payments in helping people buy insurance and allowing the coverage people buy to be skimpier . But those proposals will tend to increase
" The Season 7 “ Real Housewives of New Jersey ” reunion show took place in October in a theater in Westbury N. Y. An elaborate thing had been constructed on a stage that would soon seat the five Housewives complete with a rug and zebra chairs everything sparkling everything . The set was erected so specifically and thoroughly that it included a kitchen in the back unusable but complete that you could see only a fraction of and a fireplace that the cameras would never pick up . “ That ’s not a real fireplace ? ” I asked a production assistant who answered “ It ’s not not real . ” The five contracted Housewives arrived on Long Island the night before for this reckoning of the season ’s tensions equal parts State of the State panel discussion and of every lunchtime confrontation that occurred at my high school . The Housewives were shuttled in black S. U. V.s under the cover of darkness to a hotel more than two hours from where they live in order to “ throw off the scent to the press ” a publicist told me though “ scent ” is a strange word choice here because anyone with a nose could have the place from the sheer concentration of applied Shalimar . But there was good reason for the secrecy . Leaks from these reunion shows have been rampant and after a previous one Andy Cohen the mediator and the franchise creator ( or as he says “ the person who gets credit for creating the franchise ” when really a lot of other people were involved ) realized that the leaks might be coming from the hair and makeup teams who watch the live feed from a holding room . He told the producers to cut the audio to those dressing rooms . Since then
" Working out only on the weekends or otherwise compressing your total physical activity into one or two prolonged runs or a single vigorous basketball or soccer game each week could lessen your risks of dying prematurely almost as effectively as more frequent shorter workouts spread throughout the week according to an interesting new study of the weekend warrior phenomenon . As most of us have heard by now the standard recommendation about how much exercise we should complete each week for health purposes is 150 minutes of moderate or 75 minutes of vigorous physical activity . Moderate exercise consists of activities like brisk walking or easy cycling that raise heart rates while still allowing us to talk to training partners and vigorous activities are those like running cycling and many team sports including basketball and soccer that raise heart rates into a zone where speaking is difficult . Meeting these guidelines is associated with a substantially reduced risk of developing a wide range of diseases and dying too young . The guidelines also suggest that for practical purposes people consider breaking the 150 minutes into five moderate sessions each week or a comparable number of shorter more vigorous workouts . But many people apparently do not have the time or inclination to exercise five times per week . About a third of American adults engage in zero weekly exercise and others pack their workouts into one or two sessions on Saturday or Sunday when they have more free time . There has been little information though about whether the weekend warrior pattern of exercise lowers the risk for premature death as effectively as more frequent and generally shorter workouts . So for the new study which was published on Monday in JAMA Internal Medicine researchers at Loughborough University in England and other institutions decided to delve into the exercise routines of tens of thousands of men and women already participating in the Health Survey for England and the Scottish Health Survey . The researchers zeroed in on data from 63591 men and women who had provided detailed descriptions of their workout patterns when they first entered the study at least 15 years before telling the survey questioners how many minutes they had exercised each week during the past month what kinds of exercise they had undertaken and how many times per week they had worked out . The researchers used that data to categorize the men and women into a variety of groups . Those who never exercised were defined
" I ’m always thrilled when a certain former drinking buddy comes to see me at the bar . He stopped drinking alcohol years ago but he ’s as fun to be around as he was when we sat side by side at a corner bar in TriBeCa many nights in the ’90s — probably more so . Quitting drinking whether it ’s for a month ( as many are tempted to do this time of year ) or forever shouldn ’t have to mean forgoing all the other and arguably deeper pleasures of bar culture : community and conversation . Of course it ’s easier — and maybe economically sounder — to drink at home but we go to bars because other people are there and the fellowship we find with them is for many of us more important than the pints and shots . I want my friend to be as happy and relaxed at the bar as any other customer and he deserves something better than a cranberry and seltzer . Given the limited resources at my small neighborhood pub a virgin bloody mary usually does the trick — and mixed with a good nonalcoholic beer it makes an excellent base for a virgin michelada too . Cocktail and restaurant bars are also making a greater effort to make nondrinkers feel welcome and well looked after . Some have dedicated nonalcoholic drink menus . On the list at Boston ’s Bar Mezzana is a festive number called the Orchid Thief fragrant with orange and tinged with vanilla fizzed up with club soda and served in a flute — a celebratory glassful of bubbly . Abigail Gullo at Compère Lapin in New Orleans gladly accommodates nondrinkers with a cooler composed of fresh blackberries citrus juices and orgeat an almondy syrup that hints at the flavor of amaretto . Another creative bartender the Los Gabriella Mlynarczyk has deliberately developed recipes that are delicious and satisfying with or without alcohol . One is the Mumbai Mule
" SEOUL South Korea — When the South Korean artist Hong produced a painting that depicted President Park as a scarecrow manipulated by evil forces including her dictator father her senior aides discussed how to “ punish ” Mr. Hong according to a diary one of them kept . Soon after the painting ’s completion in August 2014 the retaliation began as planned in the aide ’s diary which surfaced in November in the investigation into the corruption scandal that has led to Ms. Park ’s impeachment trial . First a civic group sued Mr. Hong on charges of defaming Ms. Park . Then his work was excluded from the Gwangju Biennale South Korea ’s international arts festival an act Gwangju ’s mayor later admitted was due to government pressure . The retaliation did not stop there Mr. Hong said . “ Dozens of conservative activists showed up in front of my apartment like a goon squad shaking my photographs and calling me a ‘ Communist painter ’ ” he said . “ I received death threats on the phone . ” As it turned out Mr. Hong was one of thousands of artists reportedly blacklisted by the government of Ms. Park whose powers have been suspended as she faces an impeachment trial on charges of corruption and abuse of power . The blacklist is just one element in the sprawling case that has infuriated the public and prompted national introspection about South Korea ’s young democracy and its authoritarian past . On Thursday three of Ms. Park ’s former aides including one of her former culture ministers Kim were arrested on charges of blacklisting cultural figures deemed unfriendly and barring them from support programs . So far two versions of the blacklist have been reported by the news media citing anonymous sources . Officials including the special prosecutor in the case
" BALTIMORE — Nearly two years after the death of a black man in police custody led to violent riots here the Justice Department and city leaders announced on Thursday a agreement to impose greater oversight and training on a police force found to have routinely harassed minorities . Negotiators have been rushing for weeks to complete the deal before the Jan. 20 inauguration of Donald J. Trump and the expected confirmation of his attorney general pick Senator Jeff Sessions . Both men are seen as hostile to police oversight agreements like the one put in place on Thursday with Mr. Trump denouncing what he called the “ war on police ” during his presidential campaign . Justice Department negotiators are moving quickly to complete a second investigation in Chicago which has also been wracked by violence and tension between the police and residents . The findings of that investigation could come as early as Friday . Announcing the Baltimore deal at City Hall Attorney General Loretta E. Lynch said she was confident that the reforms mandated by the deal would take hold even if the Trump administration were to take steps to try to undo it . “ This agreement is binding and it will live on ” said Ms. Lynch flanked by Mayor Catherine Pugh Police Commissioner Kevin Davis Vanita Gupta the head of the civil rights division at the Justice Department and others . Mr. Davis said the pact provides “ a path forward ” that he said will benefit both his officers and the city ’s residents and that it should serve as a model for thousands of other police departments in tackling tensions . Baltimore came under Justice Department scrutiny after an man Freddie Gray 25 died of a spinal cord injury he received while in police custody in 2015 as he was being transported in a department van . The death led to widespread protests — Gov. Larry Hogan a Republican called in the National Guard to quell riots — and appeals for federal intervention . In the ensuing political fallout the Democratic mayor Stephanie dismissed the police chief and six officers were charged in Mr. Gray ’s death none were convicted . The episode roiled racial tensions nationwide amid a string of other deaths of black men in police confrontations nationwide from Ferguson Mo . to Staten Island . The Justice Department filed a consent decree in federal court on Thursday just minutes before announcing the deal . A judge must approve it before the city and the Police Department begin putting in place more than a dozen changes
" KABUL Afghanistan — A United States military investigation into claims of civilian casualties during a joint operation by Afghan and American forces found that 33 civilians were killed and 27 others were wounded during a firefight and airstrikes in Kunduz Province last year American military officials said on Thursday . In early November Afghan Special Forces accompanied by American military advisers came under intense fire during an operation to arrest Taliban commanders in Boz Qandahari a village in Kunduz the United States military command in Afghanistan said in a statement . They called in American airstrikes which resulted in some of the civilian casualties . Two American soldiers and three Afghan commandos were killed and four American soldiers and 11 commandos were wounded the statement said . “ Regardless of the circumstances I deeply regret the loss of innocent lives ” said Gen. John W. Nicholson Jr . the commander of United States forces in Afghanistan . “ On this occasion the Taliban chose to hide amongst civilians and then attacked Afghan and U. S. forces . ” “ I wish to assure President Ghani and the people of Afghanistan that we will take all possible measures to protect Afghan civilians ” he added referring to Ashraf Ghani . After the battle in Kunduz a New York Times reporter counted 22 bodies being brought into the city on the way to the hospital there . Among them were 14 children four women two older men and two men of fighting age . They were accompanied by a large group of protesters from Boz Qandahari the village that was hit .

" The awards season leaders whom everyone already knew were awards season leaders became ever more apparent on Thursday when the Directors Guild of America revealed the nominees for its top prize . They are : Damien Chazelle ( “ La La Land ” ) Garth Davis ( “ Lion ” ) Barry Jenkins ( “ Moonlight ” ) Kenneth Lonergan ( “ Manchester by the Sea ” ) and Denis Villeneuve ( “ Arrival ” ) . The real news came further down in the announcement : Nate Parker received a nomination for outstanding achievement for a director . This signals a redemption of sorts for Mr. Parker whose awards hopes for his debut film “ The Birth of a Nation ” were torpedoed when controversy emerged around rape charges he faced and was acquitted of nearly 16 years ago . In the category nominations also went to Mr. Davis ( a second one for his work on “ Lion ” ) Kelly Fremon Craig ( “ Edge of Seventeen ” ) Dan Trachtenberg ( “ 10 Cloverfield Lane ” ) and Tim Miller whose satirical superhero film “ Deadpool ” has been a surprise presence in this year ’s awards race . In the main feature film category the notable omissions were Mel Gibson for “ Hacksaw Ridge ” and Martin Scorsese whose passion project “ Silence ” received neither a Directors Guild nomination nor one from the Producers Guild which found room for “ Deadpool ” in its nominations list this week . Taken with the film ’s shutout from the Screen Actors Guild Award nominations Mr. Scorsese and “ Silence ” are all but guaranteed to be ignored in the best picture and best director Oscar races this year . ( Academy Award nominations are announced Jan. 24 . ) Guild awards are given far more weight in the Oscars race than awards from critics or journalists because they represent industry sentiment and because a huge number of guild members also belong to the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences . The DGA Award nominations capped a busy week that began with the Golden Globes and included nomination announcements from the producers and the British Academy of Film and Television Arts which also shares members with the American academy ( and is now dealing with a #BAFTASoWhite controversy for picking an slate of lead acting and directing nominees ) . Taken with Golden Globes wins the guild nominations make clear the calcification of this year ’s race around the leading contenders with “ La La Land ” more out front than ever . "
" WASHINGTON — President Obama surprised Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr . on Thursday by bestowing the Presidential Medal of Freedom on him calling Mr. Biden “ my brother ” in a tearful goodbye in the East Room of the White House . Having called Mr. Biden and his wife Jill to the White House for a private farewell the president instead brought him into a room filled with his friends family and colleagues to present him with the honor the nation ’s highest . For the first time Mr. Obama awarded the medal with distinction an added level of veneration that previous presidents had reserved for recipients like Pope John Paul II and Colin L. Powell the former secretary of state . “ To know Joe Biden is to know love without pretense service without and to live life fully ” Mr. Obama said during the televised ceremony as Mr. Biden wiped tears from his eyes and dabbed at his nose with a handkerchief . Moments later as the president called up a military aide to read the proclamation Mr. Biden appeared to break down turning his back to the audience to compose himself . After Mr. Obama hung the medal around his neck the vice president cried openly . “ Ricchetti you ’re fired ” Mr. Biden joked to his chief of staff Steve Ricchetti . “ I had no inkling . ” Addressing Mr. Obama who stood to his side
" Let ’s just get this out of the way shall we ? Ayelet Waldman : intemperate tweeter guerrilla oversharer provocateur literary exhibitionist cyclone of sass . When The New York Times Book Review didn ’t select her novel “ Love and Treasure ” as one of its 100 Notable Books of 2014 she unleashed a tweetstorm of hurt . ( excerpt : “ there are MANY books on that notable list with reviews that were NOWHERE near as good as mine . ” ) When she announced in a 2005 essay that she loved her husband the novelist Michael Chabon more than she loved her children outraged mothers everywhere clucked and and when she expressed surprise the chorus came back — Well what on earth did you expect ?

" PARIS — In a surprise verdict a French tribunal of judges cleared Guy Wildenstein — the patriarch of an international dynasty — of charges that he laundered money by shielding a precious collection in a maze of foreign trusts to avoid inheritance taxes . Olivier Géron the lead judge who had presided over the trial last fall announced the decision Thursday at the Palais de Justice . He spent an hour reading a ruling that he acknowledged could seem to “ defy common sense ” because Mr. Wildenstein and his family had demonstrated a “ clear intention ” to conceal their wealth over generations . But their behavior the decision said fell into a gray area before France enacted legislation in 2011 to require the declaration of foreign trusts . The authorities had sought a 250 million euro fine ( about $ 267 million ) for Mr. Wildenstein 71 who is president of Wildenstein Company a New York art gallery . The case also ensnared his nephew and his estranged along with Swiss and French legal advisers and foreign trust companies . They were cleared as well — a defeat for a relatively new prosecution unit that had been created to combat international tax evasion . Monica d’Onofrio the prosecutor had demanded severe punishment for Mr. Wildenstein including prison time calling the family ’s financial operations “ the longest and the most sophisticated tax fraud ” in contemporary France . The French media had also labeled the Wildensteins the “ impressionists of finance ” a reference to the family ’s deep collection of art which included works by Bonnard Fragonard Caravaggio Poussin and Watteau . Mr. Wildenstein was not in court for the verdict . But his lawyer Hervé Temime said he had called the art dealer and he was “ relieved ” by the outcome . Mr. Wildenstein ’s legal team had argued at trial that he was unaware of the complex terms of the trusts managed by legal advisers . Mr. Wildenstein was accused of underestimating inheritance taxes after his father Daniel
" A few hours after her father ’s news conference on Wednesday at Trump Tower Ivanka Trump posted a notice on her personal Facebook page officially announcing that she was taking a “ formal leave of absence ” from all management and operative responsibilities at her fashion brand and that she would be stepping down from her role at the Trump Organization . She would she wrote be spending the next few months concentrating on settling her children into their new lives in Washington and exploring how she could “ determine the most impactful and appropriate ways for me to serve our country . ” This follows earlier decisions to separate her personal social media accounts from those of her brand . Yet in one meaningful area Ms. Trump and her brand are harder to divide : That is her wardrobe . After all the same day she announced she was separating Ivanka Trump the person from Ivanka Trump the brand The Daily Mail announced she had worn an Ivanka Trump coat to her father ’s news conference . Then it offered a box and link . In case you know anyone wanted to buy the garment . That turned out not to be true — according to a spokesman for Ms. Trump the coat was by Joseph Altuzarra — but the confusion around woman and product made for some uncomfortable optics and it raises the question : What does it mean to separate individual from company where fashion is concerned ? On the one hand there ’s something ridiculous about suggesting that Ms. Trump not wear whatever clothes are in her closet and as the founder of a fashion brand that bears her name presumably part of her job has been to promote said brand by wearing it — to in effect demonstrate her belief in her own products . So she probably has a lot of such products within reach . And it ’s not her fault if some media outlet chooses to point out that she looks good and tells people how they too can look good . On the other hand her brand is clearly built on her image : Not just her name but her face
" You would be to find someone more devoted to the Cleveland Browns than Jeff Stemler . He exulted over the wins . After losses he was so angry that he couldn ’t speak . The team was part of his identity . It started in his childhood when the quarterback Brian Sipe led the Browns to improbable victories . As an adult Mr. Stemler became a holder . He cried when the team moved to Baltimore in 1995 and he found love again when the National Football League awarded Cleveland with a new Browns franchise in 1998 . But somehow after hundreds of Sundays at the stadium or in the television glow it all came to an end . It wasn ’t because the Browns were bad necessarily . It was something else . Something deeper . Mr. Stemler a landscape supplies salesman in Columbus Ohio pinpoints the moment to a Sunday in October 2014 when the Browns thumped the Pittsburgh Steelers . As giddy fans spoke of a new era in Cleveland Mr. Stemler felt nothing . “ Is this really what makes me happy ? ” he asked himself . “ Everyone is going nuts and I ’m just kind of sitting there ” Mr. Stemler added . “ I remember this guy looking at me and asking : ‘ What ’s wrong ? Why aren ’t you excited ? ’ ” The strange feeling did not go away . “ I think I have gotten to a point in my life where I need to let things go that don ’t bring me enjoyment ” he said . “ I think as you get older you realize you don ’t hang on to things that don ’t bring you joy . If it ’s not making me happy then why do it ? Don ’t just do it because you feel like you should be doing it . That ’s what I was doing — I was going up every Sunday for the Browns and I was dreading it . ” Most fans develop a bond with a team as children . For reasons that may go unquestioned they stick with it

" WASHINGTON — The House cleared the way on Friday for speedy action to repeal the Affordable Care Act putting Congress on track to undo the most significant health care law in a . With a near vote of 227 to 198 the House overcame the opposition of Democrats and the anxieties of some Republicans to approve a budget blueprint that allows Republicans to end major provisions of President Obama ’s health care law without the threat of a Democratic filibuster in the Senate . Donald J. Trump Speaker Paul D. Ryan and other Republican leaders now face a much bigger challenge : devising their own plan to ensure broad access to health care and coverage while controlling costs . While their party is far from a consensus on how to replace the health care law — under which more than 20 million Americans have gained health insurance — they will need votes from Democrats in the Senate to enact a robust replacement plan . Republicans have argued that Americans have been crushed by soaring premiums and other unintended effects of the law which was adopted without any Republican votes . “ This is a critical first step toward delivering relief to Americans who are struggling under this law ” Mr. Ryan said adding “ This experiment has failed . ” Democrats warned that repeal of the health law would cause hardship for millions of Americans and create chaos in insurance markets and in the health care system which accounts for about 18 percent of the nation ’s economy . “ If we go down this path we won ’t have repeal and replace ” said Representative John Yarmuth of Kentucky the senior Democrat on the House Budget Committee . “ What we ’ll have is repeal and repent because we ’re going to owe a huge apology to the American people for the damage that we cause . ” Representative Suzan DelBene of Washington a Democrat said “ There ’s still no plan for what comes next threatening massive disruption to the entire health care system . ” In the days before the House vote some conservative Republicans as well as moderates expressed discomfort about signing off on the budget blueprint without having a clearer picture of how and when Republican leaders planned to replace the health care law . Nine House Republicans ended up voting against the budget measure on Friday . No Democrats voted for it . The Senate approved the same measure early Thursday by a vote of 51 to 48 . The House and Senate votes this week — essentially procedural steps — represented the first of several moves that Republicans plan to make as they work to unwind the health care law . In the coming weeks they say they will try to devise a replacement
" It looks like the beginning of the end for Obamacare as we know it . After years of vowing to repeal the Affordable Care Act as it is formally known Republican lawmakers in both chambers of Congress have now passed a bill that will make it easier to gut the law . Because they are using a special budget process Republicans won ’t be able to repeal all provisions of the health law . But it seems like a good time to look at the major changes Obamacare brought to health care which of those changes may now disappear and what might replace them . An important note : We still don ’t know the details of a repeal bill and passage is not guaranteed . But Republicans passed a similar package in 2015 vetoed by President Obama that provides a rough template . Republicans have also said they hope to make further changes through additional legislation . We ’ll provide updates when new legislative language arrives expected in several weeks . The health law reduced the number of uninsured Americans by an estimated 20 million people from 2010 to 2016 . One of the primary ways it did so was by creating online markets where people who didn ’t get insurance through work or the government could shop for a health plan from a private insurer . The law offered subsidies for Americans with lower incomes to help pay their premiums and deductibles . What would happen ? The Republican bill is expected to eliminate the subsidies . This would make insurance unaffordable for millions of Americans and sharply reduce the number who buy their own health coverage . With many fewer people buying coverage the insurance markets are likely to become increasingly unstable . Many insurers will stop offering policies and the remaining customers are likely to be sicker than current Obamacare buyers a reality that will drive up the cost of insurance for everyone who buys it and force more people out of the markets . The Urban Institute estimates that the change would cause a total of 22 . 5 million people to lose their health insurance . What might replace it ? Separate legislation may include some new form of subsidy to help people afford insurance . Plans from House Speaker Paul Ryan and the budget committee chairman Tom Price Donald J. Trump ’s pick to lead the Department of Health and Human Services would both offer a flat tax credit to help buy insurance that varies by age . A proposal from the House Republican Study Committee would give all Americans a standard tax deduction to buy insurance . The health law provided federal funds for states to offer Medicaid coverage to anyone earning less than about $ 16 000 for a single person or $ 33 000 for a family of four . Not every state chose to expand but most did . What would happen ? The Republican plan is expected to eliminate federal funding for the expansion . An estimated 12 . 9 million people would lose Medicaid coverage according to the Urban Institute ’s projections . What might replace it ? Republican leaders have discussed reforming the remaining Medicaid program to give states more autonomy and to reduce future federal investment . One of the law ’s signature features prevents insurance companies from denying coverage or charging a higher price to someone with a health problem . The law included a host of other protections for all health plans : a ban on setting a lifetime limit on how much an insurer has to pay to cover someone a requirement that insurers offer a minimum package of benefits a guarantee that preventive health services be covered without a a cap on insurance company profits and limits on how much more insurers can charge older people than younger people . The law also required insurance plans to allow adult children to stay on their parents ’ policies until age 26 . What would happen ? These rules can ’t be changed using the special budget process

Kislyak the Russian ambassador to the United States the day before President Obama imposed sanctions on Russia for election hacking to arrange a phone call between President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia and Mr. Trump once he becomes president a Trump spokesman said Friday . Mr. Flynn ’s secret call did not violate the law Mr. Trump ’s spokesman said . But under the circumstances it is bound to raise eyebrows . “ The call centered around the logistics of setting up a call with the president of Russia and the after he was sworn in and they exchanged logistical information ” Sean Spicer Mr. Trump ’s spokesman told reporters on a conference call on Friday . “ That was it plain and simple . ” Several news organizations reported on Thursday on the calls between the two men . David Ignatius of The Washington Post suggested it could have violated the Logan Act a law that bars American citizens from negotiating without authorization with foreign governments that have a dispute with the United States . Mr. Spicer said General Flynn had initially reached out to Mr. Kislyak via text message on Christmas Day to wish him a happy holiday and to say that he looked forward to working with him in the coming administration . The ambassador sent a text back returning the sentiment he added . The Russian envoy followed up on Dec. 28 with another text that asked if he could call General Flynn and the two spoke Mr. Spicer said . The call
" Steve Harvey the comedian and television host became the latest celebrity to ascend Trump Tower on Friday to discuss federal policy with Donald Trump in this case housing issues . But before Mr. Harvey was off the premises he unexpectedly revived a recent controversy over his comments about Asian men . After the meeting Mr. Trump and Mr. Harvey briefly appeared together in the lobby . When Mr. Trump left Mr. Harvey said they had discussed ways he could work with Ben Carson Mr. Trump ’s nominee to run the Department of Housing and Urban Development . Mr. Harvey has spoken openly in the past of being homeless as an adult while struggling to start his comedy career though he gave no reason on Friday for why he was consulted on housing affairs . Mr. Harvey said he was invited a week ago by “ both transition teams ” referring to representatives of President Obama and Mr. Trump and emphasized that the visit was informal . “ Well you know it ’s not my jump into politics ” Mr. Harvey said . “ I ain ’t gonna pass a background check . It ’s just me following orders from my friend President Obama who said ‘ Steve you gotta ’ as he told everybody ‘ get out from behind your computer stop tweeting and texting and get out there and sit down and talk . ’ ” The Trump team confirmed the invitation . The White House did not comment . Mr. Harvey announced his support for Mr. Trump ’s opponent Hillary Clinton last March in the presidential primaries . In September during an interview with her on “ The Steve Harvey Morning Show ” on iHeartRadio
" Jennifer Holliday sang for the Reagans . She sang for the Bushes ( father and son ) . And she sang for the Clintons . So when the planners of this year ’s presidential inauguration reached out to the singer this week to ask if she would sing during a welcome concert the day before Donald J. Trump is to be sworn in as president she said yes . “ I ’m singing on the mall for the people ” she said . “ I don ’t have a dog in this fight — I ’m just a singer and it ’s a welcome concert for the people on the mall . ” Ms. Holliday speaking during a telephone interview Friday afternoon said she had not supported Mr. Trump ’s candidacy — “ I voted for Mrs. Clinton and they knew that . ” But she said “ if someone wants me to sing a national anthem or something we think about America and we go . ” Ms. Holliday sounded certain about her choice but her spokesman William Carpenter suggested in a subsequent email that the decision was not set in stone . “ I just spoke to her and she still hadn ’t made up her mind about doing the event ” he wrote . Ms. Holliday is a Broadway icon renowned for her performance as Effie in the original cast of “ Dreamgirls ” and she returned to Broadway this season as a replacement Shug Avery in the revival of “ The Color Purple . ” The final performance of that show was Sunday and the Clintons were in the audience . Ms. Holliday said she was asked on Wednesday if she would sing at the concert scheduled for Jan. 19 and she agreed seeing the request as similar to those she received to sing at the White House during past Republican and Democratic presidencies . “ I just thought of the history part of it and about singing on the mall where Marian Anderson paved the way for me to sing as a black American

" Good morning . ( Want to get California Today by email ? Here ’s the . ) Let ’s turn it over to Adam Nagourney our Los Angeles bureau chief for today ’s introduction . LOS ANGELES — And on Thursday it rained . Again . The arrival of another winter rain here a wet end to a week that began with heavy snows in the Sierra Nevada has begged a welcome question : Is the drought that punished California for six years over ? No question California has turned a corner . There was more rain in Los Angeles in December than since the drought began for better and worse . The rain this week shut down Laurel Canyon Boulevard after the waterlogged porch of a house collapsed into the roadway and flash flood warnings were issued in Los Angeles as storms swept back and forth across the area on Thursday evening . In Northern California the storms produced extensive flooding in Sonoma County and around Sacramento — among the parts of the state . Ski resorts reported that 12 feet of snow fell in Tahoe . Mudslides closed Interstate 80 as the storm passed through Sierra Nevada . At least five people have died officials said . Reservoirs that were parched last year are close to capacity . The snowpack — which keeps the water flowing into the early summer as the snow melts — is 161 percent of normal . The United States Drought Monitor for this week reported that 42 percent of the state was out of drought conditions compared with 3 percent last year . “ In terms of surface water most of California is no longer in drought ” wrote Jay Lund the director of the Center for Watershed Sciences at the University of California in Davis . Still winter is not even half over . Many years have started off wet and gone completely dry . Climate change has produced higher temperatures which could melt away the snowpack before summer . And parts of the state remain dry . But after six years of mandatory conservation orders there seems reason for celebration . “ This series of storms has done more than make a dent in the drought which is a huge relief ” said Felicia Marcus the head of the State Water Resources Control Board . “ But it ’s a little early to have a drought ’s over party . ” ( Please note : We regularly highlight articles on news sites that have limited access for nonsubscribers . ) • Congratulations Los Angeles on getting the Chargers .

" It happened one night in the late summer of 1954 . Jules Schulback a New York furrier and taker of home movies heard that Marilyn Monroe would be on the Upper East Side of Manhattan filming scenes again for her new picture “ The Seven Year Itch . ” Two days earlier Mr. Schulback had taken footage of her with his Bolex movie camera around the corner from his townhouse apartment . So he grabbed the camera — the one usually used for family picnics and parades and the stuff of everyday life — and headed over to the subway grate in front of Wright ’s Food shop just down the street from the movie theater on Lexington Avenue and 52nd Street . Though it was around 1 a. m. a large crowd had already gathered mostly newspaper photographers and curious men waiting to see Marilyn . The movie studio and the director Billy Wilder had counted on this inviting the press and the public to drum up buzz for the new movie which starred Ms. Monroe as “ the Girl Upstairs ” who entices a executive played by Tom Ewell while his wife is away with the kids for the summer . In the famous street scene the two are leaving the movies as Ms. Monroe pauses over a grate to enjoy the breeze from the subway as it blows up her dress on a hot summer night . “ Isn ’t it delicious ? ” she purrs . The breeze came from a large fan under the grate operated by the film ’s special effects chief . The night — Sept. 15 — was actually quite chilly . But the stunt worked . It became known as “ the shot seen around the world . ” But there was a dark subtext to the comedy . Gathered at that late hour were hundreds of gawkers almost all men who catcalled and yelled things like “ Higher ! Higher ! ” as Ms. Monroe ’s dress blew up over her head . For two hours the men watched from surrounding buildings and from the street . “ Unfortunately one of them was her husband Joe DiMaggio
" HONG KONG — At the Addiction Treatment Center in eastern China more than 6000 internet addicts — most of them teenagers — not only had their web access taken away they were also treated with electroshock therapy . The center in Shandong Province made headlines in September after one of its patients killed her mother in retribution for abuse she had purportedly suffered at the camp during a forced detox regimen . Now China is trying to regulate camps like the one in Shandong which have become a last resort for parents exasperated by their child ’s habit of playing online games for hours on end . The government has drafted a law that would crack down on the camps ’ worst excesses including electroshock and other “ physical punishments . ” Medical specialists welcomed the law announced this week in China ’s news media as an initial step toward curbing scandals in the industry . “ It ’s a very important move for protecting young children ” said Tao Ran the director of the Internet Addiction Clinic at Beijing Military General Hospital . Dr. Tao said that many Chinese parents believe that the effects of electroshock therapy are fleeting . But he had seen several Chinese teenagers return from boot camps that treat internet addiction showing signs of lasting psychological trauma he said . “ They didn ’t talk were afraid to meet people and refused to leave their homes ” he said referring to his meetings with the teenagers . “ They were panicked even to hear the word ‘ hospital ’ and ‘ doctor . ’ ” Qu Xinjiu a law professor at China University of Political Science and Law in Beijing said the belief that parents have supreme jurisdiction over their children and that even police officers have no right to intervene in family affairs is widespread in China . “ That ’s why there are so many parents sending their kids for electroshock therapy even when outsiders think it ’s wrong to do so

" The hunt for the people behind Volkswagen ’s emissions scandal did not end with the company ’s plea bargain this week . There was the man identified in court documents only as “ Supervisor B ” who overruled nervous subordinates and told them to develop the illegal software . Don ’t get caught he told them according to the documents . There was “ Attorney A ” who as regulators closed in urged to destroy any emails that mentioned the “ acoustic function ” the code name for emissions cheating software . The two suspects were conspicuously missing from the group of six Volkswagen executives indicted on Wednesday — a clear indication that there could be more criminal charges further eroding the company ’s reputation and destabilizing management . There is little doubt that investigators will lean on suspects to testify against others and push as high up in Volkswagen ’s organization chart as the evidence allows . The $ 20 billion that Volkswagen is paying to resolve civil and criminal charges — including obstruction of justice and conspiracy to defraud the United States government — is unlikely to be the end of the story . Even as the settlement removed a major source of uncertainty for the company other cases loom . Shareholder lawsuits in the United States and Europe could cost an additional $ 10 billion . United States authorities also signaled that investigators will not be constrained by national boundaries . Five of the six people indicted on Wednesday are believed to be in Germany . The cost of the United States settlements drains cash that Volkswagen urgently needs to adapt to technological upheaval . cars services and other innovations are expected to upend the industry . The settlement “ is an important step that will help Volkswagen to win back trust in the United States ” said Ferdinand Dudenhöffer a professor at the University of . But the cost he said “ will set back Volkswagen ’s plans and in my opinion require cuts in investment in the United States . ” Volkswagen clearly hoped the settlement would be the turning point that allows it to begin rebuilding its shattered reputation . The company issued publicity photographs this week of a shiny replacement for the blue and white “ VW ” logo that for decades has stood like a giant hood ornament atop Volkswagen ’s executive offices in its hometown Wolfsburg . “ Volkswagen deeply regrets the behavior that gave rise to the diesel crisis ” Matthias Müller its chief executive said in a statement . “ Since all of this came to light
" Friday caps a wildly busy week especially out of Washington . There was Donald Trump ’s news conference . There was the dossier on Trump and Russia . And then there were the confirmation hearings for the ’s cabinet nominations . One of the nominees Jeff Sessions for attorney general was described in a Times profile leading up to the hearings as having Christian values . “ Mr. Sessions ” the profile said “ offers an uncompromising brand of conservatism that combines Christian and values with strains of populism and a willingness to say the unpopular or even offensive . ” That description drew fire from several readers . The public editor ’s take : I contacted the writers Sharon LaFraniere and Matt Apuzzo to ask about their intent . Both wanted to assure readers that they were not trying to use Christian values as a for any specific policies . They also said they weren ’t trying to assert whether he lives a good Christian life only that he is a devout Methodist who views his religion a guiding factor . Seems reasonable . I do appreciate however that the phrase used in this way could be seen as equating Sessions ’ views to those of all Christians . It implies a universality to “ Christian values ” in a way that might offend Christians who don ’t share them . Also in the news this week was that unsubstantiated Trump dossier . We of course received a number of emails on the topic and this office has been looking into it . Here ’s one common reader complaint . The public editor ’s take : It sounds as if you came upon a rare link here to the BuzzFeed article . I ’m told that Times staffers were given clear instructions not to link to it but it appears one article briefly did so . Given how much of a point The Times made about the dossier being unsubstantiated it would have been having it both ways to refuse to publish the documents but then link to BuzzFeed . Another reader pointed out that while The Times emphasized that the claims in the dossier were unsubstantiated it did not go to such lengths in covering Hillary Clinton ’s scandals during the presidential election . This week Trump also decided to give his Jared Kushner a place in his government as a senior White House adviser . The Times covered the decision thoroughly giving readers a better view into the man ’s background . But some readers took issue with his religion being noted often
" After 100 years of selling cookies the Girl Scouts have come up with two new flavors . It may seem odd that it took a century when the inspiration was right under their noses : s’mores . The Girl Scouts first published a recipe for the quintessential campfire snack in 1927 . The two newcomers share the same name Girl Scout S’mores but play separate variations on the theme of chocolate marshmallow and graham cracker . In a bit of hairsplitting worthy of a merit badge for marketing one is billed as “ crispy ” and the other as “ crunchy . ” The crispy cookie is a thick slab of graham cracker coated with a fine layer of sweet white frosting and a much thicker one of chocolate produced by ABC Bakers of Richmond Va . The crunchy cookie is a graham sandwich filled with a layer of chocolate and another of marshmallowlike icing produced by Little Brownie Bakers of Louisville Ky . Why two versions ? The Girl Scouts need two manufacturers to meet the demand for two million boxes of cookies a year presented with the idea for S’mores each bakery took its own approach . As connoisseurs know there are regional variations in the popular Thin Mint cookies and strong similarities between Samoas and Caramel deLites . Neither of the S’mores has been seared over embers under the stars as prescribed in that 1927 recipe for “ Some More . ” But early taste tests online and among The New York Times ’s Food staff showed a slight preference for the sandwich cookie for its balanced sweetness and tender fudgelike center . Girl Scout cookie season typically opens in January and ends in April

Message me here til I can get it fixed . ” Friends replied with advice ( “ Put it in rice ” ) or with offers to lend her a phone . This week the police in Orlando where the McShanes lived revealed that the author of some of those messages was not Ms. McShane who was 30 but her husband . Mr. McShane posted the Facebook message about her phone so that others would not become alarmed because she “ was not returning their phone calls or text messages ” the police said . Officers were called to the house on Jan. 10 by a relative of the couple who had been concerned about them
" HAMBURG — Of course there was Beethoven . After all what better way to conclude the opening concert of the Elbphilharmonie concert hall here than with the jubilant “ Ode to Joy ” ? It ’s a choral classic but Wednesday ’s scintillating concert starring the NDR Symphony Orchestra now renamed the NDR Elbphilharmonie Orchestra opened with the slender pliable tone of a single oboe — the instrument to which other players tune in halls around the world . To inaugurate this dazzling hall nestled inside an $ 800 million glass structure set atop an old brick warehouse overlooking the port here the conductor Thomas Hengelbrock assembled a program . Taking as its motto a line from Wagner ’s “ Parsifal ” — “ Here time becomes space ” — the concert linked fragile chamber performances and flashy orchestral tours de force spanning 400 years of music history into a riveting narrative . Its proud protagonist : the hall itself . Depending on where you sat in the tiered auditorium you had to crane your neck to see where the first sounds were coming from when the oboist Kalev Kuljus standing on a high balcony intoned the first rhapsodic phrases of Britten ’s “ Pan ” from “ Six Metamorphoses After Ovid . ” His penetrating and clear tone helped to concentrate your ear on the sonic roller coaster that followed beginning with the metallic aureole of Dutilleux ’s “ Mystère de l’instant . ” From there early and recent music alternated fluidly with individual performers placed high in the farthest rows . The countertenor Philippe Jaroussky elegantly accompanied by the harpist Margret Köll sang music written by Emilio de ’ Cavalieri and Antonio Archilei for a 1589 Florentine court wedding his zesty voice effortlessly carrying across the auditorium . The dark growling rumbles of Bernd Alois Zimmermann ’s “ Photoptosis
" The Schomburg Center for Research in Black Culture in New York City Chicano Park in San Diego a Native American burial ground in Kansas and the site of the 1970 shootings at Kent State University are among 24 newly designated National Historic Landmarks . The list of new landmarks announced on Wednesday comes as the National Park Service the division of the Department of the Interior that administers the landmarks program has finished celebrating its 100th anniversary . It reflects an effort to tell what a news release called “ a more inclusive and diverse story of America ’s history . ” “ These 24 new designations depict different threads of the American story that have been told through activism architecture music and religious observance ” Sally Jewell the secretary of the Interior said in a statement . “ Their designation ensures that future generations have the ability to learn from the past . ” The sites which join a list of more than 2500 existing national historic landmarks may reflect America ’s past but they also might be read as carrying some pointed political lessons for the future . They include the homes of the slain civil rights leader Medgar Evers the lawyer and women ’s rights activist Pauli Murray and the Tejano statesman José Antonio Navarro who is cited for “ his commitments to both American ideals and to the rights of Texan ” in the period before and after Texas became part of the United States . The Navarro home is just one of several new landmarks relating to the history of activism including Chicano Park in San Diego site of some ultimately successful 1970 community protests . Other citations speak to the sometimes deadly legacies of government action . The citation for Wyandotte National Burying Ground in Kansas City Kan . describes it as “ tangible evidence of the consequences of federal American Indian removal policy to a tribal population and its identity . ” The citation for the Kent State site where the Ohio National Guard shot and killed four students and wounded nine other people during a protest against the Vietnam War
" When Wells Fargo announced its quarterly earnings Friday morning it was clear that many of its customers were not exactly pleased . In recent months the number of new consumer checking accounts had fallen sharply which is no surprise for a bank that paid a hefty fine in September for opening accounts of all sorts without customers ’ permission . Just for good measure it ’s trying to force customers who want to sue to take their disputes to mandatory arbitration . And in its earnings announcement the company said that measurements of “ loyalty ” were going to take awhile longer to recover . To many consumers Wells Fargo deserves a kind of death penalty : In the same way one might never buy a car again from the cheaters at Volkswagen it makes little sense to do business with Wells Fargo either . But an equally good reason to steer clear might be this : Its products and services are mostly middling . The bank rarely is a leader on pricing or rewards . It specializes in ubiquity with storefronts in all 50 states and it hopes that we ’ll be too lazy to find better deals elsewhere . The bank claims to be serious about pivoting now ( despite having only shuffled the deck chairs in its executive roster ousting its C. E. O. and elevating his top deputy ) . So if it wants to stand for something in the minds of consumers other than shoving unwanted products down people ’s throats it might try new approaches — like generosity clarity integrity and good citizenship — on for size instead . Let ’s take some of those things and the bank ’s “ ” offerings in order : GENEROSITY Consider Wells Fargo ’s basic savings account offerings . Or don ’t lest you be insulted by the interest rates . How does 0 . 01 percent sound to you ? But if you have more than $ 100 000 that you need to keep safe for a while the bank will increase that amount tenfold to a whopping 0 . 1 percent ! Is there something about being a large financial institution that makes offering a competitive interest rate impossible ? Not at all . Household names like Barclays Discover and Goldman Sachs are happy to give you at least nine times what Wells Fargo does . The news isn ’t much better for credit cards . While American Express
" “ Homeland ” a series always conscious of current events tries for some enforced topicality in its sixth season which begins on Sunday on Showtime . Moving out of the fall for the first time the show has a story line pegged to its new winter slot and to the recent election : The season is set during a presidential transition with a whose relationship to intelligence agencies is dicey . Not even the most prescient of shows can see the future perfectly though . The fictional incipient president is a woman ( played by Elizabeth Marvel ) and her politics appear to be dovish : She floats the idea of the United States ’ pulling all its troops out of the Middle East . Those details put quite a distance between “ Homeland ” and the reality of the real Donald J. Trump . But it ’s not gender or views that make the show feel out of tune with the times . It ’s the courtesy the characters exhibit as they argue and negotiate their automatic respect for the traditional processes of government . Life at the moment is scarier than fiction and compared with the wholesale disintegration of civility taking place in Washington “ Homeland ” looks quaint . It ’s as if it were happening in another century . And that ’s not a bad thing . There ’s something comforting about the normalcy of plot and counterplot action and intrigue . Those have always been the series ’s strong points not ideas and it may be easier to focus on them without worrying about how closely the story is mimicking events . This peripatetic show is set for the first time in New York where the former C. I. A. officer Carrie Mathison ( Claire Danes ) is working for an outpost of the German foundation that employed her in Season 5. Otto Düring ( Sebastian Koch ) her boss and ( as far as we know ) unrequited admirer asks why she ’s wasting her time doing work helping Muslim Americans negotiate the legal system . The answer is that it ’s where she can keep an eye on her soul mate Quinn ( Rupert Friend ) who ’s living in a veterans ’ hospital after being last season . The show ’s usual roles have been reversed : Quinn is a mess and Carrie
" “ The best people . ” This refrain rang throughout Donald Trump ’s presidential campaign at times it seemed to be his justification for being in the race at all . He wasn ’t a politician — he was a businessman . He had never run a government but he ran a company and running a company is at bottom easy : You get the best people . The pitch worked and Trump will be sworn in as the 45th president of the United States of America . In the meantime he has been stocking his cabinet with what he promises are the best people . Even without thinking too hard about what “ best ” means — best for whom ? to do what ? — it ’s still instructive to see who made the cut . The two people who will be perched on Trump ’s shoulders his chief of staff Reince Priebus and his chief strategist Steve Bannon are white men . The top layer of his cabinet — the attorney general as well as the secretaries of state Treasury and defense — is made up of white men . In fact if you print out a chart with the faces of Trump ’s picks on it the first thing you ’re likely to notice about it is that his cabinet consists almost entirely of white men . And the second thing you ’re likely to notice is Dr. Ben Carson . His is a conspicuous face . It ’s black for one which makes it in this cabinet unique . It ’s also famous : Carson is one of the medical doctors of our time and mounted a presidential run of his own . But Carson ’s face seems to be in the wrong place . The retired neurosurgeon won ’t be running say Health and Human Services he ’ll manage the Department of Housing and Urban Development . His inclusion is conspicuous for another reason too : Shortly after the election
" At a sleepy show last month in the grim basement of the Broadway Comedy Club a Midtown spot that feels frozen in time from the 1980 s comedy boom Julio Torres looked at his feet speaking to a small crowd in a near monotone . “ The hardest part about being vegan is the apologies ” he said to silence . “ People ask if I miss meat or dairy . I miss being liked . ” Mr. Torres a millennial comic with a slight build shy persona and a hint of an accent ( he emigrated from El Salvador ) is better known in alternative spaces than in clubs but this line got a big laugh . He raised his blond head and made eye contact before going for the kill : “ I don ’t miss cheese . I miss being asked to do things . I miss my friends and family . ” Judging by the surroundings you would never know that Mr. Torres is the newest star of “ Saturday Night Live . ” He has never appeared on the show but if you ’ve been surprised by incongruously dreamy comedy this season chances are he had something to do with it . Mr. Torres who has the same delightfully alien sensibility as his sometimes nickname Space Prince joined the writing staff in the fall and has already introduced a new style to the show which returns on Saturday after a holiday break . Early in his tenure he wrote a distinctively moody digital short half in Spanish starring Miranda as a sensitive boy named Diego calling his mother in Mexico from a telephone booth in a North Dakota cornfield describing America with wonder and romance . ( He explains a marshmallow salad with the baffled awe of someone seeing a U. F. O. ) This monologue played as flashbacks of signs and football players took nostalgic tropes of Americana and repurposed them into an immigrant ’s love letter . There were slight homoerotic overtones but not a note of gay panic . Mr. Torres
" On Jan. 21 the day after the inauguration women from all over the country will be rolling into Washington for what promises to be an enormous protest against Donald J. Trump . But millions of women went to the polls for Mr. Trump on Election Day including according to surveys 53 percent of white women . Why did they ? Conventional wisdom that his behavior and remarks would disqualify him in the eyes of many women proved wrong . Interviews with more than a dozen women around the country showed a range of reasons for their support : worries about the economy anger about the Affordable Care Act and the price of health care protection of Second Amendment rights fears about immigration and terrorism and opposition to abortion . But many women also voted against Hillary Clinton voicing deep suspicions about the American deaths in Benghazi Libya her use of a private email server and the hacked emails of the Democratic National Committee as proof that she said one thing in public and another in private . Here are excerpts condensed and edited from their thoughts . Voter : Rebecca Gregory 46 . Nurse . Home : Roseville Mich . In 2008 and 2012 I voted for Obama I was marriage Planned Parenthood was very important to me . But after eight years I saw there was much more racial divide than there had ever been
1.0"WASHINGTON — On Friday Representative John Lewis Democrat of Georgia declared that he did not view Donald J. Trump as a “ legitimate president . ” Mr. Lewis an icon of the civil rights movement said he planned to boycott the inauguration the first he will skip in three decades . On Saturday Mr. Trump hit back . “ Congressman John Lewis should spend more time on fixing and helping his district which is in horrible shape and falling apart ( not to mention crime infested ) rather than falsely complaining about the election results ” Mr. Trump said in a pair of early morning Twitter posts . “ All talk talk talk — no action or results ” he added . “ Sad ! ” While some questioned Mr. Lewis ’s assertion many others expressed indignation about Mr. Trump ’s outburst pointing out the unseemliness of attacking a civil rights leader on the eve of Martin Luther King Jr . Day . Mr. Lewis was one of the original Freedom Riders beaten by police officers while marching from Selma to Montgomery in Alabama . Others ridiculed Mr. Trump ’s characterization of Mr. Lewis ’s district which is majority and encompasses of Atlanta as “ horrible ” “ falling apart ” and “ crime infested . ” In fact
" WASHINGTON — America ’s intelligence chiefs sat down with members of Congress behind closed doors on Friday for what they thought would be a straightforward briefing on Russian cyberattacks . What ensued instead was a confrontation Democrats have long sought with James B. Comey the director of the Federal Bureau of Investigation . Why the House Democrats demanded to know did Mr. Comey believe it was O. K. to make repeated disclosures during the campaign about the investigation into Hillary Clinton ’s emails but to this day refuse to say if the F. B. I. is investigating links between the Trump campaign and Russia ? His answers did not prove very satisfying . Representative Nancy Pelosi of California the minority leader grew so frustrated that at one point she chastised Mr. Comey for being “ condescending to members . ” Representative Debbie Wasserman Schultz of Florida who was chairwoman of the Democratic National Committee when it was hacked asked why Mr. Comey had never called her about the intrusions which began in August 2015 and continued over the course of many months . The F. B. I. notified the committee of the original hacking but reached a tech support contractor and went back and forth with him for months before the leadership of the organization was informed and took steps to halt the intrusion . The committee and the bureau have blamed each other for the delay and the pattern continued on Friday according to multiple Democrats in the meeting . Afterward Representative Adam B. Schiff Democrat of California called the tenor of the exchanges “ contentious at times . ” “ I don ’t want to go into the contents of what were discussed ” Mr. Schiff said . But “ a great many members are concerned with whether the director has employed a double standard . ” The hearing took place a day after the Justice Department ’s inspector general said it was investigating Mr. Comey ’s decision during the campaign to hold a news conference announcing the end of the case — and then just before the election inform Congress there was possible new evidence only to say days later that it did not amount to anything . Mr. Comey “ didn ’t really answer ” said Representative Jerrold Nadler of New York . He dismissively referred to Mr. Comey as “ a policeman ” and added “ I don ’t remember anything substantive he said . ” The reaction to the assessment by intelligence agencies that Russia sought to promote the candidacy of Donald J. Trump has been mixed . Mr. Trump has seen it as undermining his electoral victory and ridiculed the agencies
" Jennifer Holliday the winning singer who on Friday said she planned to sing at an welcome concert next week on Saturday changed her mind citing opposition to her appearance from the gay and lesbian community . Ms. Holliday in a letter she provided to The Wrap an entertainment news website said she would no longer take part in any events affiliated with the inauguration of Donald J. Trump as president . Her decision to withdraw she said was influenced by an article in The Daily Beast about how her planned appearance was heartbreaking to her gay fans . She also retweeted an piece in the Boston Globe describing Mr. Trump ’s cabinet nominees as “ a who ’s who of homophobia . ” “ I sincerely apologize for my lapse of judgment for being uneducated on the issues that affect every American at this crucial time in history and for causing such dismay and heartbreak to my fans ” she wrote . “ Please know that I HEAR YOU and I feel your pain ” she added . “ The LGBT Community was mostly responsible for birthing my career and I am deeply indebted to you . … You have loved me faithfully and unconditionally and for so many years you provided me with work even though my star had long since faded . ” Her spokesman William Carpenter confirmed the withdrawal . “ After she saw how hurt so many people were at the idea of her performing she decided to pull out and not cause any extra anger or hurt ” he said in an email . Ms. Holliday won a Tony Award in 1982 for her performance as Effie White in the original production of “ Dreamgirls ” and she returned to Broadway this season as a replacement Shug Avery in a revival of “ The Color Purple . ” In an interview on Friday she said that although she had voted for Hillary Clinton for president she agreed to sing at a welcome concert on the National Mall the day before Mr. Trump ’s inauguration because she viewed it as a performance for the people not the politician . She noted that she had performed at the invitation of Presidents Ronald Reagan George H. W. Bush
" Looking to the federal government to rein in police excesses can be an exercise in managed expectations . On Friday Chicago agreed to revamp its police department after the Justice Department found routine use of excessive force and the mayor said he would negotiate a settlement known as a consent decree . But that is no guarantee of results — and not just because the man most likely to be the next attorney general has said he is skeptical of such endeavors . Attempts to force change in police departments have met with mixed success even under the Obama administration which made police reform a signature issue . It has opened 25 investigations into law enforcement agencies over issues like excessive force racial bias and poor supervision issuing reports choking with outrage . Los Angeles which was under a consent decree for 11 years is regarded as one of the great success stories . “ Los Angeles is a different place today because of the consent decree and the leadership of the department ” said Chuck Wexler the executive director of the Police Executive Research Forum a Washington think tank . In Detroit which emerged from a consent decree last year officer shootings and warrantless arrests have declined significantly . But Pittsburgh the target of the first consent decree based on a Justice Department finding of a “ pattern and practice ” of misconduct later backslid after changes in leadership said Samuel Walker a criminal justice professor at the University of Nebraska at Omaha . And while Miami reduced police shootings to zero for 20 months after a federal investigation in 2002 that was later closed with no settlement the Justice Department in 2013 reinvestigated and found a pattern of excessive force with firearms underscoring some experts ’ view that consent decrees or other settlements are needed for enduring improvements . Last year
" WASHINGTON — Only weeks after 70 million Americans chose a black man for president shattering a racial barrier that had stood for the entirety of the nation ’s history no one in the White House especially the man in the Oval Office wanted to talk about race . President Obama had made a pragmatic calculation in January 2009 as the financial crisis drove communities across the United States toward economic collapse . Whatever he did for whose neighborhoods were suffering more than others he would not describe as efforts to specifically help Black America . Mr. Obama made the decision knowing how powerfully his election had raised the hopes of — and knowing that no matter what he did it would not be seen as enough . “ I remember thinking ‘ They are going to hate us one day ’ ” said Melody Barnes who is black and served as Mr. Obama ’s first domestic policy adviser recalling her sadness when she stood in an auditorium in those early months as a crowd cheered for the success of the new president . “ I knew that we couldn ’t do everything that people wanted to meet those expectations . ” The fear inside the West Wing was that promoting a “ black agenda ” and aiming programs directly at at a time of widespread economic anxiety would provoke a white backlash — the kind that years later White House officials would view as helping to elect Donald J. Trump . “ At a minimum that would have been tone deaf ” said Eric H. Holder Jr . who served as the nation ’s first attorney general during much of Mr. Obama ’s presidency “ and at worst would have created a reaction in the larger community that would have prevented the things you wanted to do . ” Mr. Obama who had grown up straddling two worlds as the son of a black man from Kenya and a white woman from Kansas wanted to be the president of all America . Framing his efforts in racial terms could exacerbate something that was already simmering
" Every Friday we ’ll offer a Trilobite talking point to help you bring a bit more science to your weekend conversations . Earth is old . The sun is old . But do you know what may be even older than both ? Water . It ’s a mystery how the world became awash in it . But one prevailing theory says that water originated on our planet from ice specks floating in a cosmic cloud before our sun was set ablaze more than 4. 6 billion years ago . As much as half of all the water on Earth may have come from that interstellar gas according to astrophysicists ’ calculations . That means the same liquid we drink and that fills the oceans may be millions of years older than the solar system itself . The thinking goes that some of the ancient ice survived the solar system ’s chaotic creation and came to Earth . To demonstrate that researchers analyzed water molecules in oceans for indicators of their ancient past . The clue comes in the form of something known as “ heavy water . ” Water as you know is made up of two hydrogen atoms and one oxygen atom . But some water molecules contain hydrogen ’s chunky twin deuterium . ( It contains a neutron in its nucleus whereas regular hydrogen does not . ) water is found on other planets and moons even here on Earth but researchers are not sure where it came from . One idea is that much of the heavy water formed in the interstellar cloud and then traveled across the solar system . Using a computer model the scientists showed in a 2014 paper that the ice molecules could have survived the sun ’s violent radiation blasts and gone on to bathe a forming Earth and its cousins . They concluded that remnants of that ancient ice remain scattered across the solar system : on the moon in comets at Mercury ’s poles in the remains of Mars ’ melts on Jupiter ’s moon Europa — and even in your water bottle . Now that ’s something to raise your glass to . Previous Trilobite talking points : Plants will remember if you mess with them enough and yes you are at the center of the universe . "
1.0"CHENGDU China — Mao once said that a revolution was not a dinner party . But with the communist revolution turning into opulent capitalism China ’s rich are now making sure the dinner party settings are immaculate and the wine is poured just right . Inspired in part by the “ Downton Abbey ” television drama the country ’s once raw and raucous tycoons are aspiring to decorum fueling demand for the services of homegrown butlers trained in the ways of a British manor . “ What they would like to say to their friends is ‘ Look I have a butler an butler in my home ’ to show how wealthy they are ” said Neal Yeh a Briton living in Beijing who for over a decade has helped train and find jobs for butlers . “ The country now with the biggest trend in butlers is China ” said Mr. Yeh whose English accent would be at home on “ Downton Abbey ” the television series about a blue blood family in England which was avidly watched in China . “ I dare say I have played a part in starting this trend . ” Butler training schools and agencies have been doing business in China for more than a decade but the number of recruits has grown sharply in recent years according to those in the business . Most are Chinese and many are women . The International Butler Academy China opened in 2014 here in Chengdu a city in southwest China
" VANDENBERG AIR FORCE BASE Calif. — A Falcon 9 rocket roared into the sky on Saturday carrying 10 communications satellites — a return by SpaceX and its billionaire leader Elon Musk to the business of launching satellites to orbit . But financial details disclosed this past week about the company overshadowed the successful liftoff raising questions about the viability of Mr. Musk ’s plans for SpaceX and his vision of sending people to Mars . SpaceX based in Hawthorne Calif. has been set back since September when a different Falcon 9 caught fire and exploded on a launchpad in Florida destroying the rocket and its payload a $ 200 million Israeli satellite that Facebook had planned to lease to expand global internet services . The company ’s rockets had been grounded since then . An internal investigation concluded that a failure of a helium vessel in the second stage liquid oxygen tank had led to the conflagration . The Federal Aviation Administration which regulates commercial space launches accepted SpaceX ’s report on the explosion ’s causes on Jan. 6 and issued a launch license clearing the way for Saturday ’s liftoff here on the other side of the country . To prevent a recurrence SpaceX adjusted its fueling procedures to avoid overcooling of the helium . Saturday ’s countdown proceeded smoothly with the liftoff occurring within a window that would send the rocket on a trajectory to line up with the orbit of a group of current Iridium Communications satellites . The new satellites are more powerful than the original ones which have been in orbit nearly two decades and have outlived their designed lifetimes . SpaceX also repeated its feat of recovering the first stage of the Falcon 9 rocket landing it on a floating platform named “ Just Read the Instructions ” in the Pacific . Less than 90 minutes later mission control received confirmation that all 10 satellites had been successfully deployed . Over the next 14 months the company plans six additional Falcon 9 launches to deploy 60 more Iridium satellites that will completely replace the constellation . In the the successful launch helps put SpaceX back on track . The explosion and subsequent grounding created a backlog of launches
" What do households on food stamps buy at the grocery store ? The answer was largely a mystery until now . The United States Department of Agriculture which oversees the $ 74 billion food stamp program called SNAP has published a detailed report that provides a glimpse into the shopping cart of the typical household that receives food stamps . The findings show that the No. 1 purchases by SNAP households are soft drinks which accounted for 5 percent of the dollars they spent on food . The category of ‘ sweetened beverages ’ which includes soft drinks fruit juices energy drinks and sweetened teas accounted for almost 10 percent of the dollars they spent on food . “ In this sense SNAP is a taxpayer subsidy of the soda industry ” said Marion Nestle a professor of nutrition food studies and public health at New York University . “ It ’s pretty shocking . ” For years dozens of cities states and medical groups have urged changes to SNAP or the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program to help improve nutrition among the 43 million poorest Americans who receive food stamps . Specifically they have called for restrictions so that food stamps cannot be used to buy junk food or sugary soft drinks . But the food and beverage industries have spent millions opposing such measures and the U. S. D. A. has denied every request saying that selectively banning certain foods would be unfair to food stamp users and create too much red tape . While the report published recently suggests that a disproportionate amount of food stamp money is going toward unhealthful foods
2.0"William Peter Blatty the author whose book “ The Exorcist ” was both a milestone in horror fiction and a turning point in his own career died on Thursday in Bethesda Md . He was 89 . The cause was multiple myeloma his wife Julie Blatty said . “ The Exorcist ” the story of a girl possessed by a demon was published in 1971 and sold more than 13 million copies . The 1973 movie version starring Linda Blair and directed by William Friedkin was a runaway hit breaking records at many theaters and becoming the film to date for Warner Bros. studios . It earned Mr. Blatty who wrote the screenplay an Academy Award . ( It was also the first horror movie nominated for the Oscar . ) “ The Exorcist ” marked a radical shift in Mr. Blatty ’s career which was already well established in another genre : He was one of Hollywood ’s leading comedy writers . Mr. Blatty collaborated with the director Blake Edwards on the screenplays for four films beginning in 1964 with “ A Shot in the Dark ” the second movie ( after “ The Pink Panther ” ) starring Peter Sellers as the bumbling Inspector Clouseau and in some critics ’ view the best . His other Edwards films were the comedy “ What Did You Do in the War
" ATLANTA — In the playoffs when the best teams meet games are often decided by a mistake here or there or a penalty called or not called . Under Coach Pete Carroll the Seattle Seahawks have built a reputation of minimizing those mistakes and forcing their opponents to make them instead . But on Saturday it was the Seahawks who came up short in a playoff game against the Atlanta Falcons and their potent offense . The Falcons advanced to the N. F. C. championship game next Sunday when they will face the winner of this Sunday ’s game between the Dallas Cowboys and the Green Bay Packers . The Seahawks were leading when they forced the Falcons to punt early in the second quarter . Seattle ’s Devin Hester who has returned 19 kickoffs and punts for touchdowns during his career caught the kick spun away from a defender then sprinted down the sideline before being knocked out of bounds deep in Falcons territory . The Seahawks appeared poised to build a lead . But a holding call on Seattle linebacker Kevin negated the runback and reversed Seattle ’s field position — from the Atlanta line to its own line — and two plays later quarterback Russell Wilson fell backward into the end zone for a safety . After the ensuing kickoff Falcons quarterback Matt Ryan quickly hit receiver Taylor Gabriel for 37 yards . Four plays later the Falcons kicked a field goal to go ahead . The quick turnaround unhinged the Seahawks while the Falcons sprinted ahead and captured their first playoff victory in four years . After taking the lead in the second quarter Atlanta ’s potent offense had its way with Seattle ’s defense — one of the stingiest in the N. F. L. despite missing the star free safety Earl Thomas who broke his leg in Week 13 . Just before halftime Ryan led a march that ended with a touchdown pass to Tevin Coleman to put the Falcons up . “ You knew it was going to be a fight in terms of their defense against our offense
" ESCONDIDO Calif. — In Southern California in the fall of 2015 a giant natural gas leak not only caused one of the worst environmental disasters in the nation ’s history it also knocked out a critical fuel source for regional power plants . Energy regulators needed a quick fix . But rather than sticking with gas they turned to a technology more closely associated with flashlights : batteries . They freed up the utilities to start installing batteries — and lots of them . It is a solution that ’s audacious and risky . The idea is that the batteries can store electricity during daylight hours ( when the state ’s many solar panels are flooding the grid with power ) then release it as demand peaks ( early evening when people get home ) . In effect the rechargeable batteries are like an power plant and in theory able to replace an actual plant . Utilities have been studying batteries nationwide . But none have moved ahead with the gusto of those in Southern California . This idea has potential . But the challenge of storing electricity has vexed engineers researchers policy makers and entrepreneurs for centuries . Even as countless technologies have raced ahead batteries haven ’t yet fulfilled their promise . And the most powerful new designs come with their own risks such as fire or explosion if poorly made or maintained . It ’s the same problem that forced Samsung to recall 2. 5 million Galaxy Note 7 smartphones in September because of fire risk . After racing for months engineers here in California have brought three sites close to completion to begin serving the Southern California electric grid within the next month . They are made up of thousands of oversize versions of the batteries now widely used in smartphones laptop computers and other digital devices . One of the installations at a San Diego Gas Electric operations center surrounded by industrial parks in Escondido Calif. 30 miles north of San Diego will be the largest of its kind in the world developers say . It represents the most crucial test yet of an technology that many experts see as fundamental to a future . Here about 130 miles southeast of Aliso Canyon
" All that was missing from the Connecticut women ’s basketball team ’s shattering of its own N. C. A. A. winning streak on Saturday was a sense of drama and amazement . victories in a row with no end to the winning in sight ? “ Honestly I don ’t sit here and figure out how many games we ’re going to win in a row ” Coach Geno Auriemma said before the Huskies broke out to a lead and obliterated Southern Methodist in Dallas to write the latest chapter in the program ’s illustrious history . “ We ’ve done it before . ” From 2008 to 2010 his team powered by Maya Moore chased and overtook the streak set by the U. C. L. A. men ’s team in 1974 peaking at 90 straight before losing to Stanford . Given Connecticut ’s dominance of the college women ’s game — the Huskies have won the last four national titles and a record 11 in all under Auriemma — the notion of another lengthy streak was never a question . But when Connecticut finished an unbeaten season last April by routing Syracuse in the national title game for its 75th straight victory the widespread belief in women ’s basketball circles was that the latest streak would quickly end and that the next edition of the team could lose multiple games . In the 2016 W. N. B. A. draft the graduating portion of the UConn roster provided the top three picks including Breanna Stewart who was named the most outstanding player all four years she played in the Final Four . Going into this season the Huskies for once lacked a preseason and they had an undersized front line a shallow bench and uncertainty at the point guard position . But they did begin with a belief in the system generated by so much success and by Auriemma who seldom lacks in . “ Everybody in the whole country has talked about what we ’ve lost ” said Kia Nurse a junior and national champion . “ I personally like playing with a chip on our shoulder . ” That chip has turned into a steamrollering boulder . The streak nearly ended on opening night at Florida State when the Seminoles had a shot in the air for the win . The shot fell short and nobody has pushed the Huskies that hard since . It wasn ’t as if they took the path of least resistance to victory No. 91 . Auriemma had joked that everyone was eager to schedule Connecticut this season
" United States prosecutors said on Friday that they had charged three executives at Takata the Japanese auto parts maker with fabricating test data to mask a fatal airbag defect a striking turn in a case that set off the largest automotive recall in United States history . Prosecutors also announced that Takata had agreed to plead guilty to charges of wire fraud for providing the false data a rare outcome for businesses accused of wrongdoing . The company based in Tokyo was also fined $ 1 billion . The guilty plea and fine had been widely expected but the charges against the executives intensified a scandal that has roiled regulators led to congressional hearings and brought the Japanese manufacturer to the brink of bankruptcy . The airbags which can rupture violently when they deploy have been linked to at least 11 deaths and more than 180 injuries in the United States . “ They falsified and manipulated data because they wanted to make profits on their airbags knowing they were creating risk for the who are soccer moms like me ” Barbara L. McQuade a United States attorney for the Eastern District of Michigan said at a news conference in Detroit . “ The risk they allowed is really reprehensible ” she said . “ We want auto suppliers to know they have to put safety ahead of profits . Cheaters will not be allowed to gain a competitive advantage . ” The indictments are the latest moves by the outgoing Obama administration to come down harder on crime including guilty pleas from companies and charges against individual managers and executives . Federal prosecutors this week also charged six Volkswagen executives for their roles in an scandal and the automaker pleaded guilty to charges of conspiracy and other crimes . The efforts are seen as a departure from the years following the 2008 financial crisis when not a single top bank executive went to prison fueling a public outcry over the perception that Wall Street giants were “ too big to jail . ” Takata ’s executives are accused of especially egregious conduct . According to the indictment the executives were at the center of efforts to manipulate airbag safety data that continued for as long as 15 years . They knew as early as 2000 that the airbags ’ metal inflaters could explode
" MEXICO CITY — It might have been any other day in El Salvador but as the hours ticked into evening it became notable not for what happened but for what didn’t . An entire day had passed without a single murder in one of the world ’s most violent places . There was no particular reason the count was zero on Wednesday Howard Cotto the director of the National Civil Police told local reporters the next day . Indeed the police had registered 99 murders in the first 10 days of 2017 — an average of almost 10 a day . Gang violence in El Salvador an impoverished Central American country of 6. 5 million has given it one of the highest murder rates of any nation that is not at war . Youth gangs battle one another over extortion rackets that extend to the smallest of businesses and no one seems to be immune from the bloodshed which is also exacting a toll on the police . Mr. Cotto noted that violence began to decline last year which ended with 5278 murders . Although the average was more than 14 a day it was still 20 percent fewer than in 2015 . Yet even with the decline the murder rate was more than 80 homicides per 100000 residents last year compared with five per 100000 in the United States in 2015 according to the most recent F. B. I. figures . Two years ago the government of President Salvador Sánchez Cerén threw out a fraying truce that the previous government had worked out with the gangs . A crackdown sent heavily armed security forces into the streets . Police commanders gave their officers virtually free rein to shoot “ if they must ” in encounters with criminals and promised legal support in cases filed against them . The most powerful gangs Mara Salvatrucha and two rival factions of Barrio 18
" HAVANA — Andrés Iván and his girlfriend grew up in Cuba but had long planned their future in the United States . She left four months ago to find work and made it to Miami where she was legally welcomed . He stayed in Havana knowing the United States ’ special treatment of Cubans gave him the freedom to rejoin her and marry when the moment was right . Those dreams were dashed on Thursday when President Obama announced the immediate end of the longstanding policy under which any Cuban who made it to American soil was admitted and placed on a glide path to citizenship . “ Our relationship has been built on two things : love and the idea that we will create a life together in the U. S. — whether that ’s in one year or five ” Mr. Iván said here on Friday . “ Now I have to realign my entire life plan . ” He is among an untold numbers of Cubans doing so including what could be thousands stranded midjourney whether by boat or by land often through Mexico . Those who arrived at border stations in Arizona California and Texas on Thursday were let in . Those still on the Mexican side were left to consider whether to try to sneak across or hire smugglers to take them into a country that as of Friday would treat them as illegal entrants just like those from other countries . Alexander Iglesias Rodríguez 41 a veterinarian who reared cows in Cienfuegos on Cuba ’s southern coast left the country on Wednesday six weeks after his wife and his son Gabriel 16 . They flew to Mexico and then crossed the border in Matamoros . He delayed his departure so as not to draw attention from immigration authorities in Cuba and Mexico . He sold his 1956 Pontiac his head of cattle and his house pulling together about $ 12 000 . He was in Mexico about to cross into the United States when the order came down . “ So many years dreaming about this
" We ’re fresh over the Canadian border in a supermarket on Vancouver Island gathering supplies for our first night on the road . There are three of us and as we come together at checkout and pile our dinner ingredients onto the conveyor belt the woman at the register doesn ’t seem to know what to make of us . She watches our selections roll toward her : a rotisserie chicken instant mashed potatoes spinach marshmallows bottled water . We are three young women wearing motorcycle jackets and heavy boots bandannas knotted around our necks . Lindsay asks her to add a bundle of firewood to the tally and suddenly our presence here just down the road from the Bamberton campground clicks into place for her . “ Did you leave your men at the campsite ? ” she asks . We laugh not meaning to be rude but the question strikes us as absurd . “ Nope ” Lindsay tells her . “ We left the men at home . ” She is confused and intrigued . Another woman comes to bag our purchases and we chat with them both for a moment about the campground up the road about our journey and about the fact that our men were not invited . The assumption that there are men waiting for us anywhere at all is a tangle for another day . They are excited for us are thrilled to learn about our motorcycle adventure — from Seattle to Banff then back across through Montana Idaho and Washington . “ Have the best time ” they say . We thank them
" George Motz a burly Brooklynite fashions himself as America ’s hamburger expert . An enthusiastic carnivore who has chronicled his love affair with ground beef through books and films Mr. Motz estimates he has eaten more than 14000 hamburgers over the last 20 years . But on a frigid Monday in December Mr. Motz sat down for a burger that promised to be unlike any he had eaten before . He was at Momofuku Nishi a new restaurant from the celebrity chef David Chang and he had come to eat the Impossible Burger . The Impossible Burger wants to be the tech industry ’s answer to the Big Mac . Concocted by a team of food scientists in Silicon Valley it is made from wheat coconut oil and potatoes yet it aims to be more than just another veggie patty . Thanks to the addition of heme an molecule contained in blood ( which the company produces in bulk using fermented yeast ) it is designed to look smell sizzle and taste like a beef burger . Patrick Brown the founder and chief executive of Impossible Foods said the goal was to disrupt the market for ground beef without killing cows . “ You can have uncompromisingly delicious meat without using animals ” Mr. Brown said in an interview . Mr. Brown a former biochemist at Stanford who founded Impossible Foods about six years ago said that in blind taste tests some people could not distinguish between the Impossible Burger and a beef patty . And in an informal tasting organized by The New York Times
1.0"WASHINGTON — A legal fight to clean up tons of chicken manure fouling the waters of Oklahoma ’s bucolic northeastern corner — much of it from neighboring Arkansas — was in full swing six years ago when the conservative lawyer Scott Pruitt took office as Oklahoma ’s attorney general . His response : Put on the brakes . Rather than push for a federal judge to punish the companies by extracting perhaps tens of millions of dollars in damages Oklahoma ’s new chief law enforcement officer quietly negotiated a deal to simply study the problem further . The move came after he had taken tens of thousands of dollars in campaign contributions from executives and lawyers for the poultry industry . It was one of a series of instances in which Mr. Pruitt put cooperation with industry before confrontation as he sought to blunt the impact of federal environmental policies in his state — against oil gas agriculture and other interests . His antipathy to federal regulation — he sued the Environmental Protection Agency 14 times — in many ways defined his tenure as Oklahoma ’s attorney general . Now Mr. Pruitt tapped to head Donald J. Trump ’s Environmental Protection Agency will have the opportunity to engineer a radical shift in Washington . If confirmed by the Senate he is expected to shelve the Obama administration ’s aggressive environmental enforcement and embrace a more collaborative approach with the industries that the agency is charged with policing many of which have helped him advance his political career . The impact would stretch from the nation ’s waterways to the planet ’s climate since the E. P. A. carries out and enforces rules to combat global warming . “ He has advocated and stood up for the profits of business be it the poultry companies or the energy industry and other polluters at the expense of people who have to drink the water or breathe the air ” said Mark Derichsweiler who led the Oklahoma Department of Environmental Quality division responsible for overseeing the cleanup . Mr. Derichsweiler retired in 2015 after 40 years with the state frustrated with Mr. Pruitt ’s approach . Mr. Pruitt declined a request to comment . But his supporters contend that his record demonstrates a deeply held philosophy that states understand their needs best and should be allowed to regulate their own environment . On Thursday a coalition of 23 powerful conservative advocacy groups endorsed Mr. Pruitt ’s nomination in advance of his confirmation hearing set for Wednesday . “ Some claim Mr. Pruitt opposes clean air and water . This could not be further from the truth ” wrote the groups
1.0"Here are the week ’s top stories and a look ahead . 1. By the end of this week the U. S. will have sworn in a new president . Ahead of Donald J. Trump ’s inauguration on Friday more of his cabinet nominees will appear before Senate committees for confirmation hearings . Last week ’s hearings revealed that many of the people he ’s chosen have strong disagreements with his policies . If his appointments are confirmed he ’ll put in place a team that is more white and male than any cabinet since Ronald Reagan’s . _____ 2. We spoke with some of the millions of women who voted for Mr. Trump like Taylor Davis above who said she was a “ Bernie supporter . ” “ When he backed Hillary Clinton I couldn ’t get behind it ” she said . The women gave a range of reasons for their support for Mr. Trump including concerns about the economy immigration and Mrs. Clinton . _____ 3. Mr. Trump lashed out at Mrs. Clinton after the Justice Department said it would investigate James Comey the F. B. I. director over his decision to tell Congress about a new review of her emails just days before the election . Mr. Trump called her “ guilty as hell . ” He was also mad about a sensational but entirely unverified dossier on his ties to Russia . “ Totally made up facts by sleazebag political operatives ” he tweeted . _____ 4. Congress moved quickly last week in its efforts to repeal the Affordable Care Act which was one of Mr. Trump ’s campaign promises . He also promised it would be replaced by “ something terrific ” but Republicans are far from reaching a consensus on what that would be . Here ’s a look at the major changes Obamacare brought to health care which of those changes may now disappear and what might replace them . _____ 5. Secretary of State John Kerry will spend his last week in office in much the same way as he spent a lot of it : traveling . The trip began with a stop in Vietnam on Friday
" If Donald J. Trump ’s first news conference as was a raucous chaotic affair on Wednesday — and it was — the parody of it on “ Saturday Night Live ” was somehow calmer and more organized than the actual event . Still the “ S. N. L. ” sketch pulled few punches as it swung at the show ’s most powerful persistent critic mocking Mr. Trump on a range of subjects including the perceived lack of star power at his coming inauguration his opaque plan to divest himself from his businesses and the possibility that Russia possessed unverified compromising information on him . Saturday night ’s episode the first new one of 2017 once again featured Alec Baldwin as Mr. Trump . He started off the faux news conference by vowing to answer what he said was “ the question that ’s on everyone ’s mind . ” “ Yes this is real life ” he said . “ This is really happening . On January 20 I Donald J. Trump will become the 45th president of the United States . ” He continued : “ And then two months later Mike Pence will become the 46th . ” Listing the performers who are scheduled for his inauguration he cited the rock band 3 Doors Down “ Jackie What ’ ” from “ America ’s Got Talent ” and “ the one Rockette with the least money in her savings . ” ( He also said the actors Angelina Jolie Ryan Gosling and Jennifer Lawrence would be in attendance “ courtesy of Madame Tussauds . ” ) Turning to questions from reporters played by the “ S. N. L. ” cast Mr. pointedly refused to answer questions about an alleged compromising videotape because he said
" A few weeks after the election of Donald J. Trump pundits with their eyes glued to Twitter believed they ’d finally deciphered the master plan behind the ’s tweeting . Every time he detonated a bomb on Twitter they suspected it was a sly bid to divert the public eye from more serious news about his impending administration . So when Mr. Trump reignited the dormant debate over flag burning one morning — tweeting that those who set fire to the flag should suffer “ loss of citizenship or year in jail ! ” — New York magazine ’s Jonathan Chait quickly produced a column decoding the message . He called it a “ strange fight ” and a “ classic nationalist distraction ” that proves Mr. Trump ’s “ dangerous and authoritarian politics is calculated and not merely crazy . ” But soon a competing theory emerged : Minutes before Mr. Trump ’s tweet “ Fox Friends ” one of the ’s favorite shows ran a segment referencing an American flag burned on a college campus to protest his victory . He wasn ’t carrying out some strategy . He was his TV . Twitter is an impulsive medium . Log in and you ’re greeted immediately with a text box asking “ What ’s happening ? ” — as in right this second . Mr. Trump who is set to become the nation ’s 45th president on Friday is a master of Twitter but also in its thrall . Theories of some grand Trump Twitter plot forget that impetuous and aggressive tweeting has been a habit of Mr. Trump ’s for years . He famously avoids alcohol Twitter is his vice . And after eight years of posts from @BarackObama equally journalists are transfixed by Mr. Trump ’s timeline too . Mr. Trump has always been hooked on recognition . He is obsessed with his television ratings . His office is festooned with magazine covers featuring himself . Even negative attention can be a win he ’s thrilled to be named Time ’s “ Person of the Year ” even if the cover might evoke images of both Hitler and Satan . But today magazine covers and TV hits lack the cultural dominance they once held . ( As Mr. Trump tweeted in 2013 Time “ looks really flimsy like a free handout at a parking lot ! ” ) Now he ’s found a medium where recognition arrives every fraction of a second and his reach is quantified in real time — ratings but for every sentence you ever write . Scroll through the list of accounts Mr. Trump follows and you ’ll find a tightly curated crew of Trump relatives ( like Ivanka ) properties ( Trump Waikiki ) celebrities ( Roma Downey wife to “ The Apprentice ” producer Mark Burnett ) and reliably outlets ( “ Fox Friends ” naturally ) . It ’s a remarkable picture of social media restraint for Twitter ’s most uninhibited star and it gives a glimpse at the image Mr. Trump intends to project : devoted family man
" WASHINGTON — Just days before Donald J. Trump raises his hand to take the oath of office police departments in Chicago and Baltimore have agreed to federal overhauls Cubans no longer have an easy route to residency in the United States and new civil rights monuments in Alabama and South Carolina are on the books . Still in the works as the seconds tick by for President Obama : a negotiated release of American hostages in Afghanistan another lengthy list of reduced prison sentences for nonviolent drug offenders and a raft of appointments to obscure but important federal boards and commissions . And in the face of Mr. Trump ’s repeated questioning about whether the United States was getting value for its security dollars in supporting NATO American tanks began rolling into Poland on Thursday making good on a promise by Mr. Obama to help Eastern European countries counter Russia ’s president Vladimir V. Putin . Mr. Obama ’s last moments in the White House are being filled with one announcement after another each intended to bring efforts to a conclusion before members of his administration unplug their computers turn off the lights and leave their offices for the last time . Michael Brune the executive director of the Sierra Club praised the president for acting to his successor by designating three civil rights sites ensuring that they are guaranteed recognition and protection “ just days before Donald Trump takes office . ” So far Mr. Obama has not issued any surprise pardons — though he has every right to exercise that power through his final day in office the way President Bill Clinton pardoned Marc Rich a tax fugitive . At the same time some things are already out of Mr. Obama ’s reach . Federal law will not allow him to release more detainees from Guantánamo Bay after four more were released on Jan. 5. There is not enough time to finish the legal framework to regulate emissions from airplanes . And officials say there are no more monuments or federal parks to be designated before the transfer of power . But taken together the administration ’s push is an added aggravation to Mr. Trump and members of his transition team who are anxiously counting the time until they take over . “ It ’s the actions of someone who isn ’t fully satisfied with what he was able to do
" LONDON — If British plans for leaving the European Union have been a dance of the seven veils the British government removed one of them on Sunday letting slip to news media that Prime Minister Theresa May is likely to choose to exit Europe ’s single market and its customs union — a hard Brexit . Mrs. May is scheduled to make a speech on her plans on Tuesday but the British weekend papers and Sunday news programs were briefed by Downing Street about the main lines of the policy and some published selected quotations of what Mrs. May is scheduled to say . Officially a government spokesman on Sunday called the reports “ speculation ” and emphasized only the extracts of the speech that were leaked by Downing Street itself with Mrs. May calling for British unity “ to make a success of Brexit and build a truly global Britain . ” Those extracts were not explicit on the single market or the customs union but the Sunday newspapers which receive their own briefings from the government before publication took much the same line : that Britain is headed for a sharp break with Europe after a transitional period . Downing Street dislikes the term “ hard Brexit ” but an outcome along those lines is not unexpected because it flows logically from the priorities Mrs. May has set out particularly about controlling the country ’s borders . Being outside the single market could damage Britain ’s important financial services sector and is likely to hit the value of the pound again at least temporarily . A week ago Mrs. May said in a television interview that Britain would not be able to keep “ bits ” of its European Union membership . That too was interpreted as a break with the single market which requires freedom of movement and labor for all citizens of the bloc . “ Often people talk in terms as if somehow we are leaving the E. U. but we still want to kind of keep bits of membership ” she said then . “ We are leaving . We are coming out . We are not going to be a member of the E. U. any longer . ” She added “ We will be able to have control of our borders control of our laws . ” She and her officials have made it clear that her two main priorities are ending the jurisdiction of the European Court of Justice over British law
" READING England — With its robotics Magal Engineering ’s factory in the colorless outskirts of this busy commercial town west of London is an important component of Britain ’s booming car industry churning out millions of sophisticated vehicle parts every year . Yet as Britain prepares to leave the European Union Magal is having to rethink its operations here . The company has sister factories in France and Germany imports components from them to assemble in Reading and sends many finished products back across the English Channel — all with minimal paperwork and no tariffs . Britain ’s departure from the European Union could change all that ending the trade that Magal enjoys potentially disrupting the hiring of crucial engineers from abroad and requiring new hires to keep up with the added paperwork . Britain ’s exit is a “ big worry ” and ideally would be stopped says Gamil Magal Magal Engineering ’s chief executive . But as a realist he is preparing to live with it . That means suspending investment in Britain and contemplating production cuts here even as the company continues to put money into France . With Britain the policy is “ wait and see ” Mr. Magal said speaking in his office above this bustling factory in a building that once produced World War II aircraft . Although Britain ’s economy has so far not suffered the economic blowback that many predicted would follow the vote in a referendum last year to quit the bloc British companies that import or export goods and services are anxiously assessing the potential costs of departure . Complicating matters is continuing uncertainty over the terms of departure that the government wants to negotiate . Prime Minister Theresa May plans to start two years of formal talks with the European Union on Britain ’s withdrawal widely known as Brexit by the end of March and on Tuesday she is expected to give some more detail about her objectives . “ We don ’t know what is going to happen
" SAN FRANCISCO — Innate Immunotherapeutics is a tiny pharmaceutical company from Australia that has no approved drugs and no backing from flashy venture capital firms and trades for just over a dollar a share on the Australian Stock Exchange . More than once the company has run out of money and nearly closed its doors . But despite its unremarkable profile Innate has some surprisingly influential boosters in Washington . The congressional liaison to Donald J. Trump ’s transition team Representative Chris Collins Republican of New York is the company ’s largest shareholder and sits on the board . Representative Tom Price of Georgia Mr. Trump ’s nominee to be secretary of health and human services purchased shares of Innate four times in 2015 and 2016 according to congressional financial disclosures totaling between $ 60 000 and $ 110 000 . Other Washington power players with investments in the company include Michael Hook Mr. Collins ’s chief of staff who is a top shareholder and Bill Paxon a Washington lobbyist and former congressman according to company filings and congressional financial disclosures . Last summer Mr. Price Mr. Hook and Mr. Paxon bought the stock at a discount as part of a private offering organized by Innate aimed at “ sophisticated U. S. investors . ” They have since quintupled their money at least on paper . Mr. Price ’s investments in health care companies
" Collin Bond had no intention of buying a $ 1 400 Thermador warming drawer when he and his wife Ashley popped into the Habitat for Humanity ReStore in New Rochelle N. Y. in the spring of 2015 . But when he spotted one at the nonprofit store for the price of $ 50 he immediately scooped it up . No matter that the couple were living in a rental in Downtown Brooklyn and had only just begun their search for a Westchester County in earnest . “ I didn ’t have a place to put it at the time but I took it ” said Mr. Bond 36 an associate broker at Douglas Elliman in Manhattan who had an idea of how expensive the drawer normally was from his work in the industry . “ Fifty dollars that ’s crazy ! ” he said recalling his thoughts at the time . “ I wonder what else I can do ? ” Ms. Bond 31 who works in public relations for the home and design industry approved . “ I honestly didn ’t see the need for a warming drawer but liked the way he was thinking . ” And so with his wife ’s blessing and a warming drawer in the trunk of his car Mr. Bond began his quest for a kitchen on the cheap . It wasn ’t long before he spotted a Wolf microwave normally at least $ 1 000

With a couple of taps on his phone he lines up rides with Via a service that shuttles him around Manhattan with strangers for a flat rate of $ 5. When he wants to ride alone he taps again this time summoning a car through Uber . “ I used to go out and hail a cab but this is more convenient ” said Mr. McFadden 47 a photographer . “ We all use our phones all day every day . ” The yellow cab may be as synonymous with New York as pizza Broadway and the Empire State Building but more and more it is no longer the ride of choice . This fixture of city life — a touchstone of popular culture in movies like “ Taxi Driver ’ ’ and the hit television series “ Taxi ” — was once the main alternative to subways and buses hailed by rich and poor alike . Cabdrivers were the ambassadors of the streets welcoming newcomers passing along city lore and dispensing advice even when no one asked .

" Jeanette Lilly Hunt was 18 when her rented a room in his Camden N. J. home to two students who were studying across the Delaware River at the Crozer Theological Seminary . Mrs. Hunt who is now 85 said she did not pay much attention to either student until her Benjamin Hunt and Ulysses Wiggins the president of the Camden County branch of the N. A. A. C. P. helped the students file a police complaint . The complaint was against Ernest Nichols a white tavern owner in Maple Shade N. J. and said that he had refused to serve the black students and their dates in June 1950 and had threatened them by firing a gun in the air . The complaint was signed by the two students . One of the signatures in a loopy slanted cursive reads “ M. L. King Jr . ” M. L. King Jr . who was then 21 listed his address as 753 Walnut Street Mr. Hunt ’s home . The home which has been empty for decades is still owned by Mrs. Hunt who said the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr . was like a member of the family when he lived there from 1949 to 1951 .

" Road teams finally found the success they were missing in this season ’s playoffs with Green Bay and Pittsburgh advancing to the conference championships . Both will have to repeat that road success if either team wants to make it to Super Bowl LI in Houston as the Packers will travel to Atlanta and the Steelers will be on their way to New England . Here ’s a quick preview of the conference championships : No. 4 Green Bay Packers ( ) at No. 2 Atlanta Falcons ( ) Time : 3:05 p. m. Eastern Fox Spread : Falcons are favored by 4. They say “ defense wins championships ” but the N. F. C. will almost assuredly be decided by which team ’s superstar quarterbacks is able to do more damage . Aaron Rodgers has led the Green Bay Packers to eight consecutive wins repeatedly delivering under intense pressure and Matt Ryan looks like a completely different player than the one who struggled in recent seasons . Green Bay will be trying to win a a second consecutive playoff game on the road and Atlanta after an easy win over Seattle in the divisional round will be trying to reach the Super Bowl for the first time since the 1998 season . No. 3 Pittsburgh Steelers ( ) at No. 1 New England Patriots ( ) Time : 6:40 p. m. Eastern CBS Spread : Patriots are favored by 6. At one point during the season the Patriots seemed nearly unbeatable but they have had to work far harder in recent weeks to keep things going . The Steelers meanwhile have hit their stride defensively with an offense led by the usual suspects of Ben Roethlisberger Le’Veon Bell and Antonio Brown . It will be New England ’s 11th appearance in the A. F. C. championship game in the 16 seasons of the Tom Brady Era and the team will be trying to reach the Super Bowl for the seventh time in that span . The Steelers who have won two Super Bowls with Roethlisberger are hoping to make an appearance in the game for the fourth time in 12 seasons . Here ’s how all four teams got here : It may not have been the type of game the Pittsburgh Steelers prefer to play with all of the team ’s scoring coming from their kicker ’s foot but in the playoffs a win is a win . And the Steelers ’ ugly victory over the Kansas City Chiefs was just enough to earn the team a trip to New England to face the Patriots in the A. F. C. championship game . It was a game largely defined by Pittsburgh ’s inability to punch the ball into the end zone after moving the ball well between the lines . The game ’s biggest moment came near the end when Sean Davis
" Much of the credit for the remarkable rise of the Dallas Cowboys from last season to this season has gone to two rookies : quarterback Dak Prescott and running back Ezekiel Elliott . But insiders will tell you that the real secret to the Cowboys ’ success is their offensive line which by most accounts is the best in the N. F. L. Whether blocking for Elliott or giving Prescott the time he needs to find an open receiver Dallas ’s dominant line is the constant that has driven the team forward . It is difficult to scientifically assess the merits of an offensive line . Linemen do not compile straightforward statistics like yardage or touchdowns . But measures that do exist point to the Cowboys ’ line as elite . Three of the five starters have been chosen to the Pro Bowl a total matched only by the Oakland Raiders . It is the fourth consecutive Pro Bowl selection for left tackle Tyron Smith and the third straight for center Travis Frederick and right guard Zack Martin . The line is rounded out by left guard Ronald Leary subbing for the injured La’el Collins and the veteran right tackle Doug Free . “ I have always felt that the offensive line are the heartbeat for a franchise ” Troy Aikman the former Cowboys quarterback said . “ If you ’ve got tough physical offensive linemen then your team is going to be tough and physical . That becomes what your identity is . ” Aikman will be calling Dallas ’s game against the Green Bay Packers on Sunday for Fox . Others around the N. F. L. agree . “ The offensive line is unbelievable ” Vikings Coach Mike Zimmer told reporters in November . “ They ’re by far the best in the league that I ’ve seen . Smith is the best lineman in the league by far . But they ’ve got a lot of big physical guys . ” Elliott thought enough of his linemen to give them all John Deere vehicles for Christmas . Focusing on the offensive line has been a conscious decision by Coach Jason Garrett and the Cowboys . “ The background that Jason has his beliefs come from the years we shared together with the Cowboys in the ” Aikman said . “ His interest was building the offensive line . They built their offense around the power running game . ” The Cowboys had not used a pick on a blocker since 1981 eight years before Jerry Jones bought the team . But a run of three in four years — Smith in 2011 Frederick in 2013 and Martin in 2014 — laid the foundation for the corps now in place . Using a system that includes statistics like yards before contact on running plays and sacks hits and hurries on passing plays Pro Football Focus ranked the Cowboys ’ offensive line the best in the league
" KANSAS CITY Mo . — The most important play in football as far as the Kansas City Chiefs are concerned is not a long gain on first down or a defensive stop on . It is the punt the humble and anyone who rebuts this point with Dave Toub does so at his own peril . Toub is the team ’s coordinator the mastermind behind an elite unit one that has fueled the Chiefs ’ rise to A. F. C. contender and also his own candidacy for head coaching openings . But before Toub directed a group that has dominated field position and returned nine kickoffs or punts for touchdowns during his four seasons in Kansas City he was a novice . His first job in that area came during his first season as an N. F. L. coach — in 2001 when his current boss Andy Reid hired him as a assistant to the coordinator John Harbaugh in Philadelphia . Early conversations with Harbaugh now a Super coach in Baltimore inculcated the magnitude of the punt . Toub who was the Chicago Bears ’ coordinator for nine seasons after leaving Philadelphia considers the punt an offensive play and no other offensive play registers the same consistent impact . It averages more than 40 yards . It flips field position . It determines outcomes . “ My philosophy is if you punt well cover well and play good defense you ’ll be in every game ” Toub said in an interview last week . The Chiefs who play the Pittsburgh Steelers on Sunday night in the playoffs applied that philosophy en route to going their best record since 2003 and winning the A. F. C. West for the first time in six seasons . Toub stresses it to newcomers and stalwarts alike in meeting rooms and on the practice field
" JIUQUAN China — On the edge of the Gobi Desert the Jiuquan Wind Power Base stands as a symbol of China ’s quest to dominate the world ’s renewable energy market . With more than 7000 turbines arranged in rows that stretch along the sandy horizon it is one of the world ’s largest wind farms capable of generating enough electricity to power a small country . But these days the windmills loom like scarecrows idle and inert . The wind howls outside but many turbines in Jiuquan a city of vast deserts and farms in the northwest province of Gansu have been shut off because of weak demand . Workers while away the hours calculating how much power the turbines could have generated if there were more buyers and wondering if and when they will ever make a profit . “ There ’s not much we can do right now ” said Zhou Shenggang a manager at a energy company who oversees 134 turbines here about 60 percent of their capacity goes unused each year . “ Only the state can intervene . ” China the world ’s largest emitter of greenhouse gases has pointed to its embrace of wind and solar power and other alternatives to coal to position itself at the forefront of the global effort to combat climate change . More than 92000 wind turbines have been built across the country capable of generating 145 gigawatts of electricity nearly double the capacity of wind farms in the United States . One out of every three turbines in the world is now in China and the government is adding them at a rate of more than one per hour . But some of its most ambitious wind projects are underused . Many are grappling with a nationwide economic slowdown that has dampened demand for electricity . Others are stymied by persistent favoritism toward the coal industry by local officials and a dearth of transmission lines to carry electricity from rural areas in the north and west to China ’s cities . That has left China unable to generate enough renewable energy to make a serious dent in air pollution and carbon emissions despite the building spree . Even with its unmatched arsenal of turbines

" RIO DE JANEIRO — The death toll from a riot in a penitentiary in northeastern Brazil rose on Sunday to 26 prisoners increasing the number of prison killings in the country this year to more than 120 . Decapitations and mutilations are common in Brazil ’s violent overcrowded prisons in which 40 percent of inmates have yet to be sentenced but the latest wave of brutality has appalled many here . The riot began around 5 p. m. on Saturday at the State Penitentiary of Alcaçuz 13 miles from Natal in the state of Rio Grande do Norte and continued until around 7 a. m. on Sunday when riot police officers took control of the prison . “ The situation of the rebellion is controlled ” said Maj. Eduardo Franco of the Rio Grande do Norte police . On Sunday the authorities initially said they had found 27 bodies but the death toll was later revised to 26 Major Franco said there had been a mistake . Many of the bodies were mutilated . The prison has a capacity of 620 but was holding around 1100 prisoners when the riot began the authorities said . All of the inmates had been sentenced Major Franco added . Wilma Batista the director of the prison agents ’ union in Rio Grande do Norte sent a photograph of two headless mutilated corpses in a prison yard via a cellphone messaging service and said she had seen many others . “ We are shocked ” she said . With Brazil swamped in recession President Michel Temer ’s government reeling from one graft scandal after another and a wave of seemingly uncontrollable prison violence
" LOS ANGELES — Dead . Embalmed . Buried . A year ago that is what most movie studios would have said about musicals pointing to a long line of box office calamities : “ Rock of Ages ” “ Burlesque ” “ Jersey Boys ” “ Across the Universe ” “ Nine . ” The few successes in recent decades have been adaptations of Broadway classics ( “ Les Misérables ” 2012 ) or marketed in misleading ways . When 20th Century Fox was selling Baz Luhrmann ’s hit “ Moulin Rouge ! ” in 2001 the studio was so afraid that people would stay home if they knew it was a musical that the trailer rather awkwardly tried to avoid singing at all costs . But Hollywood excited in part by the critical and commercial success of “ La La Land ” which cost Lionsgate $ 30 million to make and has taken in $ 132 million worldwide as it streaks toward the Academy Awards is taking out its jazz hands again . There are roughly 20 musicals in the works at studios according to the film database IMDBpro . Some are adaptations of classic animated musicals like “ Beauty and the Beast ” directed by Bill Condon and set for release by Disney in March . Others are films ( among them “ Wicked ” ) based on contemporary Broadway hits . Moreover several studios — for the first time since the 1990 s — are devoting meaningful resources to films with original music . This year Fox will release “ The Greatest Showman ” which stars Hugh Jackman as the circus impresario P. T. Barnum it has a dozen original songs . Disney has “ Bob the Musical ” about a man whose life becomes filled with song after a head injury . Universal Pictures won a bidding war for an untitled musical comedy starring Josh Gad
" American novelists have long complained about the ability of real life to outstrip fiction . In his landmark 1961 essay “ Writing American Fiction ” Philip Roth observed that “ actuality is continually outdoing our talents and the culture tosses up figures almost daily that are the envy of any novelist . ” The figure Roth cites is Charles Van Doren of scandal fame but place Mr. Van Doren next to Donald J. Trump and you can measure the change in the nature of credibility over the past . Mr. Van Doren was disgraced when it was revealed that he had been given the answers to the questions on the game show “ ” a contest that television viewers believed was real not staged . Today an entire flourishing genre of television goes by the name “ reality ” yet no one who watches it thinks it is genuinely real — that is unplanned and unedited . Artificiality is what makes reality television enjoyable even though these same shows if advertised as fiction would appear banal repetitive and undramatic . Reality is the ingredient that turns a bad fiction into an enthralling one . This dynamic is part of the novel ’s origins . The earliest English novels from “ Moll Flanders ” ( 1722 ) to “ Clarissa ” ( 1748 ) were published anonymously with titles that implied they were true stories . It took generations to establish the conventions of fiction sufficiently to allow readers to take pleasure in novels that were explicitly untrue . The suspension of disbelief that fiction involves is a late stage in the evolution of taste and it may prove to have been a temporary one . The rise of the memoir over the past few decades doesn ’t mean that readers are ready to abandon the techniques of fiction but like readers three centuries ago they want the freedom of fiction along with consequentiality of fact . The author David Shields diagnosed this desire in his 2010 manifesto “ Reality Hunger ” : “ I find it very nearly impossible to read a contemporary novel that presents itself as a novel . ” Many fiction writers share this intuition though they respond to it in different ways . One way is to make the novel by turning its imitation of reality into an exaggeration a mirror . Has our reality since felt apocalyptic ? Then imagine Manhattan being destroyed by zombies ( Colson Whitehead ’s “ Zone One ” ) or a flood ( Nathaniel Rich ’s “ Odds Against Tomorrow ” ) or civil war and foreign bankers ( Gary Shteyngart ’s “ Super Sad True Love Story ” ) . Because we know such things “ could never happen ” they mark the story as fiction because we know similar things have happened and will happen they become truthful fictions . An alternative approach is to make fiction as close to fact as possible
" He called NATO obsolete . He said Germany ’s acceptance of refugees is “ utterly catastrophic . ” The One China policy embraced by the United States ? That ’s up for discussion . Just days before Donald J. Trump ’s inauguration world leaders on three continents are on edge after comments the made in an interview on Friday with The Wall Street Journal and in a weekend interview with two European newspapers Bild and The Times of London . “ It ’s obsolete first because it was designed many many years ago ” Mr. Trump said according to the German newspaper Bild . The alliance born in 1949 three years after Mr. Trump is viewed by many — including his nominee for defense secretary Gen. James N. Mattis — as essential to American security . “ Secondly countries aren ’t paying what they should ” and NATO “ didn ’t deal with terrorism . ” Responding on Monday to Mr. Trump ’s comments Dalia Grybauskaite the president of Lithuania which gained its independence from the Soviet Union in 1991 and joined NATO in 2004 urged Mr. Trump to continue meeting the United States ’ financial obligations toward the alliance . Mr. Trump also criticized the European Union describing it as “ basically a vehicle for Germany . ” He praised Britain for its vote to leave the bloc known as Brexit adding : “ I believe others will leave . I do think keeping it together is not going to be as easy as a lot of people think . ” French leaders also bristled at Mr. Trump ’s swipe against the bloc . Their response comes as they deal with growing domestic support for the Union and party National Front led by Marine Le Pen
" WASHINGTON — Since the emergence of an unverified dossier with salacious claims about Donald J. Trump Americans have debated the ramifications of the arrival of “ kompromat ” as a feature of American politics . But those debates — for example over the ethics of publishing the dossier — have often framed this practice as little more than a political form of blackmail and one particular to Russia . In fact kompromat is more than an individual piece of damaging information : It is a broader attempt to manufacture public cynicism and confusion in ways that target not just one individual but an entire society . And although this practice tends to be associated with Russia — the word kompromat is a portmanteau of the Russian words for “ compromising ” and “ information ” — it is a common feature of authoritarian and semiauthoritarian nations around the world . Specific leaks may take aim at powerful individuals but in the longer term kompromat serves the interests of the powerful which is why it is often a tool of autocrats . By eroding the very idea of a shared reality and by spreading apathy and confusion among a public that learns to distrust leaders and institutions alike kompromat undermines a society ’s ability to hold the powerful to account and ensure the proper functioning of government . When Katy E. Pearce a professor of communications at the University of Washington in Seattle began studying access to technology in Azerbaijan she expected to focus her research on how it could be a positive tool for promoting political freedom . But she changed her tack after encountering widespread fear of the ways that the government could use technology as a tool of repression . “ When I was interviewing people it kept on coming up and coming up ” she said . Kompromat is “ a very cheap and easy way for the regime to demonstrate its power and to harass people in a very visible way ” she added . That was a danger and a deterrent for the young activists she spoke to . But individual targets of kompromat are not its only victims Professor Pearce said . It also harms society by diminishing public trust . Thomas Rid a professor of security studies at King ’s College London wrote on Twitter that disinformation campaigns have “ often deliberately blended accurate and forged details ” to sow distrust and confusion . If the news media and public figures publicize lies they lose their credibility as trustworthy sources of information . “ There ’s no reliable truth to rest upon
" It was 2005 and Felix Sater a Russian immigrant was back in Moscow pursuing an ambitious plan to build a Trump tower on the site of an old pencil factory along the Moscow River that would offer hotel rooms condominiums and commercial office space . Letters of intent had been signed and square footage was being analyzed . “ There was an opportunity to explore building Trump towers internationally ” said Mr. Sater who worked for a New development company that was a partner with Donald J. Trump on a variety of deals during that decade . “ And Russia was one of those countries . ” The ’s favorable comments about President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia and the conclusion of United States intelligence officials that Moscow acted to help Mr. Trump ’s campaign have focused attention on Mr. Trump ’s business interests in Russia . Asked about the issue at his news conference last week Mr. Trump was emphatic on one point : “ I have no dealings with Russia . ” And he repeated “ I have no deals that could happen in Russia because we ’ve stayed away . ” The project on the old pencil factory site ultimately fizzled . And by the time Mr. Trump entered the presidential race he had failed to get any real estate development off the ground in Russia . But it was not for lack of trying . Mr. Trump repeatedly sought business in Russia as far back as 1987 when he traveled there to explore building a hotel . He applied for his trademark in the country as early as 1996 . And his children and associates have appeared in Moscow over and over in search of joint ventures meeting with developers and government officials . During a trip in 2006 Mr. Sater and two of Mr. Trump ’s children Donald Jr . and Ivanka stayed at the historic Hotel National Moscow opposite the Kremlin connecting with potential partners over the course of several days . As recently as 2013 Mr. Trump himself was in Moscow . He had sold Russian real estate developers the right to host his Miss Universe pageant that year and he used the visit as a chance to discuss development deals writing on Twitter at the time : “ TRUMP is next . ” As the Russian market opened up in the era Mr. Trump and his partners pursued Russians who were newly flush with cash to buy apartments in Trump Towers in New York and Florida
" WASHINGTON — With tensions escalating between Donald J. Trump and prominent black leaders Mr. Trump met privately on Monday with the eldest son of the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr . on the holiday devoted to the civil rights hero . The hastily arranged meeting at Trump Tower occurred as Mr. Trump feuded publicly with Representative John Lewis Democrat of Georgia who fought for civil rights alongside Dr. King . It has highlighted the challenges Mr. Trump faces as he prepares to take office on Friday deeply distrusted by minorities across the country many of whom have been offended by his false allegations that President Obama was born outside the United States appalled that his candidacy drew backing from white supremacist organizations and dismayed at policy proposals they consider antithetical to their interests . Mr. Trump on Monday did not address those issues appearing in the lobby to allow news cameras to capture pictures of him shaking hands with Martin Luther King III but ignoring questions shouted by reporters about their conversation or his statements about Mr. Lewis . Tentative plans for Mr. Trump to visit the Smithsonian Museum of History and Culture in Washington as the nation paused to remember Dr. King had been shelved in favor of the session which lasted just under one hour . But Mr. Trump made sure that journalists had an opportunity to see him with Mr. King a visual manifestation of his stated aspiration to unite a divided nation . Mr. King said the session which included a discussion about voting rights had been “ constructive ” and described Mr. Trump as eager to present himself as inclusive . “ He said that he is going to represent Americans — he ’s said that over and over again ” Mr. King the president of the Drum Major Institute a progressive New public policy organization told reporters . “ We will continue to evaluate that . ” On Monday
" Today is Martin Luther King ’s Birthday the federal holiday that honors the assassinated civil rights leader . Well not everywhere . All 50 states celebrate the public holiday on the third Monday in January but not all states cities and towns dedicate it solely to the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr . Some package it as a broader celebration of both Dr. King and Confederate leaders . naming differences are remnants of fierce opposition to a holiday that was not officially recognized by all states until 1999 . Here is a brief history of how Martin Luther King Jr . Day came to be . How Did Martin Luther King Jr . Day Become a Holiday ? A federal holiday honoring Dr. King was first proposed four days after he was assassinated in 1968 but it took almost two decades of campaigning for it to be approved and designated at the national level . In the meantime according to the King Center a few Northern states approved the holiday from 1973 to 1975 : Illinois Massachusetts Connecticut and by court order New Jersey . But momentum slowed and Congress did not act . Advocates led by Dr. King ’s widow Coretta Scott King spent years lobbying for the holiday testifying before Congress and gathering millions of signatures on petitions . President Jimmy Carter expressed support for the federal holiday in 1979 . The singer Stevie Wonder became a prominent supporter too financing a Washington lobbying office and releasing a hit 1980 song in support “ Happy Birthday . ” The campaign finally succeeded in 1983 when Congress passed the King Holiday Bill and President Ronald Reagan signed it into law . The third Monday in January would be celebrated as Martin Luther King Jr . Day starting in 1986 . Who Opposed It ? Proposals to honor Dr. King met strong resistance in Congress and when the holiday was enacted
" ROSWELL Ga . — It was 1 in the morning and the orthopedic surgeon on call was preparing to operate on a woman whose foot had been shattered in a car wreck after hours of tending to other patients . The woman ’s husband Jeff Anderson asked him “ Are you too tired to do this ? ” “ He looked me straight in the eye — very quiet guy — and said ‘ I was born to do this ’ ” Mr. Anderson recalled . The surgeon that night more than 20 years ago was Representative Tom Price of Georgia Donald J. Trump ’s nominee for secretary of health and human services the cabinet official who will lead the new administration ’s efforts to dismantle the Affordable Care Act . Since then the assuredness that defined Mr. Price as a surgeon has carried into his political career . He has always listened politely to other viewpoints but never swerved from his policy mission to protect his former profession from what he views as government intrusion . Many who knew Mr. Price as a doctor here in Atlanta ’s affluent northern suburbs praise his commitment to his patients . But his legislative record shows that over eight years in the Georgia Senate and 12 years in Congress he has advocated at least as much for physician groups and health care companies — seeking to limit damages in malpractice cases for instance and voting against legislation that would have required the government to negotiate lower drug prices for Medicare beneficiaries . Mr. Price has routinely argued that patients are the driving force behind his efforts . Still his positions have often coincided with the financial interests of groups whose donations have helped advance his political career . Doctors themselves are sharply divided over his nomination and some are particularly galled by Mr. Price ’s enmity for the Affordable Care Act and opposition to abortion rights . Some of his positions even clash with those of Mr. Trump who wants to pressure pharmaceutical companies on drug prices for example and has pledged to largely leave Medicare alone . If confirmed Mr. Price
" Monica Crowley who was selected just weeks ago to serve in a post on Donald J. Trump ’s National Security Council has decided against taking the position after allegations that she plagiarized key passages in a 2012 book . Ms. Crowley whose name was briefly floated as a candidate for White House press secretary has been dogged by accusations of plagiarism in recent weeks beginning with the discovery by CNN that she copied several passages in a book she published with HarperCollins . A later report in Politico unearthed similar issues in her doctoral dissertation . “ After much reflection I have decided to remain in New York to pursue other opportunities and will not be taking a position in the incoming administration ” Ms. Crowley said in a statement to The Washington Times . “ I greatly appreciate being asked to be part of Trump ’s team and I will continue to enthusiastically support him and his agenda for American renewal ” she said . She did not address the allegations of plagiarism . Ms. Crowley is the second official announced by the transition team to decide not to go to the White House following Jason Miller who was to be the communications director . One person close to the transition said that Ms. Crowley ’s role would have involved overseeing certain speeches something that would have been difficult after the plagiarism claims . HarperCollins has withdrawn the digital edition of Ms. Crowley ’s book “ What the ( Bleep ) Just Happened ? ” Published by Broadside Books a conservative imprint at HarperCollins it is a critical look at Barack Obama ’s presidency . It sold out 20000 copies in hardcover Publishers Marketplace said . Mr. Trump ’s transition team had labeled the plagiarism reports “ a politically motivated attack ” and defended Ms. Crowley ’s ability to serve . “ Monica ’s exceptional insight and thoughtful work on how to turn this country around is exactly why she will be serving in the administration ” transition officials said in a statement to CNN . “ HarperCollins — one of the largest and most respected publishers in the world — published her book which has become a national best seller ” the statement said . “ Any attempt to discredit Monica is nothing more than a politically motivated attack that seeks to distract from the real issues facing this country . ” Most publishers do not check for plagiarism
" In his successful runs for state senator in Montana and then for Congress Representative Ryan Zinke has promoted his career in the Navy SEALs as one of his main credentials going so far as to put the SEALs ’ Trident symbol on his campaign bus . While he has portrayed his accomplishments in the Navy in glowing terms Mr. Zinke a Republican and Donald J. Trump ’s nominee for secretary of the interior has acknowledged one “ glitch ” : that he improperly billed the government for travel to his home in Montana when he was a midlevel SEAL Team 6 officer in the late 1990 s . He had to repay $ 211 for one of two trips he has said maintaining that the episode did not derail what he described as a “ brilliant ” career . But two retired admirals under whom Mr. Zinke served say his account understates the damage that it did . Mr. Zinke was in fact punished for abusing his travel expenses they say through an evaluation that prevented him from rising to senior levels in the Navy . His former commanding officer in SEAL Team 6 retired Vice Adm. Albert M. Calland III who had never before discussed the matter publicly said in an interview that it was “ an easy decision ” to hit Mr. Zinke hard over the travel claims which came at a time when he was supposed to help prevent such abuses . “ I gave him a fitness report that I thought would not allow him to get to captain and that seemed in that regard to work O. K. ” Admiral Calland said . Even though Mr. Zinke served in a succession of No. 2 jobs in special operations after that “ he never got command ” the admiral said . Another retired vice admiral
" BEVERLY HILLS Calif. — It was Nov. 12 and Bill Maher was about to begin his comedy act at the City National Civic in San Jose when he did something he hadn ’t done in many years . He brought a drink with him to the stage a standup roadie ( tequila ) . “ And boy did I miss it ” he joked with me last week . “ What an idiot all those years — drinking ’s fun . You hear that kids ? Drinking ’s fun ! ” Actually that ’s not why he did it he said during a marathon session of talking and drinking — and in his case a wee bit of pot smoking — that started at his house here and ended several hours later at the nearby Polo Lounge ( oh the indignities of this job ) . He says he considers drinking on stage unprofessional . But that night so soon after the election he needed something to calm his nerves . Donald J. Trump who Mr. Maher said “ lives for vengeance ” had just won control over the most powerful instruments of the government like the Justice Department and more to the point the F. B. I. And it was dawning on Mr. Maher that “ no one ’s been meaner to him than me . ” Mr. Maher has a unique perspective . He resides at that most treacherous intersection where free speech meets government power and political passion dodging traffic from left and right . He also once accused Mr. Trump of being part orangutan by birth . But first a refresher on how Mr. Maher became a totem in 2001 with one provocative line on his ABC show “ Politically Incorrect . ” He said the Sept. 11 hijackers couldn ’t be called “ cowards
" Michiko Kakutani the chief book critic for The New York Times interviewed President Obama about literature on Friday at the White House . Here are excerpts from the conversation which have been edited and condensed . These books that you gave to your daughter Malia on the Kindle what were they ? Some of your favorites ? I think some of them were sort of the usual suspects so “ The Naked and the Dead ” or “ One Hundred Years of Solitude ” I think she hadn ’t read yet . Then there were some books I think that are not on everybody ’s reading list these days but I remembered as being interesting like “ The Golden Notebook ” by Doris Lessing for example . Or “ The Woman Warrior ” by Maxine [ Hong Kingston ] . Part of what was interesting was me pulling back books that I thought were really powerful but that might not surface when she goes to college . Have you had a chance to discuss them with her ? I ’ve had the chance to discuss some . And she ’s interested in being a filmmaker so storytelling is of great interest to her . She had just read “ A Moveable Feast . ” I hadn ’t included that and she was just captivated by the idea that Hemingway described his goal of writing one true thing every day . What made you want to become a writer ? I loved reading when I was a kid partly because I was traveling so much and there were times where I ’d be displaced I ’d be the outsider . When I first moved to Indonesia I ’m this big kid that kind of stood out . And then when I moved back from Indonesia to Hawaii I had the manners and habits probably of an Indonesian kid . And so the idea of having these worlds that were portable that were yours
" The many men women and children who spend their days glued to their smartphones and social media accounts might learn something from Miranda creator of the groundbreaking megahit “ Hamilton . ” Asked in an interview with Delta Sky magazine when and where he finds time to be creative Mr. Miranda an avid reader of books and enthusiast for unfettered downtime replied : “ The good idea comes in the moment of rest . It comes in the shower . It comes when you ’re doodling or playing trains with your son . ‘ Hamilton ’ forced me to double down on being awake to the inspirations of just living my life . ” Mr. Miranda ’s observation bodes ill for the future not just of creativity but also of healthy bodies minds and relationships . No doubt you ’ve seen the following scenarios probably many times : • Young couples out to dinner pull out their smartphones to check messages emails and social networks even before scanning the menu and check their phones repeatedly throughout the meal . • Shoppers and commuters standing in line people crossing busy streets even cyclists and drivers whose eyes are on their phones instead of their surroundings . • Toddlers in strollers playing with a digital device — a parent ’s or perhaps even their own — instead of observing and learning from the world around them . • People walking down the street with eyes on their phones bumping into others tripping over or crashing into obstacles . Observations like these have prompted a New York psychotherapist to ask “ What really matters ? ” in life . In her enlightening new book “ The Power of Off ” Nancy Colier observes that “ we are spending far too much of our time doing things that don ’t really matter to us . ” Both in and outside her practice she has encountered many people who have become “ disconnected from what really matters from what makes us feel nourished and grounded as human beings . ” The access to digital technology starting at ever younger ages
" The police in Turkey have arrested the man accused of carrying out a deadly attack on an Istanbul nightclub early on New Year ’s Day killing 39 people including a police officer and 25 foreigners according to the semiofficial Anadolu news agency as well as Turkish news reports . The news agency said that a police raid on a residence in the outlying Esenyurt district of Istanbul had resulted in the capture of Abdulgadir Masharipov whom the authorities described as an Islamic State militant of Uzbek nationality along with four other people . The others were a man of Kyrgyz nationality and three women whose nationalities were not given Anadolu said . Turkish news organizations posted photographs of the suspect in custody showing him bruised and with fresh blood on his clothing and face . He had reportedly been injured while carrying out the deadly attack on the Reina nightclub on the Bosporus . An estimated 69 people were wounded by the attacker who went on a shooting rampage with a rifle inside the crowded and popular venue . The Islamic State claimed responsibility for the attack the next day and said in a statement that it had been carried out “ in continuation of the blessed operations that the Islamic State is conducting against Turkey the protector of the cross . ” The Turkish authorities quickly identified the suspect from television and President Recep Tayyip Erdogan vowed to bring him to justice . Turkey ’s foreign minister Mevlut Cavusoglu posted a Twitter message congratulating the country ’s interior minister on the arrest . “ In the name of our nation I thank primarily our minister Suleyman Soylu our police and intelligence organizations who captured Reina assailant ” he wrote .

" DAVOS Switzerland — Donald Trump has never been invited here . Neither has Nigel Farage the British politician who led the Brexit campaign . The World Economic Forum — an annual gathering of global policy and business leaders who come to debate the world ’s great challenges — gets underway here Monday night as the shifting political trends toward nationalism and against a sense of globalism are raising renewed questions about the relevance of the elites known as the “ Davos class . ” It is this group of plutocrats that largely failed to anticipate — and may have even unconsciously generated — the seeping movement across the globe . Every January a glittering array of the cognoscenti descend on the Alps : the Bill Gates the of Microsoft the billionaire investor George Soros Jack Ma the founder of China ’s giant Alibaba and — until recently — Angela Merkel the chancellor of Germany . An assortment of Hollywood actors including Angelina Jolie Leonardo DiCaprio and Matt Damon have made the pilgrimage over the years to promote their nonprofit work . And the conversations tend to be dominated by issues like inequality climate change and the economic challenges facing developed and emerging countries . This year the guest list includes names like President Xi Jinping of China Vice President Joseph Biden JPMorgan Chase ’s chief executive Jamie Dimon the head of the International Monetary Fund Christine Lagarde and former Vice President Al Gore . And yet missing from these conversations have been meaningful challengers or critics of the underlying theme that was seemingly stipulated from the birth of this event 46 years ago : Globalization has the potential to benefit everyone . “ Trump ’s election victory is a clear indication that the majority of people are not interested in a world government but want to return to a classical local democracy ” John Mauldin an economic researcher and author recently wrote . “ Strange as it may seem to the Davos men most people tend to love their ‘ patria ’ the land of their fathers . ” Dissenting voices like those of Mr. Trump and Mr. Farage have rarely been part of the discussion — though perhaps that will change .

" BERLIN — About five decades since the surge in modern feminism it is unlikely that most women — in the United States at least — would have anticipated the current political climate in which gender equality remains almost as elusive as ever and rights are under siege . What is more a man criticized by many for his treatment of women will be sworn in as president of the United States on Friday . And in 2016 a woman still could not be elected to the job . After the gamut of emotions engendered by Hillary Clinton ’s surprising loss to Donald J. Trump women are once more confronting the big questions that have long enveloped the feminist quest . Put bluntly is it sexism or the system that has so far prevented a woman from becoming president of the United States ? And what lessons might be drawn from Europe or places further afield that could help an American woman get to the top one day ? As members of the global elite gather this week at the World Economic Forum in Davos Switzerland gender issues in politics and beyond will be hotly debated . If the fight for women ’s rights has taught activists one thing it is that simple questions have complex answers . Melanne Verveer executive director of the Georgetown Institute for Women Peace and Security and former ambassador at large for global women ’s issues under President Obama said that “ to just look at this election through the gender lens is not to understand it fully . ” Though many women saw Mrs. Clinton a former senator and secretary of state as the most qualified candidate other women felt no tug to help one of their own shatter a glass ceiling and instead “ reached a conclusion that they might be better off with a change ” Ms. Verveer said . “ I think people would like to think there has to be one good explanation ” said Shauna Lani Shames an assistant professor of political science at Rutgers in New Jersey . “ But there is not . It ’s many . ” What she called the “ deeply ingrained sexism ” of a country fond of cowboy myths and tales of the Wild West is one . There are others . For starters
1.0"MELBOURNE Australia — “ So Ivan are you calling Andy ‘ Sir ’ ? ” Ivan Lendl paused and then laughed which would surely seem strange to those who know him only as Andy Murray ’s coach in the front row of the players ’ box . “ Definitely not ” Lendl said chuckling some more before heading off down the crowded main hallway inside Rod Laver Arena at the Australian Open . Clearly not much has changed in the Murray camp since his remarkable stretch run to the No. 1 ranking and a knighthood in 2016 . He is still tough on himself on court and on the changeovers . Still Andy — not Sir Andy — to his peers and mentor in chief Lendl . Still deadpan and droll with his voice that sounds as if it emanates from a mine shaft . Asked on Monday by the interviewer John Fitzgerald how Murray ’s wife Kim was handling the transition to Lady Kim Murray said “ No more swearing during my matches for anyone who saw that a few years ago . ” He was referring to Kim ’s courtside language during his semifinal victory over Tomas Berdych at the 2015 Australian Open . Her tirade did not go unnoticed and she returned for the final cheekily wearing a shirt that read “ Parental advisory explicit content . ” Presumably Lady Kim won ’t be wearing that sort of thing in the players ’ box from here on either ( or at least she wasn ’t on Monday ) . “ I haven ’t found it distracting really ” Murray said of the knighthood . “ I mean I found out about it four or five weeks ago . Maybe if it happened a day or so
" WASHINGTON — The F. B. I. arrested the wife of the man who carried out a deadly terrorist attack in Orlando Fla . and charged her with obstructing the investigation of the mass shooting law enforcement officials said on Monday . Noor Salman whose husband Omar Mateen killed 49 people and wounded dozens in an Orlando nightclub that was popular with gays was also charged with aiding and abetting by providing material support the officials said . She was taken into custody by F. B. I. agents at her home outside San Francisco where she had been living with her young son . Prosecutors had been weighing charges against her for months in the aftermath of the attack by her husband on June 122016 . Investigators interviewed Ms. Salman for hours after the attack and came to believe she was not telling the truth about her husband ’s plans to carry out the rampage . A Justice Department spokesman said Ms. Salman would make her initial appearance on Tuesday morning in federal court in Oakland Calif. The Justice Department ’s decision to prosecute Ms. Salman 30 ends part of the mystery that has surrounded her since the first days after the attack when she became a central subject of the investigation into her husband . “ Noor Salman had no foreknowledge nor could she predict what Omar Mateen intended to do that tragic night ” said her lawyer Linda Moreno . “ Noor has told her story of abuse at his hands . We believe it is misguided and wrong to prosecute her and that it dishonors the memories of the victims to punish an innocent person . ” The aiding and abetting a terrorism charge suggests that prosecutors believe that Ms. Salman helped him in some way — either before or after the terrorist attack . The decision to charge her is not without risks for prosecutors . If the case goes to trial prosecutors will have to contend with a jury that could be sympathetic to Ms. Salman who said she was in an abusive relationship and living in fear . In an interview last year with The New York Times Ms. Salman said she was “ unaware of everything ” in connection with the attack . Ms. Salman said she had accompanied her husband to Orlando with their child once when he scouted the club but did not know the purpose of the trip . On the day her husband drove to Orlando
" For Norwegians the sight of dozens of American Marines traipsing through the snow in military fatigues — the first time foreign forces have been posted to their country ’s territory since World War II — may have brought a welcomed sense of security but it also harked back to a dark era of the Cold War that many had hoped to forget . A United States military plane on Monday delivered most of the 330 Marines to a garrison in Vaernes in central Norway a deployment that Norwegian officials said had been carried out by the United States as part of a bilateral agreement . It was the latest effort by the United States and its European allies to buttress their defenses against a resurgent Russia which condemned the move . Despite being generally welcomed across the political spectrum the arrival of the Marines from Camp Lejeune N. C. — shown on Norwegian television dragging their suitcases through the snow — also provoked some jitters in Norway . A wealthy country that is a member of NATO but not the European Union the Nordic state has long prided itself on its independence . But the deployment recalled a Cold War era in which Russian intrigue grabbed headlines and Norwegians lived in fear of Soviet hegemony . Neuroses about Russia continue to exert influence in Norwegian popular culture . The political television thriller “ Okkupert ” depicts a future in which Norway is occupied by Russia and with the backing of the European Union takes over the country ’s oil production . Such fears have been magnified in recent years with murky sightings of submarines across the region that have stoked concern about Russian espionage and military intervention . In October 2014 an unidentified vessel spotted off the Stockholm archipelago spurred Sweden ’s largest mobilization since the Cold War and accusations that Russia was spying on the country . The episode called “ The Hunt for Reds in October ” in the Swedish news media included unsubstantiated reports of a man in black spotted wading near the vessel . It deeply unsettled the nation even as the Kremlin issued strenuous denials and accused Stockholm of scaremongering . Then in April 2015 the sudden appearance of an underwater vessel in Finland which shares a long border with Russia prompted the navy to fire depth charges — the first such warning in more than 10 years . And Lithuania on Monday said it plans to use European Union funding to build a fence on the border with Russia ’s highly militarised Kaliningrad exclave to increase security and prevent smuggling according to Agence . Construction of the $ 32 million fence will start this spring and will be finished by the end of the year said Interior Minister Eimutis Misiunas . “ The reasons are both economic to prevent smuggling and geopolitical to strengthen the E. U. ’s external border
" MEXICO CITY — Five people were killed early Monday at a crowded nightclub in the popular Caribbean tourist destination of Playa del Carmen Mexico when an armed man who had been denied entry opened fire inside the club prompting a gun battle and a stampede officials said . Four of the victims including three members of the security team that had blocked the gunman ’s entry were hit by bullets and the fifth victim was trampled in the resulting pandemonium the authorities said . The shooting occurred at the Blue Parrot nightclub which was hosting the final night of the BPM Festival an international electronic music event that draws fans from around the world . The gunman entered the club around 2:30 a. m. but was turned away at the door because he was carrying a weapon said Miguel Ángel Pech the state attorney for Quintana Roo State on the Yucatán Peninsula . The man then opened fire and as patrons threw themselves to the ground or rushed for the exits security guards at the club “ repelled ” the attacker Mr. Pech said adding that the guards were apparently armed . The victims included two Canadians a Colombian an Italian and a Mexican and at least 15 other people were injured
" TEARS WE CANNOT STOPA Sermon to White AmericaBy Michael Eric Dyson228 pp. St. Martin ’s Press . $ 24 . 99 . One Sunday in 1984 my father did something unexpected at least for a white man in Georgia . He drove us past the little rural church we usually attended and kept going 40 miles south all the way to Atlanta ’s Ebenezer Baptist — home parish of the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr . and an epicenter of the American civil rights movement . Reading Michael Eric Dyson ’s “ Tears We Cannot Stop : A Sermon to White America ” I was often reminded of that morning when I was first exposed to the righteous anger wry humor and unflinching honesty of a black pastor determined to guide and teach his flock . While Dyson is best known as a writer and sociologist he is also an ordained Baptist minister and his new book draws both its impassioned style and its moral urgency from his years in the pulpit . At a time when one video after another has forced us to acknowledge that unarmed are regularly killed by the police Dyson desperately wants his readers to confront the sources of that violence in our nation ’s longstanding culture of white supremacy . But he also knows how many political arguments and sociological studies have fallen on deaf ears . And so rather than a treatise “ Tears We Cannot Stop ” is a fiery sermon and an unabashedly emotional personal appeal . “ What I need to say ” to white America Dyson writes can only be said in “ a plea a cry a sermon from my heart to yours . ” The result is one of the most frank and searing discussions of race I have ever read . This is a book that will anger some readers especially those who reject Dyson ’s central premise : that if we want true racial equality in America whites themselves must destroy the enduring myths of white supremacy . Even sympathetic readers might mistake this extraordinary work for merely a catalog of white sins . But such a reading fails to account for the actual experience of Dyson ’s sermon
" British scientists have tied the tightest knot ever tied and as unlikely as it may seem this is important . Knots are useful in everyday life and specific kinds of knots are suitable for specific tasks — bowlines cleats hitches and nooses all hold things together in different ways . The same is true on the molecular level where braided or knotted strings of atoms and molecules can be put together in different patterns with varying characteristics . Until now scientists have been able to create only simple molecular knots with three or five crossings of strands . Now researchers in a study published in Science have described a way to tie a much more complicated and therefore much stronger knot . Everyone knows for example that Kevlar is very strong — impenetrable even to a bullet . But why ? Its molecules connect to form long chains that run parallel to each other . Together these molecules form an extremely strong yet flexible material . But the structure of Kevlar is relatively simple : identical molecules packed tightly next to each other like pencils in a pencil box . Knotted or woven strands of molecules on the other hand can potentially create an even more flexible lighter and stronger material — a tightly knit sweater on the molecular level . To create their stronger knot a team of researchers mixed oxygen nitrogen and carbon in a solution with metal ions . The organic molecules wrap themselves around sticky iron ions and chloride ions crossing in just the right ways and at just the right points . The loose ends were then sealed together chemically forming a completely tied knot with eight crossings . The number of crossings made the knot much tighter than anything that had ever been achieved before at the molecular level . The entire loop is tiny the length of 192 atoms . David A. Leigh
" WASHINGTON — President Obama on Tuesday commuted all but four months of the remaining prison sentence of Chelsea Manning the Army intelligence analyst convicted of a 2010 leak that revealed American military and diplomatic activities across the world disrupted Mr. Obama ’s administration and brought global prominence to WikiLeaks the recipient of those disclosures . The decision by Mr. Obama rescued Ms. Manning who twice tried to kill herself last year from an uncertain future as a transgender woman incarcerated at the men ’s military prison at Fort Leavenworth Kan . She has been jailed for nearly seven years and her sentence was by far the longest punishment ever imposed in the United States for a leak conviction . At the same time that Mr. Obama commuted the sentence of Ms. Manning a enlisted soldier at the time of her leaks he also pardoned James E. Cartwright the retired Marine general and former vice chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff who pleaded guilty to lying about his conversations with reporters to F. B. I. agents investigating a leak of classified information about cyberattacks on Iran ’s nuclear program . The two acts of clemency were a remarkable final step for a president whose administration carried out an unprecedented criminal crackdown on leaks of government secrets . Depending on how they are counted the Obama administration has prosecuted either nine or 10 such cases more than were charged under all previous presidencies combined . In addition Mr. Obama on Tuesday commuted the sentence of Oscar Lopez Rivera who was part of a Puerto Rican nationalist group that carried out a string of bombings in the late 1970 s and early 1980 s the other members of that group had long since been freed . Mr. Obama also granted 63 other pardons and 207 other commutations mostly for drug offenders . Under the terms of the commutation announced by the White House on Tuesday Ms. Manning is set to be freed on May 17 of this year rather than in 2045 . A senior administration official said the delay was part of a standard transition period for commutations to time served and was designed to allow for such steps as finding a place for Ms. Manning to live after her release . The commutation also relieved the Defense Department of the difficult responsibility of Ms. Manning ’s incarceration as she pushes for treatment for her gender dysphoria including sex reassignment surgery that the military has no experience providing . But the move was sharply criticized by several prominent Republicans including the chairmen of the House and Senate armed services committees
" Most mornings at 4:30 half an hour before the “ first call ” awakens inmates at the Fort Leavenworth military prison in Kansas an alarm rings within an cell . Inmate 89289 slightly built with short hair rises to apply makeup and don female undergarments and a brown uniform before the men in the adjacent cells stir . That is the routine for Chelsea Manning America ’s most famous convicted leaker and the prison ’s most unusual inmate . She is serving the longest sentence ever imposed for disclosing government secrets — 35 years — and her status as a celebrity of sorts and an incarcerated transgender woman presents continuing difficulties for the military . During the day Ms. Manning who was an Army intelligence analyst known as Bradley Manning when she disclosed archives of secret military and diplomatic files to WikiLeaks in 2010 builds picture frames and furniture in the prison wood shop . In the evenings before the 10:05 p. m. lockdown she reads through streams of letters including from antisecrecy enthusiasts who view her as a . “ I am always busy . I have a backlog of things to do : legal administrative press inquiries and writing — lots of writing ” Ms. Manning wrote in response to questions submitted by The Times because the Army does not permit her to speak directly to journalists . “ Being me is a job . ” But Ms. Manning who is struggling to transition to life as a woman while enduring a bleak existence at a male military prison has asked President Obama to commute the remainder of her sentence before he leaves office next week . She poses particular challenges as a prisoner with a volunteer support network that helps bring global attention to her treatment fragile mental state — she twice tried to commit suicide in 2016 — and need for treatment that the military has no experience providing . Her request comes as the world is again focused on WikiLeaks and its founder Julian Assange
" President Obama on Tuesday commuted the sentence of a man convicted for his role in a Puerto Rican nationalist group linked to more than 100 bombings in New York and other cities in the 1970 s and 1980 s . The man Oscar Lopez Rivera was serving a sentence after being convicted of numerous charges including seditious conspiracy a charge used for those plotting to overthrow the United States government . He was linked to the radical group known as the F. A. L. N. the Spanish acronym for the Armed Forces of National Liberation and was one of more than a dozen group members convicted in the 1980 s . Under Mr. Obama ’s commutation order Mr. Lopez Rivera ’s prison sentence will expire May 17 . It was one of 209 grants of commutation by the president announced Tuesday . The F. A. L. N. which waged a violent campaign for the independence of Puerto Rico was considered by the authorities to be among the most elusive and resilient terrorist groups to operate in the United States . Among its notable attacks was a bombing at Fraunces Tavern in New York in 1975 that killed four people . The group was known for its membership fanatical zeal and tactics as exemplified by the bombings of four government buildings in Manhattan and Brooklyn on New Year ’s Eve in 1982 that seriously wounded three police officers . Mr. Lopez Rivera was not specifically charged in the Fraunces Tavern bombing but more broadly with among other things the interstate transportation of firearms with the intent to commit violent crimes and transportation of explosives with intent to kill and injure people and to destroy government buildings and property . President Bill Clinton offered Mr. Lopez Rivera and other members of the F. A. L. N. clemency in 1999 a decision that stirred an emotional debate . Mr. Clinton said their sentences were out of proportion with their offenses . While 12 prisoners accepted the offer and were freed Mr. Lopez Rivera rejected the chance to reduce his sentence because it did not include all of the group ’s members his lawyer Jan Susler said at the time . If he had accepted the agreement she said he would have been eligible for release in 2009 . A senior Obama administration official said on Tuesday that Mr. Lopez Rivera 74
" WASHINGTON — In one way at least Donald J. Trump has already surpassed all of his recent predecessors . It took Barack Obama 18 months in the White House for his approval rating to slip to 44 percent in Gallup polling and it took George W. Bush 4½ years to fall that far . Mr. Trump got there before even being sworn in . Indeed Mr. Trump will take office on Friday with less popular support than any new president in modern times according to an array of surveys a sign that he has failed to rally Americans behind him beyond the base that helped him win in November . Rather than a unifying moment his transition to power has seen a continuation of the polarization of the election last year . Where other presidents used the weeks before their inauguration to put the animosities of the campaign behind them and to try to knit the country together again Mr. Trump has approached the interregnum as if he were a television wrestling star . He has taken on a civil rights icon a Hollywood actress intelligence agencies defense contractors European leaders and President Obama . The healing theme common at this stage in the presidential cycle is absent . “ He seems to want to engage with every windmill that he can find rather than focus on the large aspect of assuming the most important position on earth ” Senator John McCain Republican of Arizona said on CNN on Tuesday . “ And obviously apparently according to the polls many Americans are not happy with that approach when he has not even assumed the presidency . ” Two polls out on Tuesday — one by CNN and ORC and another by The Washington Post and ABC News — found that just 40 percent of Americans approved of Mr. Trump ’s performance heading into the inauguration on Friday . NBC News and The Wall Street Journal put his approval rating at 44 percent calling it the lowest rating ever for an incoming president . By comparison
" WASHINGTON — Donald J. Trump and congressional Republicans appear to have accomplished a feat that President Obama with all the power at his disposal could not in the past seven years : They have galvanized outspoken support for the Affordable Care Act . People who benefit from the law are flooding Congress with testimonials . Angry consumers are confronting Republican lawmakers . And Democrats who saw the law as a political liability in recent elections have suddenly found their voice proudly defending the law now that it is in trouble . Thousands of people across the country held rallies over the weekend to save the health care law which Republicans moved last week to repeal with a first but crucial legislative step . A widely circulated video showed Representative Mike Coffman Republican of Colorado eluding constituents who had wanted to meet with him to express their concerns on Saturday at a community event in Aurora Colo . Rallies on Sunday to save the health law drew robust crowds around the country . “ We are here today — thousands strong in Boston and at more rallies all across this country — because we will make our voices heard ” Senator Elizabeth Warren Democrat of Massachusetts told a crowd outside Faneuil Hall in Boston . “ If Republicans try to rip health care out of the hands of millions of Americans we will fight them every step of the way . ” And progressive groups are planning a bus tour to fight the repeal effort starting Tuesday . With their quick strike on the law in the first days of the new Congress Republicans had hoped to begin the repeal process before a backlash could develop or opposition could be organized . But congressional Republicans are at risk of losing the message war especially since they are fighting on two fronts . On one side the has repeatedly lobbed disruptive demands at them such as his insistence that they prepare a replacement health bill almost immediately . To that he added a new promise over the weekend : that the Republican version would provide “ insurance for everybody . ” On the other front Democratic lawmakers have taken to quoting grateful constituents to personalize what can be an arcane legislative fight : Bryce in Seattle Randy in Rhinelander Wis . Nicole in Hockessin
" Joe Biden ’s personal compartment on the modified Boeing 757 that serves as Air Force Two had the feel of a motel manager ’s office equipped with communications gear . The room held a little black couch with a pullout bed he had slept on more times than he could count over the last eight years during which he logged more than a million miles aloft . We were en route back to Wilmington Del . from Cartagena Colombia in early December and Biden was sitting in a black leather seat with a binder in his lap . It contained the speech he had given at the Democratic National Convention in July . He told me he had been rereading it . He began reciting aloud : “ If you live in neighborhoods like the one Jill and I grew up in if you worry about your job and getting decent pay . . .. ” His voice accelerated . “ If you worry about your children ’s education if you ’re taking care of an elderly parent there ’s only one person in this race who . . .. ” He looked up at me and sighed . “ I wish to hell I ’d just kept saying the exact same thing . ” Biden was afflicted with regret . He was sorry that on the campaign trail he had spoken so often about Donald Trump ’s unfitness for office and not enough about what Hillary Clinton would do for the middle class . He was sorry he didn ’t push harder inside the White House for a tax cut . And he was still torn over his decision not to run for president a race that he said would have been “ brutal ” but that he also believed he could have won . I spoke with Biden intermittently in the months before and after Election Day and I had no doubt as to why he didn ’t jump in . He was still corny gabby lovable Uncle Joe the guy who once said : “ Stand up Chuck ! Let ’em see you ! ” to a man in a wheelchair . But nearly every speech and interview now included some moving mention of his son Beau who died of brain cancer in 2015 and how much Biden was doing and intended to continue to do for the rest of his life to speed the search for cancer cures . I saw Biden cry in Manchester
" Not since Lincoln has there been a president as fundamentally shaped — in his life convictions and outlook on the world — by reading and writing as Barack Obama . Last Friday seven days before his departure from the White House Mr. Obama sat down in the Oval Office and talked about the indispensable role that books have played during his presidency and throughout his life — from his peripatetic and sometimes lonely boyhood when “ these worlds that were portable ” provided companionship to his youth when they helped him to figure out who he was what he thought and what was important . During his eight years in the White House — in a noisy era of information overload extreme partisanship and reactions — books were a sustaining source of ideas and inspiration and gave him a renewed appreciation for the complexities and ambiguities of the human condition . “ At a time when events move so quickly and so much information is transmitted ” he said reading gave him the ability to occasionally “ slow down and get perspective ” and “ the ability to get in somebody else ’s shoes . ” These two things he added “ have been invaluable to me . Whether they ’ve made me a better president I can ’t say . But what I can say is that they have allowed me to sort of maintain my balance during the course of eight years because this is a place that comes at you hard and fast and doesn ’t let up . ” [ Read a transcript of the interview with Barack Obama ] The writings of Lincoln the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr . Gandhi and Nelson Mandela Mr. Obama found were “ particularly helpful ” when “ what you wanted was a sense of solidarity ” adding “ during very difficult moments this job can be very isolating . ” “ So sometimes you have to sort of hop across history to find folks who have been similarly feeling isolated and that ’s been useful . ” There is a handwritten copy of the Gettysburg Address in the Lincoln Bedroom and sometimes
" In the waning days of his presidency Barack Obama is waging a final battle — not over legislation or a Supreme Court seat but over how he will be remembered . In the latest episode of The we explore what exactly the Obama legacy will be . The president is aggressively telling his version through a major speech broadcast on TV interviews and a forthcoming book . But Donald J. Trump is telling a very different version through tweets speeches and news conferences . Who ’s will win out ? I speak with David Leonhardt an columnist at The New York Times who chronicled the Obama administration from the start and Jodi Kantor a reporter whose book “ The Obamas ” was just reissued with a new preface . Our conversation explores Mr. Obama ’s impact on race health care economic inequality and America ’s place in the world . And we seek to answer a question historians may puzzle over for decades : Just how consequential was this presidency compared with past White Houses ? I speak as well to former Representative Barney Frank of Massachusetts about whether Mr. Obama ’s relationship with Republican lawmakers had to be so adversarial polarizing and partisan . Who was to blame ? Could Mr. Obama have done more to get things done using executive orders ? Mr. Frank is blunt . “ Absolutely not ” he says . “ You had a Republican majority in both houses that ( A ) was determined to undercut him politically and ( B ) did not care if the government was dysfunctional because they don ’t like government anyway . And to the extent by the way that a failure for the government to perform discredited government that was a further benefit as far as they ’re concerned . ” From a desktop or laptop
" WASHINGTON — At her confirmation hearing on Tuesday to be education secretary Betsy DeVos vigorously defended her work steering taxpayer dollars from traditional public schools arguing that it was time to move away from a “ one size fits all ” system and toward newer models for students from preschool to college . The hearing quickly became a heated and partisan debate that reflected the nation ’s political divide on how best to spend public money in education . Republicans applauded Ms. DeVos ’s work to expand charter schools and school vouchers which give families public funds to help pay tuition at private schools . Democrats criticized her for wanting to “ privatize ” public education and pushed her unsuccessfully to support making public colleges and universities . Ms. DeVos a billionaire with a complex web of investments including in companies that stand to win or lose from federal education policy was the first nominee of Donald J. Trump to have a Senate hearing without completing an ethics review on how she planned to avoid conflicts of interest . Democrats pointed out that in the past Republicans had insisted that no hearings be conducted before those reviews were complete . Senator Lamar Alexander Republican of Tennessee and chairman of the Committee on Health Education Labor and Pensions limited the questioning to one round of five minutes for each senator prompting howls from Democrats who noted that previous hearings had included two rounds of questions . “ It suggests that this committee is trying to protect this nominee from scrutiny ” said Senator Christopher S. Murphy Democrat of Connecticut . With time limited Democrats confronted Ms. DeVos with questions demanding that she explain her family ’s contributions to groups that support conversion therapy for gay people her donations to Republicans and their causes which she agreed totaled about $ 200 million over the years her past statements that government “ sucks ” and that public schools are a “ dead end ” and the poor performance of charter schools in Detroit
" On Wednesday the Senate Environment and Public Works Committee will consider Donald J. Trump ’s choice of Scott Pruitt Oklahoma ’s attorney general since 2011 to lead the Environmental Protection Agency . Mr. Pruitt spent much of his time in office fighting the Obama administration over the E. P. A. ’s actions to regulate air and water pollution and to curb greenhouse gas emissions . The committee is led by Senator John Barrasso Republican of Wyoming an outspoken contrarian on climate change and includes several Republicans openly hostile to federal action to address it . The Democratic members of the committee include some of the Senate ’s strongest supporters of the E. P. A. and most forceful voices for decisive action on climate change . We asked readers what questions they would ask if they could question Mr. Pruitt . More than 2000 replied and their answers largely fell into a few categories . Here is what some of them would like to know . Many readers seemed familiar with Mr. Pruitt ’s statement that the science of climate change is “ far from settled . ” Most pointed out that an overwhelming majority of climate scientists agree that climate change is happening and is caused by human activity specifically by the emissions of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases and asked for Mr. Pruitt ’s sources for his position . Seth Rudman 28 a scientific researcher at the University of Pennsylvania in Philadelphia asked “ Can you describe the shortcomings of the scientific evidence for climate change and the type of data that would be needed to convince you that climate change is happening ? ” While being a scientist is not a requirement for the job readers worried about what having a climate denialist at the top might mean for the agency . “ During the Bush administration climate scientists including Dr. James Hansen claimed that their voices were suppressed and their reports changed to minimize the role of humans in accelerating climate change and its impact ” wrote Donald Chartier
1.0"WASHINGTON — Representative Ryan Zinke Republican of Montana pitched himself on Tuesday as a serious steward of federal resources in his confirmation hearing for interior secretary frequently bucking conservative orthodoxy on ownership of public lands federal funding for preservation and even briefly climate change . But Mr. Zinke also emphasized his support for drilling mining and logging on federal lands activities strongly opposed by many environmental groups . In testimony before a Senate panel that lasted nearly four hours Mr. Zinke a former member of the Navy SEALs who just finished his first term in the House tried to balance the importance of preservation with use of the nation ’s public lands and waters . He expressed admiration for Gifford Pinchot the first United States Forest Service chief who advocated planned use and renewal . Mr. Zinke also said he supported energy development on federal lands . Recreational activities and mining for instance are not mutually exclusive he said . “ It doesn ’t have to be in conflict ” he said . Mr. Zinke broke with Donald J. Trump and even his own past statements on climate change disagreeing with Mr. Trump ’s assertion at one point that it is “ a hoax . ” Having once said that climate change was “ not proven science
" A former contestant on “ The Apprentice ” who accused Donald J. Trump of sexual assault during the presidential race filed a lawsuit against him on Tuesday alleging that Mr. Trump defamed her when he claimed that she fabricated the assault . Summer Zervos and her lawyer Gloria Allred announced the lawsuit at a news conference in Los Angeles days before Mr. Trump is set to enter the White House . During the campaign more than 10 women accused Mr. Trump of inappropriate sexual contact . Mr. Trump denied every allegation . When Ms. Zervos made her claim in October saying that Mr. Trump had kissed and groped her without her consent during encounters at his office in New York and at a hotel in Los Angeles Mr. Trump said he never met her “ at a hotel or greeted her inappropriately ” and accused Ms. Zervos and other women of lying according to the lawsuit which was filed in New York State Supreme Court . “ But it was Donald Trump who was lying when he falsely denied his predatory misconduct with Summer Zervos and derided her for perpetrating a ‘ hoax ’ and making up a ‘ phony ’ story to get attention ” the lawsuit says . “ Donald Trump lied again and again and again and again . In doing so he used his national and international bully pulpit to make false factual statements to denigrate and verbally attack Ms. Zervos and the other women . ” It went on to say that “ Mr. Trump knew that his false disparaging statements would be heard and read by people around the world and that these women including Summer Zervos would be subjected to threats of violence economic harm
1.0"The American Museum of Natural History has long been on the front lines of the climate change discussion as its scientists study the potential damage and its educators try to alert new generations to the dangers of global warming . The depth of that mission is evident in the numerous exhibitions at this Manhattan museum like the film “ Wonders of the Arctic ” which is on view through March 2. “ The polar bear has always been the symbol of the Arctic ” the narrator intones . “ Now it ’s become the face of climate change and the threat it poses . ” But one of the museum ’s leaders a trustee who is also an important donor to the institution Rebekah Mercer has been using her family ’s millions to fund organizations that question climate change a cornerstone of the conservative agenda she is advancing as an influential member of Donald J. Trump ’s transition team . In recent years the Mercer Family Foundation — which Ms. Mercer operates with her father the New York investor Robert Mercer — has given nearly $ 8 million to organizations including the Heartland Institute in Illinois a group that rejects the scientific consensus on climate change . She is also on the board of the Heritage Foundation a conservative think tank that is skeptical of whether human behavior causes climate change . The connection of Ms. Mercer the museum and the Mercer Family Foundation ’s donation history came to light during an analysis by The New York Times of activities by cultural leaders who donated to Mr. Trump ’s presidential campaign . Several of them are board members at New York City arts organizations including John Paulson at the Metropolitan Museum of Art and Mercedes T. Bass at the Metropolitan Opera . But none are as unusual a fit as Ms. Mercer and the American Museum of Natural History . On one level she is the sort of trustee museums and other nonprofit arts groups compete for : a donor whose board membership could lead to more contributions . Museums regularly ask major donors to become trustees — particularly those as generous as Ms. Mercer whose foundation has donated at least $ 3 million to the museum over the past few years . Museum leaders generally do not vet donors and trustees for their personal or political views or apply ideological litmus tests . But more often than not trustees champion the missions and philosophical underpinnings of their museums . Since Ms. Mercer has only recently emerged as a player in the Republican Party bringing her charitable giving new public attention it ’s likely that the museum ’s trustees were unaware of her philanthropic history — and specifically
" WASHINGTON — In the Virginia suburb of McLean where the local diner is a C. I. A. breakfast hangout Gen. Michael V. Hayden who ran the agency for George W. Bush is playing career counselor these days . With Donald J. Trump attacking the intelligence community the general says his “ old tribe ’ ’ is feeling “ a special angst . ” In Takoma Park Md . a “ zone ” since 1983 a resistance movement is taking shape . Nadine Bloch an activist and artist is running training on nonviolent protest — complete with mock police officers wielding rolled up newspapers as batons . And here in the District of Columbia where 91 percent of voters cast their ballots for Hillary Clinton “ panic ” is setting in said John Feehery a Republican strategist and Trump enthusiast . Leslie Harris a liberal Democratic lawyer uses war imagery : “ I feel like my city is about to be invaded . ” Washington has always been a chameleon of a city accustomed to remaking itself when the White House changes hands . But as Mr. Trump ’s inaugural draws near in a nation so deeply divided that it seems the political middle has entirely disappeared perhaps no place in America feels as unsteady and on edge as the capital which Mr. Trump calls “ the swamp . ” With his 6 a. m. Twitter blasts and style — and a roster of conservative Cabinet picks eager to do an on President Obama ’s policies — Mr. Trump has upended the city ’s rhythms and jangled its nerves . The White House press corps is fighting to keep its work space in the West Wing . lobbyists worry their clients will turn up in his Twitter feed . Civil servants many of them working class
" Donald J. Trump won ’t be sworn in until Friday but big business has already thrown him a veritable inaugural ball . A series of companies among them Ford Lockheed Martin Amazon and Sprint have all announced plans in recent weeks to hire and invest in the United States . A who ’s who of executives from boardrooms here and overseas have made the pilgrimage to Trump Tower and sought the ’s blessing . The drumbeat of announcements — on Tuesday it was the turn of General Motors and Walmart — is not just about winning good headlines or a favorable mention from the tweeter in chief however . While the jobs and investments are real enough all of these corporate behemoths will soon have business before the new administration with moves expected on mergers trade policy tax reform defense contracts and regulation . Signaling to the and his team that they are on board now also provides chief executives with more leverage down the line . “ It might be an attempt to buy good will but I don ’t blame them for trying to do that ” said Tom C. Korologos a longtime Republican strategist and an adviser at the law firm DLA Piper in Washington . “ It ’s a new administration and companies are nervous and don ’t know what to expect . ” Ultimately the new administration ’s decisions will be formulated far from the limelight in conference rooms at federal agencies in Washington or behind closed doors on Capitol Hill . The money riding on the outcome runs into the trillions . And on issues the companies will need to make a strong case . Detroit automakers for example are concerned that Washington will impose tariffs on cars made in Mexico but they are eager for wiggle room on new standards at home . Walmart is worried about rising trade tensions with China
" LONDON — “ Get on with it . ” With those words late in a major speech on Tuesday Prime Minister Theresa May charted Britain ’s course toward a clean break with the European Union and expressed her fondest hope : that the time for “ division and discord ” is over . Her speech outlined what promised to be a hugely complex negotiation and it defined the broad objectives but not the details of British withdrawal . “ The United Kingdom is leaving the European Union and my job is to get the right deal for Britain as we do ” she said . With the address Mrs. May began the jockeying that will lead to a break after more than four decades of tight integration and define Britain ’s relations with its neighbors for decades to come . She confirmed that Britain is determined to regain control of migration from the European Union and rejected the supremacy of the European Court of Justice . That stance is anathema to the European Union which has made the free movement of people — as well as goods capital and services — a bedrock principle and which relies on the court to arbitrate . “ Let me be clear ” Mrs. May said acknowledging the differences . “ What I am proposing cannot mean remaining in the single market . ” She said that she hoped to complete a final deal with the European Union by March 2019 and that it would be voted on by both houses of Parliament . She was not clear about what would happen if Parliament rejected the deal though some speculated that a rejection would result in the sort of chaotic “ cliff edge ” breakup that she and Britain ’s bankers and business leaders hoped to avoid . Mrs. May struck a diplomatic note including an appeal for a new partnership with Continental Europe but not at all costs . “ We seek a new and equal partnership — between an independent global Britain and our friends and allies in the E.

" SOFIA Bulgaria — With Bulgaria in the grips of a bank run in the summer of 2014 Lyubomir Vassilev was panicking . Unemployed and living off a compensation package from a workplace accident he had lost access to his bank account and joined others in street protests when a troubled lender went into bankruptcy setting off a financial — and political — crisis . Months later with his parents having had to borrow money from relatives to help him survive Mr. Vassilev finally got his $ 6 000 back . “ After the bank went bankrupt ” he said “ I lost trust in the banking system . ” Mr. Vassilev blamed Bulgaria ’s leaders and like many of his compatriots attributed the resolution of the crisis to the European Union . Across much of Western Europe critics complain of distant and unfeeling technocrats in Brussels who enforce arcane rules to the letter with little understanding of local nuances and needs . Britain ’s vote in June to leave the bloc struck a stinging blow against regional unity at a time when confidence was already flagging in the European Union . But Mr. Vassilev and his fellow citizens paint a different picture — one of regional officials who hold domestic authorities to account set higher standards and are more trustworthy than their local counterparts . Bulgaria joined the European Union in 2007 along with Romania . At the time polling indicated that a slim majority of its population was in favor of membership hopeful that it would strengthen the Balkan country ’s economy and political institutions . In the years since Bulgaria has remained the bloc ’s poorest member state with a per capita gross domestic product about half the regional average . Still
" DAVOS Switzerland — In a world troubled by grave uncertainties over the basics governing trade security and the mission to limit climate change President Xi Jinping of China on Tuesday portrayed his nation as a responsible global citizen dedicated to furthering international integration . That a leader of the People ’s Republic of China can stake a claim to the mantle of leadership in the realm of free trade speaks to the unforeseen even surreal alteration of the global order in recent months . His message delivered here in the Swiss Alps at the annual gathering of the World Economic Forum appeared meticulously timed to the tumultuous moment at hand . He was speaking three days before Donald J. Trump was to be inaugurated president of the United States raising the prospect of a trade war with China and on the same day that Prime Minister Theresa May of Britain outlined plans to pursue her country ’s departure from the European Union . The Chinese leader used his moment to make an expansive case for globalization as a source of prosperity . He never mentioned Mr. Trump by name nor did he even make reference to the fact that the White House is about to gain a new occupant . Yet his speech resonated as a rebuke of the trajectory that the has promised — not least his repeated threat of steep tariffs on Chinese goods as a response to what he portrays as predatory trade practices . In myriad ways Mr. Xi is a strikingly steward of openness and connectivity . Under his direction China ’s Communist Party has clamped down severely on civil society tightening restrictions on the internet and jailing scores of lawyers focused on using the country ’s own laws to defend the rights of aggrieved people . He has projected China ’s navy into contested waters in the South China and East China Seas . Throughout his speech Mr. Xi carefully used the phrase “ economic globalization ” while avoiding unqualified “ globalization ” reflecting China ’s spurning of an open internet universal human rights and free elections . Indeed the metaphor he used to reject protectionism — “ like locking oneself in a dark room ” — could just as well have been used to describe China ’s political path under his leadership with the Communist Party overtly guiding a campaign to restrict the influence of what it labels Western notions such as democracy .

" With just days to go before the inauguration of Donald J. Trump as president once ebullient markets have eased a bit as investors have begun to ponder more seriously the risks of a Trump administration . After a in the weeks after Mr. Trump ’s election victory stock markets in the United States have been little changed in the last month — with investors on several occasions stepping back as opposed to elevating the Dow Jones industrial average past a 20000 milestone . The concerns include a dollar that has gained too much in value worries about trade wars with China and Mexico and most broadly a fear that Mr. Trump will not be able to deliver on his promises to cut taxes increase government spending and reduce regulation . The market declines in recent weeks have been very modest and investors for now seem to be prepared to give Mr. Trump the benefit of the doubt on his plans for the economy . Nevertheless in the wake of his unpredictable Twitter posts last week ’s news conference and Mr. Trump ’s tough talk about China a mood of caution has tempered earlier bouts of euphoria . Mr. Trump ’s comments over the weekend about the dollar being too strong about the possibility that more countries will follow Britain out of the European Union and his intention to tax German carmakers for not building factories in the United States all heightened these concerns . “ People are concerned about an appreciating dollar how much higher rates will go and antagonizing China ” Laurence D. Fink the chief executive of the asset management giant BlackRock said in an interview last week . “ There has been too much conversation about the glories of the U. S. stock market . ” On Tuesday the dollar ’s main index
" OAKLAND Calif. — She fired none of the shots she was nowhere near the bloody scene and none of the evidence made public so far hints that she shared her husband ’s violent jihadist ideology . Yet Noor Zahi Salman the widow of the gunman who massacred revelers at an Orlando nightclub stood before a federal judge on Tuesday as the only person charged in the attack . In the early hours of June 12 Ms. Salman ’s husband Omar Mateen killed 49 people at Pulse a gay nightclub and wounded 53 others in one of the worst terrorist attacks on American soil . Before being fatally shot by the police Mr. Mateen a security guard declared his allegiance to the Islamic State . Though suspicion and scrutiny naturally fall on people close to someone who commits terrorism or mass murder it is rare for a wife or a girlfriend to end up facing charges . But in a brief hearing in federal court in Oakland a federal prosecutor Roger Handberg explained why the authorities considered Ms. Salman an exception . “ She knew he was going to conduct the attack ” Mr. Handberg said . An indictment unsealed on Tuesday accused Ms. Salman 30
" HONG KONG — Almost three years after Malaysia Airlines Flight 370 disappeared with 239 people on board officials said on Tuesday that they had called off the underwater search for the plane ensuring that one of the great aviation mysteries will remain unsolved for the foreseeable future . The decision which had been expected indefinitely suspends an intensive search in the southern Indian Ocean for remnants of the plane a Boeing 777 . The underwater search turned up no traces of the aircraft although pieces of debris were found as far away as Tanzania . Flight 370 disappeared on the way from Kuala Lumpur the Malaysian capital to Beijing on March 82014 prompting the largest and costliest search in aviation history . Investigators determined that the plane veered off course and flew south for several hours for reasons that remain unknown . “ Today the last search vessel has left the underwater search area ” the governments of Australia China and Malaysia the three countries that oversaw the search said in a joint statement on Tuesday . “ Malaysia Airlines Flight 370 has not been located in the underwater search area in the southern Indian Ocean ” a zone of more than 46000 square miles . “ Despite every effort using the best science available technology as well as modeling and advice from highly skilled professionals who are the best in their field unfortunately
" The New York Times has deftly adapted to the demands of digital journalism but it needs to change even more quickly according to an internal report that recommends the company expand training for reporters and editors hire journalists with more varied skills and deepen engagement with readers as a way to build loyalty and attract the subscriptions necessary to survive . The report released to The Times newsroom on Tuesday culminates a year of work by a group of seven journalists who were asked by Dean Baquet the executive editor to conduct a review of the newsroom and determine a blueprint for its path forward . Titled “ Journalism That Stands Apart ” and known internally as the 2020 report the document provides a set of broad principles to accelerate the transformation while maintaining a commitment to journalism . The report comes at a particularly sobering time for the legacy media industry . The steep and continuous decline of print advertising has led to significant financial challenges for most newspapers which in turn are cutting costs and trying to find new revenue sources . News organizations including The Wall Street Journal and Gannett have made significant cuts in staffing The Journal is currently conducting a newsroom review similar to that of The Times called WSJ2020 . Among the other recommendations in The Times ’s report were reducing duplicative layers of article editing and having visual experts play “ the primary role covering some stories ” — part of an urgent call for more visual journalism . The report also calls for a renewed focus on diversity within The Times as a way of ensuring that the paper ’s journalists “ reflect the audience we seek . ” “ The world is changing really rapidly ” David Leonhardt a columnist who led the group ’s work said in an interview . “ We have to keep up and even get ahead of it . ” In a note to the newsroom Mr. Baquet and Joseph Kahn The Times ’s managing editor
1.0"KINSTON N. C. — Just before Christmas in the soup kitchen that serves this small town built on tobacco textiles and hogs the chef and cooking show star Vivian Howard finished stirring a pot of pork and sweet potato stew and turned to a local television reporter . How does it feel the reporter asked to know that she had saved her hometown ? “ If I had saved Kinston“ she replied “ we wouldn ’t need a food bank and all these people wouldn ’t be waiting for lunch . ” Ms. Howard 38 has been called many things . Her mother calls her the life of the party . Her father calls her Big Time a nickname from her childhood . A few of the 80 people she employs call her a control freak . But “ hometown hero ” may be the label that makes her most uncomfortable . “ Saving a town was not what I was trying to do ” she said . “ I ’m just a storyteller . A storyteller who cooks . ” Still Ms. Howard the girl who spent her childhood plotting an escape from this rural eastern North Carolina county has become an unlikely engine in its economic and cultural revival . Twelve years ago when her family talked her into coming home to open a restaurant she thought that somehow she had failed . Now
" PARIS — He has nailed his scrotum to the cobblestones of Red Square sewn his lips shut to protest restrictions and set fire to the doors of Russia ’s Federal Security Service . Now Pyotr Pavlensky Russia ’s performance artist has fled to France where he intends to seek political asylum . Russian authorities questioned Mr. Pavlensky and his partner Oksana Shalygina last month after an actress at an Moscow theater filed a complaint accusing them of sexual assault . The couple deny the allegations saying that the encounter was a consensual threesome and that the case is politically motivated . Amid the ambiguities — and at a time when violence against women is a topic of intense debate in the country — Russia ’s cultural opposition is now divided over a figure once seen as a symbol of the resistance to President Vladimir V. Putin ’s Russia . Mr. Pavlensky and Ms. Shalygina have not been formally charged but were questioned by the police in Moscow on Dec. 15 and informed that they could face up to 10 years in prison . Told not to leave Moscow while the case was pending they said they saw what was likely to happen and took their daughters ages 6 and 8 to France over the weekend after spending a month in Ukraine . “ We ’ve become victims of this investigation ” Mr. Pavlensky said in an interview on Monday in a Paris cafe speaking Russian through an interpreter and with Ms. Shalygina at his side . “ It ’s like a horrible dream that you can ’t even imagine . ” The situation — with its charges of a honey trap and “ kompromat ” ( compromising material gathered by the authorities ) — reflects the climate of suspicion and growing authoritarianism in Russia where artists like the female punk band Pussy Riot have faced jail but for the most part outright censorship has given way to artistic in the face of changing laws and cuts to culture funding . The accusations however
" To be a woman in the United States is to feel unequal despite great strides in gender equality according to a poll about gender in postelection America released Tuesday . It ’s catcalls on the street disrespect at work and unbalanced responsibilities at home . For girls it ’s being taught more than boys to aspire to marriage and for women it ’s watching positions of power go to men . Men however don ’t necessarily see it that way . Those are some of the findings from the poll by PerryUndem a nonpartisan research and polling firm whose biggest clients are foundations . It surveyed 1302 adults in December via the National Opinion Research Center at the University of Chicago ’s AmeriSpeak panel . percent of women said sexism was a problem in society today and 41 percent of women said they had felt unequal because of their gender . Men underestimated the sexism felt by the women in their lives the survey found . And while most respondents agreed it ’s a better time to be a man than a woman in our society only Republican men thought it was a better time to be a woman than a man . As women across the nation prepare to march in protest of an election in which gender loomed large the poll results reveal nearly unanimous support for gender equality and policies that would help women — but deep partisan divides in the perception of inequality and of who ’s thriving and who ’s losing in society . Many Americans seemed to think others had it better than they did especially Republican men . Over all only 37 percent of respondents thought it was a good time to be a woman in the United States . Fewer thought it was a good time to be a minority woman 24 percent said it was a good time to be a Latina and 11 percent a Muslim woman . Republican men seem to see it differently . Just over half thought it was a good time to be a woman
" This is just a guess but the programming that is all over television at the moment feels as if it might go largely unwatched . The offerings are generally some combination of retrospective and analysis . Do admirers of President Obama really want to revisit his slow slide from 2008 triumph to 2017 vilification ? Do fans of the Donald J. Trump want to do anything other than say “ Don ’t let the door hit you on the way out ” and then plunge into their new opportunity ? That said let ’s see if we can find any reason to watch two of this week ’s programs : four hours ’ worth of “ Frontline ” on PBS titled “ Divided States of America ” and a CNN production “ The End : Inside the Last Days of the Obama White House . ” The “ Frontline ” which is being broadcast in chunks on Tuesday and Wednesday nights is a rehashing of recent history that is for the most part all too familiar a drumbeat of events that led to a government and a country defined by polarization . Large stretches of it aren ’t particularly enlightening — who needs to relive the dreary predictably acrimonious battles over budget stalemates and health care or to hear sound bites of radio stars fanning the flames of racism and hate ? The structure of this trip down memory lane doesn ’t make it any more palatable . Michael Kirk who made the documentary is largely content to let the usual talking heads be the guides — journalists political operatives lawmakers or former lawmakers . Some of them are from the same chattering class that failed to grasp the rise of Mr. Trump in the first place . Hindsight wisdom of this sort seems especially out of place now . As for the ordinary Americans who put Mr. Trump in the White House we hear them mostly in clips that only reinforce the easy stereotypes about them . Despite those criticisms the program does manage to weave a convincing tapestry of discontent and not just from the obvious threads . Have you forgotten say
" A lot of different things could happen in the N. F. L. conference championship games on Sunday . But oddsmakers are pretty sure what is likely to happen . The New England Patriots will beat the Pittsburgh Steelers by about 6 and the Atlanta Falcons will defeat the Green Bay Packers by 4 or 5 in a affair . One of the truisms of gambling is that it is difficult for a team to be a great bet week in and week out . That ’s because the more a team wins and covers the spread the higher its spread will be the next week and the week after that . Eventually most teams congregate close to . 500 against the spread for the season . That makes this season for the Patriots all the more remarkable . Despite being favored in 15 of 16 games by as many as 17 points the Patriots finished against the spread earning a tidy profit for those who bet them blindly . That was the best record in the league . It seems hard to remember but in Week 1 the Patriots were underdogs to an Arizona Cardinals team that had impressed last season . Part of that gap was no doubt attributable to the status of quarterback Tom Brady who was sitting out the first game of his suspension for his role in the scandal involving the deflation of footballs . The unheralded backup Jimmy Garoppolo was up to the task though and the Patriots won in an “ upset ” that later events proved wasn ’t so much of one . The Cardinals finished . Favored in every game for the rest of the season the Patriots won 14 of 16 games and covered the spread in 13 of them . The only time they did not was in Week 12 at the Jets when the spread was 9½ and they won by 5. The Patriots more than made up for that four weeks later when they faced the Jets at home and were stuck with their biggest spread of the season 17 points . Bettors reluctant to lay so many points were burned when the Patriots romped to a win . By the time of the playoffs the bookmakers were well aware of the Patriots ’ tremendous record and posted a huge number 16 ½ for their game against the Houston Texans . The line seemed somewhat insulting to Houston which after all
" France — Two years ago Elisabeth Lavarde decided to quit her office job in Paris and start a new life in a small town with two butchers and one baker just south of the capital . Ms. Lavarde 39 is now an apprentice farmer at a farm that grows organic vegetables sold directly to local consumers . New farmers like Ms. Lavarde usually make what they see as a decent salary of about 1500 euros or about $ 1 600 a month slightly above the French minimum wage . “ I wanted a job with more meaning ” she said . “ I felt like I was tilting at windmills . ” Alongside the experienced farmer she has been paired with as part of a training program set up by an association that nurtures farmers Ms. Lavarde grows around 40 kinds of organic produce including tomatoes potatoes cauliflowers and carrots . As the sun was about to set behind rows of cauliflower plants on a recent afternoon Ms. Lavarde gazed over the land she cultivates . A few yards away a large shelter of tarpaulins rippled in the wind . Ms. Lavarde and her farming tutor Guilain Vergé 31 use the shelter to do their bookkeeping and to keep track of their crops on a whiteboard as they wait for authorization from the local government to build a decent barn . It ’s all hard work she acknowledges . But
" BERLIN — Germany ’s highest court rejected on Tuesday an attempt to ban the National Democratic Party the country ’s oldest political organization finding that it did not pose a danger to democracy even though its principles violate the Constitution . The ruling by the Federal Constitutional Court came after years of deliberation and at a time of in the country where another party Alternative for Germany is poised to win representation in Parliament in national elections this year . Although the National Democratic Party “ pursues aims contrary to the Constitution ” there was a lack of “ concrete supporting evidence ” that the party would be able to successfully achieve its goals and to pose a genuine threat said Andreas Vosskuhle the president of the court . “ That a party has aims that run contrary to the Constitution is not sufficient grounds for banning a party ” he said . Germany ’s 16 states submitted a petition in 2013 to ban the party citing its racist agenda but the law that allows a party to be banned is not based on “ sympathies or worldview ” but on evidence of a specific threat to the Constitution he said . Germany has strict laws on banning political parties and only two have been outlawed since the defeat of the Nazis at the end of World War II — the Socialist Reich Party in 1952 and the German Communist Party in 1956 . A 2003 attempt to ban the National Democratic Party also failed after the court found that paid informants in the party were partly responsible for evidence the government used . Over the past decade the party has continued to lose popularity
" The winner of the feature race on Monday at Aqueduct it was noted ran starting in front and ending that way as the race ’s second wagering choice . And yet despite the bettors ’ confidence the outcome was extraordinarily unusual and all but unnoticed . The winning owners are brothers who were born in Jamaica : Gaston and Anthony Grant . Gaston Grant served as the horse ’s trainer — a labor of love that he juggles with his job as a driver for UPS . The rider Kendrick Carmouche was a jockey from Louisiana . All are black . On a rare Monday of live horse racing at Aqueduct in South Ozone Park Queens the sight in the winner ’s circle was rarer still in a sport with few black participants and on a holiday card that coincided with Martin Luther King ’s Birthday . The winner ’s trophy for the race the Toboggan Stakes was even presented by Sentell Taylor Jr . a placing judge who has worked at New York tracks for more than 50 years Mr. Taylor is also black . “ After the race I said ‘ Would you look at this ? ’ ” Mr. Taylor remarked . “ It all fell into place . I was surprised . ” Still the significance and rarity of the moment seemed lost . It went unmentioned in various accounts of the race the New York Racing Association which runs Aqueduct did not note it on its social media accounts or in its news release . It even mostly escaped Gaston Grant the owner and trainer of the winner
" Judith Katherine Dunning had been waiting anxiously for California to adopt legislation that would make it legal for her to end her life . The cancer in her brain was progressing despite several rounds of treatment . At 68 she spent most of her day asleep and needed an aide to help with basic tasks . More centrally Ms. Dunning — who poignantly had worked as an oral historian in Berkeley Calif. — was losing her ability to speak . Even before the End of Life Option Act became law in October 2015 she had recorded a video expressing her desire to hasten her death . The video she hoped would make her wishes clear in case there were any doubts later on . “ She felt she had completed all the important tasks of her life ” recalled her physician Dr. Michael Rabow director of the symptom management service at the University of California San Francisco . “ When she could no longer communicate life was no longer worth living . ” In recent months this option has become available to a growing number of Americans . Last June legislation took effect in California the most populous state . In November Colorado voters approved a ballot measure by nearly a majority . The District of Columbia Council has passed a similar law and the mayor quietly signed it last month . Aid in dying was already legal in Washington
" Sometime in September 1943 Karoline Cohn undressed and waited for her hair to be shaved at a hut at Sobibor the Nazi extermination camp in eastern Poland . Then as Karoline 14 walked the final steps to the gas chambers most likely unaware that she was about to be killed she dropped a pendant engraved with the words “ good luck ” in Hebrew through the wooden floorboards . That at least is a leading theory to explain the pendant which was discovered more than 70 years later by archaeologists at the site of the extermination camp one of the most brutal in Hitler ’s killing apparatus . Tantalizingly the pendant — and Karoline — may also have a link to Anne Frank the young diarist who has become a powerful symbol of the Holocaust . “ There along the path to the gas chambers of Sobibor the pendant belonging to Karoline Cohn was taken dropped and remained buried in the ground for over 70 years ” said Joel Zisenwine director of the Deportations Database Project at the Yad Vashem Holocaust memorial which announced the discovery last weekend .

1.0"Democrats complained mightily about their questions being limited but the Republicans who hold the majority get to set the rules . Four of Donald J. Trump ’s cabinet choices faced aggressive questions but avoided any major stumbles . Here are 10 highlights : ■ Representative Tom Price of Georgia picked to be health secretary said repealing the Affordable Care Act would not leave millions without health insurance . ■ Mr. Price offered lofty goals for replacing the law but gave few details about the administration ’s plans . ■ He did not rule out cuts to Medicare or Medicaid . ■ Scott Pruitt the Oklahoma attorney general and the pick to lead the Environmental Protection Agency said he disagreed with Mr. Trump ’s statement that climate change is a “ hoax ” but hedged when asked how much of it is caused by human activity . ■ He defended what he called “ common sense ” environmental regulation arguing that farmers ranchers and business had been hurt by intrusive federal rules . ■ Mr. Pruitt said he would not deny the government ’s finding that carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases are a threat : “ That is a law of the land . ” ■ Wilbur Ross selected to be commerce secretary had a message for Mexico and Canada : Be ready to renegotiate the North American Free Trade Agreement . ■ Some Republicans said they were taken aback by Mr. Trump ’s threats to impose big tariffs but Mr. Ross assured them that the was merely being a good negotiator . ■ Gov. Nikki R. Haley of South Carolina Mr. Trump ’s choice for ambassador to the United Nations criticized the international body ’s treatment of Israel . ■ Ms. Haley said there would not be a Muslim registry in the United States . Mr. Price tried to offer reassurance that the Republican effort to repeal the Affordable Care Act would not leave millions of people suddenly without health insurance but Democrats challenged him repeatedly on that point . “ One of the important things that we need to convey to the American people is that nobody ’s interested in pulling the rug out from under anybody ” Mr. Price said . But Mr. Price gave up few details about Mr. Trump ’s plan . Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont
" WASHINGTON — The Obama administration has written 275 briefing papers for the incoming Trump administration : nearly 1000 pages of classified material on North Korea ’s nuclear program the military campaign against the Islamic State tensions in the South China Sea and every other kind of threat the new team could face in its first weeks in office . Nobody in the current administration knows whether anyone in the next has read any of it . Less than three days before President Obama turns the keys to the White House and the nuclear codes over to Donald J. Trump Mr. Trump ’s transition staff has barely engaged with the National Security Council below the most senior levels . His designated national security adviser Lt. Gen. Michael T. Flynn has met four times with his Obama counterpart Susan E. Rice most recently on Tuesday afternoon . But the chronic upheaval in Mr. Trump ’s transition a delay in appointing senior National Security Council staff members and a dearth of people with security clearances have deprived the Trump team of weeks of prep work on some of the most complex national security issues facing the country . “ We really wanted to make sure there was nothing a new team needed to know that we hadn ’t told them ” Ms. Rice said in an interview . “ It took them more time than we expected for them to be ready to engage with us . ” Now she added “ we ’re racing to make up lost time . ” Ms. Rice insisted that she was confident the Trump administration would have the information it needed by the time Mr. Trump was sworn in . The process has settled down in recent days with the arrival of Keith Kellogg a retired Army general whom Mr. Trump named as chief of staff of the N. S. C. last month and who is now running the transition . In a statement Mr. Flynn said “ Members of our incoming team have held extensive meetings with their N. S. C. counterparts . ” He thanked Ms. Rice for her “ cooperation and assistance . ” Last week
" WASHINGTON — Donald J. Trump in a speech Wednesday night at a dinner honoring his running mate Mike Pence jabbed at his new Republican allies and his critics alike questioned the ethics of “ super PACs ” and talked about creating a “ ” immigration system . Mr. Trump credited Mr. Pence with helping to bring critics around to the ticket . “ They all liked Mike . They were a little bit you know a little concerned with me ” the said drawing laughter from the crowd of about 500 people which included donors cabinet appointees and other supporters . Mr. Trump said that his aides told him that he was not required to be at the dinner but that he thought he had to be there to honor a man whose role on the ticket he described as one of his best decisions . Mr. Trump lauded Mr. Pence in a roughly speech but poked at him for declining to endorse his candidacy in the primary in Indiana where he was governor instead backing Senator Ted Cruz of Texas . “ The fact that every donor he had was in favor of ” Mr. Cruz played no role in the decision Mr. Trump said sarcastically according to a recording provided by a guest . In the ’s telling Mr. Pence essentially endorsed him and mentioned Mr. Cruz only as an afterthought . Mr. Trump also took aim at Mr. Cruz ( a “ smart guy he was a little late to the plate
" Anyone inclined to find joy when a president ’s taste collides with yours had a lot to choose from with Barack Obama . There was the time he dropped by the Los Angeles garage where the comedian Marc Maron records his podcast or when he sat between the two ferns where Zach Galifianakis pretends to be a boob hosting a talk show . At the 2015 White House Correspondents ’ Association Dinner he did a bit with Key as Luther Mr. Obama ’s fictional but legitimately irate “ anger translator ” from “ Key Peele . ” He called Kanye West a jackass invited Miranda to the White House Poetry Jam to perform a song from “ Hamilton ” before “ Hamilton ” was even a thing and for two straight years dropped thoroughly convincing Spotify playlists . That doesn ’t even include the New York Review of Books conversation ( in two parts ! ) between him and the novelist Marilynne Robinson . They talked about … about … well it ’s just sobering and oracular and you should read it . But of all the culture Barack Obama has been a part of inspired commented on or cultivated of all the ways in which the culture seemed to evolve around — and unconsciously respond to — him the thing that says so much about his unprecedented relationship to art and popular culture is actually in the vast scheme of things just a footnote . Which is to say it ’s pretty small yet so illustrative of his sense of respect professionalism and awe . It was the time he was emailed for a quote . The occasion was the 2015 Kennedy Center Honors . The inductees included Carole King who sat in the balcony between her fellow inductee George Lucas and the first couple . And during Ms. King ’s tribute out came Aretha Franklin who sat at a piano in a fur coat and sang “ ( You Make Me Feel Like ) A Natural Woman ” the classic Ms. King wrote and Ms. Franklin released in 1967 . Her appearance was pretty much expected . The shock was how powerfully good
" ANNAPOLIS Md . — It was early fall and Donald J. Trump behind in the polls seemed to be preparing a rationale in case a winner like him somehow managed to lose . “ I ’m afraid the election is going to be rigged I have to be honest ” the Republican nominee told a crowd in Columbus Ohio . He was hearing “ more and more ” about evidence of rigging he added leaving the details to his supporters ’ imagination . A few weeks later Cameron Harris a new college graduate with a fervent interest in Maryland Republican politics and a need for cash sat down at the kitchen table in his apartment to fill in the details Mr. Trump had left out . In a dubious art just coming into its prime this bogus story would be his masterpiece . Mr. Harris started by crafting the headline : “ BREAKING : ‘ Tens of thousands ’ of fraudulent Clinton votes found in Ohio warehouse . ” It made sense he figured to locate this shocking discovery in the very city and state where Mr. Trump had highlighted his “ rigged ” meme . “ I had a theory when I sat down to write it ” recalled Mr. Harris a former college quarterback and fraternity leader . “ Given the severe distrust of the media among Trump supporters anything that parroted Trump ’s talking points people would click . Trump was saying ‘ rigged election rigged election . ’ People were predisposed to believe Hillary Clinton could not win except by cheating . ” In a raucous election year defined by stories
" Like hundreds of young dancers before her Phoebe Pearl dropped everything to become a Rockette . Ms. Pearl was 19 when she quit the Boston Conservatory in 2009 to join the elite group of dancers — strong athletic and poised — who are as emblematic of New York City as the Empire State Building and the yellow taxi cab . For eight years she was proud to be a Rockette and the company treated her well with generous pay and health insurance . But in when management announced that the dancers would perform at the inauguration of Donald J. Trump Ms. Pearl did something that a Rockette is never supposed to do . She stepped out of line breaking with the silent smiling solidarity that defines the institution to denounce the idea of celebrating a man with a history of objectifying women . In a rare collision of presidential politics and a venerable arts organization current and former Rockettes find themselves in a new kind of spotlight — a position both painful and empowering — as they take sides over the inauguration a split illustrating the cultural divide that Trump has cleaved through the country . “ We are a group of women that is encouraging young girls to be strong independent women to fulfill their dreams to go for it ” Ms. Pearl 27 said in her first interview since the inaugural uproar began . “ It ’s about women ’s rights . ” But Patty DeCarlo Grantham the president of the Rockette Alumnae Association which has about 550 members
" WASHINGTON — Donald J. Trump on Wednesday selected Sonny Perdue the former governor of Georgia to be his secretary of agriculture two senior transition officials said making his final cabinet selection two days before he is to be sworn in as president . Mr. Perdue a onetime veterinarian who was elected in 2003 as Georgia ’s first Republican governor since Reconstruction campaigned heavily for Mr. Trump in the final months of the presidential race although he had initially backed a rival former Gov. Mike Huckabee of Arkansas . His selection ensures that Mr. Trump will enter office with a full complement of chosen cabinet officials although none have been confirmed . Senators are wrangling over how many nominees can be confirmed by the time Mr. Trump is sworn in on Friday with Republicans insisting on a series of quick votes and Democrats objecting that they have not had adequate time to vet the candidates many of whom submitted ethics disclosures late . The two officials confirmed the decision on the condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to comment on it before the formal announcement . Mr. Perdue has spoken with Mr. Trump in detail about his views on agriculture and trade including ways to ensure American producers are not placed at a disadvantage in international agreements . In an interview in December Mr. Perdue said Mr. Trump had quizzed him on what he would do about unfair trade deals . He said the “ believes that we in the U. S. have been sort of patsies over the years in the way we ’ve dealt with our foreign competitors and international trade . ” Mr. Perdue who once ran a grain and fertilizer business was among the first candidates Mr. Trump interviewed for the post . But the process dragged on for weeks as the ’s team debated whether it would be better off choosing someone from a different part of the country or selecting an ethnic minority to balance out an overwhelmingly white male and wealthy cabinet . Mr. Perdue though pitched himself as an asset with the business and governmental experience to be successful in the post . He spent much of his career in the agriculture business before being elected governor he told Mr. Trump and returned to the field in 2011 after leaving office . “ Most people focus on the governor term of eight years
" WASHINGTON — Until Tuesday the fight over Betsy DeVos ’s nomination to be secretary of education revolved mostly around her support of contentious school choice programs . But her confirmation hearing that night opened her up to new criticism : that her long battle for school choice controversial as it has been is the sum total of her experience and understanding of education policy . In questioning by senators she seemed either unaware or unsupportive of the longstanding policies and functions of the department she is in line to lead from special education rules to the policing of universities . Ms. DeVos admitted that she might have been “ confused ” when she appeared not to know that the broad statute that has governed special education for more than four decades is federal law . A billionaire investor education philanthropist and Michigan Republican activist Ms. DeVos acknowledged that she has no personal experience with student loans — the federal government is the largest provider — and said she would have to “ review ” the department ’s policies that try to prevent fraud by colleges . She appeared blank on basic education terms . Asked how school performance should be assessed she did not know the difference between growth which measures how much students have learned over a given period and proficiency which measures how many students reach a targeted score . Ms. DeVos even became something of an internet punch line when she suggested that some school officials should be allowed to carry guns on the premises to defend against grizzly bears . But if she was sometimes rattled on the specifics Ms. DeVos was unshakable in her belief that education authority should devolve away from the federal government and toward state and local authorities . Whether the issue was allowing guns in schools how to investigate sexual assault on college campuses or how to measure learning her answer was always that states and what she called “ locales ” knew best . Those answers reflected the same instinct that has driven her advocacy of school choice primarily vouchers which take money from public schools to help families pay tuition at private schools and charter schools which are publicly funded but typically independent of school district or union rules . As she said bluntly in a 2015 education speech “ Government really sucks . ” Ms. DeVos ’s supporters defended her performance at the hearing
" WASHINGTON — Donald J. Trump ’s choice for White House budget director failed to pay more than $ 15 000 in payroll taxes for a household employee he admitted in a statement to the Senate Budget Committee the sort of tax compliance issue that has derailed cabinet nominees in the past . In a questionnaire provided to the committee Representative Mick Mulvaney a conservative from South Carolina and vocal proponent of fiscal restraint noted “ I have come to learn during the confirmation review process that I failed to pay FICA and federal and state unemployment taxes on a household employee for the years . ” Mr. Mulvaney said he had subsequently paid more than $ 15 000 in taxes and awaits the state tax bill as well as penalties and interests . His confirmation hearing before the committee is scheduled for Jan. 24 . The employee was a babysitter hired when Mr. Mulvaney and his wife had triplets in 2000 . Attempts to reach Mr. Mulvaney ’s office for comment were not successful . A spokesman for the chairman of the Senate Budget Committee Senator Michael B. Enzi Republican of Wyoming said he would have no immediate comment . Mr. Mulvaney will almost certainly be asked about the issue at his hearing and Republicans on the committee are most likely aware of its existence . The situation is similar to that of former Senator Tom Daschle who in 2009 was forced to withdraw his nomination as President Obama ’s choice to lead the Health and Human Services Department . During Mr. Daschle ’s confirmation process it was revealed that he had paid roughly $ 140 000 in back taxes related to a car and driver provided to him by a former employer and to some consulting income . Senator John Cornyn of Texas who is now the Republican in the Senate said at the time that he would not support Mr. Daschle ’s nomination calling his tax issue “ a little too much to swallow . ” Mr. Daschle ’s withdrawal came two weeks after Timothy F. Geithner Mr. Obama ’s first Treasury secretary

" DAVOS Switzerland — You have perhaps noticed that in many countries numbers of people have grown enraged at the economic elite and their tendency to hog the spoils of globalization . This wave of anger has delivered Donald J. Trump to the White House sent Britain toward the exit of the European Union and threatened the future of global trade . The people gathered here this week in the Swiss Alps for the annual World Economic Forum have noticed this too . They are the elite — heads of state billionaire hedge fund managers technology executives . They are eager to talk about how to set things right soothing the populist fury by making globalization a more lucrative proposition for the masses . Myriad panel discussions are focused on finding the best way to “ reform capitalism ” make globalization work and revive the middle class . What is striking is what generally is not discussed : bolstering the power of workers to bargain for better wages and redistributing wealth from the top to the bottom . “ That agenda is anathema to a lot of Davos men and women ” said Joseph E. Stiglitz a Nobel laureate economist and author of numerous books on globalization and economic inequality . “ More rights to bargain for workers that ’s the part where Davos man is going to get stuck . The stark reality is that globalization has reduced the bargaining power of workers and corporations have taken advantage of it . ” Davos is — at least rhetorically — consumed with worries about the shortcomings of globalization . About the deepening anxieties of the middle class in many developed economies . About the threat of trade protectionism and its attendant hit to economic growth . About the fear that robots are on the verge of sowing mass unemployment . It is a conversation fueled in part by fear : If the world is indeed in the throes of a populist insurrection the pitchforks could do worse than to point here . The Davos elites have enjoyed outsize influence over economic policies in recent decades as a growing share of wealth has perhaps not coincidentally landed in the coffers of people with a need for bank accounts in the British Virgin Islands while poor and households have seen their earnings stagnate and decline . Yet the solutions that have currency seem calculated to spare corporations and the wealthiest people from having to make any sacrifices at all as if there is a way to be found to tilt the balance of inequality while those at the top hang on to everything they have . More entrepreneurialism mindfulness training education focused on the modern ways of technology : These are the sorts of items that tend to get discussed here as the response to the plight of those left behind by globalization . That perhaps private equity overseers should not be paid 1
" BRUSSELS — Antonio Tajani was elected president of the European Parliament on Tuesday and he won ’t have much time to settle in . Mr. Tajani an Italian who beat out his countryman Gianni Pittella in the fourth round of voting takes over as the European Union confronts an array of pressing issues . The Parliament is the only directly elected body among the bewildering list representing the European Union but it often struggles for relevance — a fact underscored when Mr. Tajani ’s ascendance on Tuesday was overshadowed by a speech by Prime Minister Theresa May of Britain on plans for her country to leave the bloc and an address by Xi Jinping the Chinese leader in Davos Switzerland . Mr. Tajani 63 from the European People ’s Party — the Parliament ’s largest political group with 217 members from 27 nations — was the favorite for the post . Mr. Tajani is something of an insider having previously worked alongside the former Italian prime minister Silvio Berlusconi who appointed Mr. Tajani nearly a decade ago to the European Commission the bloc ’s executive office . He served two terms there from 2008 to 2014 overseeing the transport sector and then taking the industry and entrepreneurship portfolio . Some members of the European Parliament criticized Mr. Tajani for failing to do enough in that role to address emissions from cars . “ He wasn ’t a commissioner who was very open transparent and fair ” Ska Keller a prominent German lawmaker with the Greens said on Tuesday . Mr. Tajani has sought to distance himself from the approach taken by his predecessor
" SEOUL South Korea — A South Korean court on Thursday blocked a prosecutor ’s attempt to arrest Jay Y. Lee the leader of Samsung saying there was not enough evidence that Mr. Lee had bribed President Park in a scandal that led to her impeachment . A justice on the Central District Court in Seoul Cho rejected the prosecutor ’s request to issue an arrest warrant saying said it was “ difficult to recognize the need ” to incarcerate Mr. Lee . Mr. Lee a scion and vice chairman of Samsung one of the world ’s biggest conglomerates was immediately released from a detention center outside Seoul where he had been waiting for the court to decide whether he should be formally arrested . South Koreans have paid keen attention to the fate of Mr. Lee . Some analysts said his case was a test of whether the country ’s relatively youthful democracy and judicial system are ready to crack down on the crimes of conglomerates . No Samsung leader has ever been jailed though the company has been investigated many times for corruption . The court ’s decision is likely to anger many South Koreans who have held weekend rallies calling for Ms. Park ’s ouster and the arrest of business tycoons on corruption charges . The special prosecutor called the court decision “ very regrettable . ” But he has yet to announce whether he will offer more evidence in a renewed effort to have Mr. Lee arrested . He can also indict Mr. Lee on bribery or lesser charges without arresting him . “ We will take necessary steps and persist in our investigation without wavering ” said Lee a spokesman for the special prosecutor without elaborating . Samsung welcomed the court ’s decision . For now the ruling allows Mr. Lee to continue to lead Samsung . It dealt a blow to the special prosecutor who had tried to build a bribery case against Mr. Lee and Ms. Park . Mr. Lee ’s father has twice been convicted of bribery and tax evasion but has never spent a day in prison . Each time he received a presidential pardon and returned to management . Mr. Lee 48 was accused of paying $ 36 million to Ms. Park ’s secretive confidante Choi . The special prosecutor and Mr. Lee ’s lawyers have been arguing over how to characterize the money . In November state prosecutors indicted Ms. Choi on extortion charges saying she leveraged her connections with Ms. Park to coerce Samsung and scores of other big businesses to contribute tens of millions of dollars to two foundations Ms. Choi controlled or to companies run by her or her associates . They identified Ms. Park as an accomplice
" DRESDEN Germany — At a beer hall on Tuesday evening the lean blond man ’s voice boomed out over a crowd of hundreds — some and but with a contingent of polished young professionals . “ The AfD is the last revolutionary the last peaceful chance for our fatherland ” declared the man Björn Höcke referring to the political party Alternative for Germany and employing a reverential term for Germany one of several nationalist buzzwords usually shunned in the country ’s politics . “ Jawohl ! ” a few shouted . “ Yes ! ” When Mr. Höcke ( pronounced ) lamented that “ German history is handled as rotten and made to look ridiculous ” — a subtle but clear reference to guilt for the Holocaust and other Nazi war crimes — the crowd responded by chanting “ Deutschland Deutschland . ” His speech at the rally in Dresden on Tuesday touched off a wave of national alarm by challenging Germany ’s national atonement for the Holocaust and for its Nazi crimes . His comments drew broad criticism for their venom and because Mr. Höcke a rising star in the AfD has found growing success with his messages of extreme nationalism . Shouting to be heard over cheering supporters many of whom stood Mr. Höcke challenged the collective national guilt over the war that has restrained German politics for three generations . At times he used language that seemed to hint at lamenting Nazi Germany ’s defeat . Germans were “ the only people in the world to plant a monument of shame in the heart of its capital ” he said referring to a memorial to murdered Jews in Berlin . He added that Germans had the “ mentality of a totally vanquished people . ” Mr. Höcke who began his speech by triumphantly raising his arms over his head represents the rightward flank of Alternative for Germany an already party . But his speech and the crowd ’s energetic reception of his words offer a glimpse of the relatively new party ’s threat to German politics . He is on the fringe but that fringe is growing in numbers and in willingness to defy the usual restraints
" Marking another milestone for a changing planet scientists reported on Wednesday that the Earth reached its highest temperature on record in 2016 trouncing a record set only a year earlier which beat one set in 2014 . It is the first time in the modern era of global warming data that temperatures have blown past the previous record three years in a row . The findings come two days before the inauguration of an American president who has called global warming a Chinese plot and vowed to roll back his predecessor ’s efforts to cut emissions of gases . In reality the Earth is heating up a point long beyond serious scientific dispute but one becoming more evident as the records keep falling . Temperatures are heading toward levels that many experts believe will pose a profound threat to both the natural world and to human civilization . In 2015 and 2016 the planetary warming was intensified by the weather pattern known as El Niño in which the Pacific Ocean released a huge burst of energy and water vapor into the atmosphere . But the bigger factor in setting the records was the trend of rising temperatures which scientists say is being driven by increasing levels of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases . “ A single warm year is something of a curiosity ” said Deke Arndt chief of global climate monitoring for the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration . “ It ’s really the trend and the fact that we ’re punching at the ceiling every year now that is the real indicator that we ’re undergoing big changes . ” The heat extremes were especially pervasive in the Arctic with temperatures in the fall running 20 to 30 degrees Fahrenheit above normal across large stretches of the Arctic Ocean . Sea ice in that region has been in precipitous decline for years and Arctic communities are already wrestling with enormous problems such as rapid coastal erosion caused by the changing climate . “ What ’s going on in the Arctic is really very impressive this year was ridiculously off the chart ” said Gavin A. Schmidt head of the Goddard Institute for Space Studies in Manhattan a unit of the National Aeronautics and Space Administration that tracks global temperatures . But Arctic people were hardly alone in feeling the heat . Drought and starvation afflicted Africa . On May 19
" On Tuesday President Obama pardoned or commuted the sentences of more than 270 people including Chelsea Manning a former Army intelligence analyst and Oscar López Rivera a Puerto Rican nationalist . Far down on the list attracting almost no attention was a boldface name from the disco days and nights of Manhattan in the 1970 s . Ian Schrager a hotelier and real estate developer whose club Studio 54 was a notorious celebrity hangout was among the 64 people granted a pardon in the waning moments of Mr. Obama ’s presidency . The wild nightclub was central in Mr. Schrager ’s conviction in 1980 on felony tax evasion charges he was accused of hiding money the club made from the government concealing some of it in trash bags and ceiling panels . With a portfolio that has included some of the most expensive residential real estate in Manhattan — and boutique hotels whose very concept he helped invent — Mr. Schrager seems to have little tangible need for a presidential intercession to set aside his conviction . He agrees to a point . “ I was able to overcome everything by being tenacious and I suppose relentless and having successful products ” he said in an interview on Wednesday . “ It wasn ’t something that I needed to continue business . ” Instead he said it was knowing that his son
" MIAMI — Alexis K. Manigo closes her eyes to sleep and sees images of her mother . She recalls the doting mom who took her to zoos aquariums and SeaWorld and marvels at how fortunate she was to have a parent who loved her unconditionally . But those memories are now complicated by an extraordinary drama that has played out over the week since Ms. Manigo 18 found out that she had been spirited away as a newborn from a hospital in Jacksonville Fla . that her real name is Kamiyah Mobley and that the woman she still thinks of as her mother has been charged with her abduction . She is still trying to make sense of it all . She met with her birth parents Craig Aiken and Shanara Mobley last weekend . But in her first newspaper interview since the case made headlines on Friday she said she did not have a cross word for Gloria Williams the woman who now stands accused of lurking for more than a dozen hours around a Jacksonville hospital on the July 1998 day Ms. Manigo was born looking for a newborn to snatch . “ I feel like I was blessed ” Ms. Manigo said in a telephone interview . “ I never had a reason to question a blessing like that someone loving you so much . ” Ms. Manigo said she never had cause to doubt her mother in the rural South Carolina community where she grew up . But the police say someone else clearly did . At least two tips were called in late last year to the Jacksonville Sheriff ’s Office some 200 miles away where the police still had an open case . “ A woman posing as a health care worker approached a young mother then 16 with a newborn and walked out of what was then University Medical Center with a baby and disappeared ” Sheriff Mike Williams recounted at a news conference on Friday . The woman wore flowered hospital scrubs and carried a purse
" On Wednesday for the second time this month someone called the Jewish community center outside Wilmington Del . and said a bomb was on the property . For the second time this month children were evacuated from schools gym patrons had their workouts interrupted and police dogs searched the campus . And for the second time this month it turned out to be part of a frightening nationwide hoax targeting Jewish facilities . “ It ’s concerning it ’s frustrating ” said Seth J. Katzen the chief executive of the Jewish Federation of Delaware whose staff trains several times a year for emergencies . “ But as in any J. C. C. across the country safety and security is our primary concern . ” There were as many as 27 bomb threats on Wednesday at Jewish centers in 17 states according to the J. C. C. Association of North America . Last week 16 Jewish facilities received bomb threats . No injuries were reported but nerves were rattled and routines disrupted . As in other places the police in Delaware said they were investigating and were in contact with the federal authorities . An F. B. I. official said the bureau and the Justice Department ’s Civil Rights Division were investigating “ possible civil rights violations in connection with threats ” to Jewish community centers across the country but declined to provide further details . Jewish leaders called the threats a sickening sign of the times but said individual centers had trained to address them . Both Wednesday and last week a national alert system for leaders of Jewish centers was activated as the menacing calls poured in . After the threats last week Jewish leaders said they had held an online training session with law enforcement officials that included tips on how to respond to bomb threats . Jewish community centers “ have prepared for situations like this ” said David Posner
" Iraq ’s government forces said on Wednesday that they had gained control of the eastern half of Mosul three months after they began an assault to retake the northern city from Islamic State militants . The Iraqi advance — the biggest military operation in the years since the United States ended its occupation of the country in 2011 — was aided by American air support and military advisers . But after weeks of heavy fighting and high casualties in areas of Mosul east of the Tigris River the older and more densely populated western neighborhoods of the city remain in Islamic State hands . Mosul which was Iraq ’s city when the Islamic State seized it in 2014 has become a focal point in the broader battle to crush the Islamic State the Sunni extremist group that claimed to have established a new Islamic caliphate in areas of Iraq and Syria . Tens of thousands of Mosul residents have fled since the Iraqi military began the recapturing operation in October beginning with sparsely populated outer districts . Roughly a million civilians are believed to still be in the city . Members of Iraq ’s counterterrorism service were the lead fighters in seizing eastern Mosul and they faced ferocious resistance from Islamic State defenders who had planted booby traps and sent suicide bombers to stop them . American warplanes sought to block the Islamic State from reinforcing fighters in the east by bombing the Tigris bridges linking it to the western side . Lt. Gen. Talib Shaghati of the Iraqi Army said on Wednesday that his forces had effectively taken control of the eastern side declaring that “ important lines and important areas are finished . ” He spoke at a news conference in Bartella a town east of Mosul . Prime Minister Haider of Iraq in a statement posted on his Twitter account extolled what he described as “ the efforts of our brave forces ” to retake Mosul . It remains unclear how long it may take to clear the western half which is characterized by narrow streets that could make the fight against entrenched Islamic State fighters even more treacherous . The triumphal moment on Wednesday was tempered by growing exasperation in the western city of Falluja where Iraqi forces and allied militias routed Islamic State fighters more than six months ago . Many neighborhoods were destroyed in that battle and residents have increasingly complained that much of the city remains uninhabitable . In a dispatch from the Falluja Agence quoted civilians as saying the lack of reconstruction services and jobs threatened to rekindle the resentment toward the government in Baghdad that had helped incubate support for the Islamic State among some members of the Sunni Arab minority . Iraqi officials have said they lack money for reconstruction hobbled by the country ’s overreliance on its oil industry which has been repeatedly disrupted by war and depressed by low prices . "
" A year ago Netflix boldly declared that it planned to conquer the global market for streaming television adding more than 130 countries to its service map . It also promised to start delivering material profits in 2017 after operating at profitability for several quarters . On Wednesday the company released business results showing that it is on its way to reaching those targets even as competition accelerates from services like Amazon and Hulu . Netflix added a record 7. 05 million streaming members in the three months that ended Dec. 31 up from the 5. 59 million net additions in the same period of 2015 . That growth in domestic and international markets beat its forecast of 5. 2 million new members for the quarter . Netflix now has a total of 93 . 8 million members . Fueling the increase in subscribers was a rapid rise in Netflix memberships abroad . The company said it is learning “ how best to match content with audiences tastes around the world . ” It added 5. 1 million international members in the quarter and now has 44 . 4 million members outside the United States more than than 47 percent of its total membership . Netflix cited its original series “ Marvel ’s Luke Cage ” and “ The Crown ” as worldwide hits . It said it planned to invest more than $ 6 billion in content this year up from $ 5 billion in 2016 . Profits are rising steadily . Net income increased 56 percent to $ 67 million in the quarter from the same period in 2015 . The company projected that profits would reach $ 165 million in the current quarter up from $ 28 million in the period a year ago . “ We don ’t really believe in businesses like suddenly we will turn significantly profitable at 200 million members ” Reed Hastings the chief executive of Netflix said during a conference call . “ We think it is much smarter to grow into that bit by bit . ” Competition in streaming television is becoming more fierce and remains a big challenge for Netflix . The company a pioneer in the market listed a number of competitors that are encroaching on its turf including Amazon which recently announced a global expansion and YouTube
" DAKAR Senegal — The number of people killed in an accidental military bombing at a Nigerian camp for displaced people has increased to 70 aid groups said on Wednesday with at least nine of them humanitarian workers . The mistaken attack came after a military plane targeted an area crowded with people fleeing Boko Haram militants . Medical workers were scrambling on Wednesday to assemble equipment to treat dozens of severely injured people who were still awaiting evacuation from the camp in Rann in northeastern Nigeria . At least 120 people were hurt in the errant strike on Tuesday by the Nigerian Air Force at the camp which is near the Cameroon border and houses about 20000 people . Initial reports put the death toll around 50 . Doctors Without Borders a humanitarian aid group said three employees of a Cameroonian firm that it hired to provide water and sanitation services in the camp were among the dead . Six local workers for the Nigerian Red Cross were also killed and 13 others were hurt . injured people were flown to hospitals in Maiduguri Nigeria the capital of Borno State . Among them were two young children : a named Yaa Zara with a fractured arm and Kaka Hauwa 5 whose neck was injured . One of the blasts was so forceful it knocked out two of Kaka ’s teeth the children ’s mother Fati Yasin 35 said on Tuesday . She said she left her two children at their home in the camp to collect tickets for food distribution when she heard the loud buzz of a fighter jet overhead . “ We looked at it in the sky and before we knew it it had dropped two bombs ” she said . The bomb struck around noon Tuesday just as aid workers were vaccinating children in the camp for measles and screening them for malnutrition
" In the latest twist in a legal issue that has galvanized musicians Paul McCartney filed a federal lawsuit on Wednesday against the music publisher over ownership of some of the Beatles ’ most famous songs . Mr. McCartney ’s suit is over what is known as copyright termination : the right of authors — or any creators — to reclaim ownership of their works from publishers after a specific length of time has passed . It was part of the 1976 copyright act and in recent years has become a potent force in the music industry as performers and songwriters have used the law to regain control of their work . In Mr. McCartney ’s suit filed in United States District Court in Manhattan lawyers for the singer detailed the steps they have taken over the last nine years to reclaim Mr. McCartney ’s piece of the copyrights in dozens of Beatles songs he wrote with John Lennon including “ Love Me Do ” “ I Want to Hold Your Hand ” and “ All You Need Is Love . ” That process involved filing numerous legal notices which the suit says should be enough to guarantee that would return the rights to Mr. McCartney starting in October 2018 . But the suit contends that late last year after the band Duran Duran lost a copyright suit in Britain executives at began to suggest to Mr. McCartney ’s lawyers that the rule might not apply to his songs . In the Duran Duran case a judge ruled that the band ’s original contract was governed by British law which barred it from reclaiming rights in the United States . Under United States law this power cannot be waived by contract . As Mr. McCartney ’s suit notes he and Mr. Lennon signed a series of publishing contracts in Britain beginning in 1962 . The suit contends that in a series of remarks and emails to Mr. McCartney ’s lawyers executives alluded to the Duran Duran case and refused to confirm that he could reclaim his rights . The suit asks for a declarative judgment that Mr. McCartney would not be violating any contract by exercising his termination rights . In a statement said that it had “ the highest respect for Sir Paul McCartney ” and that it worked closely with Mr. McCartney and the Lennon estate . But the company added “ We are disappointed that they have filed this lawsuit which we believe is both unnecessary and premature . ” For many musicians especially those who had hits decades ago
" celebrities may be staying away from Donald J. Trump ’s inauguration on Friday but a large number of religious leaders will take part in the ceremony reading Scripture and offering prayers for his administration . Six religious leaders — including a rabbi a cardinal and a diverse group of Protestant preachers — will participate more than for any previous president said Jim Bendat an author and historian of inaugural ceremonies . Each will have 60 to 90 seconds to offer a reading or lead a prayer . “ Some inaugurations have had just one others have had two or three covering different religions but this is a record ” Mr. Bendat said . Here are those who are scheduled to participate : Cardinal Dolan has been the Roman Catholic Archbishop of New York since 2009 . His participation in the inauguration has been controversial in part because he has criticized Mr. Trump . In a 2015 piece for The Daily News he described the as the manifestation of “ the ugly phenomenon called nativism ” that shaped American politics in the 19th and early 20th centuries . He said voters should “ take seriously the Bible ’s teaching that we are to welcome the stranger . ” Last week on his radio show the cardinal said he was “ honored ” to be invited to take part in the inauguration and said he would have done the same thing had Hillary Clinton won the election . “ It ’s not the person it ’s the office right ? ” he said . “ I pray with prisoners . That doesn ’t mean I approve of what they ’ve done . ” Mr. Rodriguez is the president of the National Hispanic Christian Leadership Conference an organization that says it represents roughly 100 million Hispanic evangelicals in the United States and Latin America . In a statement he said that he saw participating in the inauguration as “ not just a patriotic honor ” but “ as a sacred duty . ” Mr. Rodriguez has walked a tightrope in the past defending Mr. Trump against accusations of racism ( he called them “ hyperbole from the liberal media ” ) but also speaking up for undocumented immigrants many of whom attend evangelical churches . “ The vast majority are not rapists or murderers ” he said in an interview with the Christian Broadcasting Network . “ They ’re actually Christians committed to biblical orthodoxy or very staunch conservative Catholics . How about that ? So they ’re not rapists or murderers and we have to find a way of finding a solution . If we ’re not going to deport them
" Cate Blanchett is proving to be a strong draw on Broadway . “ The Present ” a new adaptation of a Chekhov play starring Ms. Blanchett in her Broadway debut last week grossed just over $ 1 million a sign of strength for any Broadway show but especially for a nonmusical play . One illustrative comparison : A revival this season of “ The Cherry Orchard ” also by Chekhov topped out at $ 384 000 during its best and final week of performances . “ The Present ” which opened on Jan. 8 received mixed reviews but has been selling well since beginning previews on Dec. 17 . Last week a week for Broadway over all was the strongest yet for “ The Present ” which had a healthy average admission price of $ 129 and played to 95 percent full houses according to figures released Wednesday by the Broadway League for the week ending Jan. 15 . The adaptation written by Ms. Blanchett ’s husband Andrew Upton is a modern take on Chekhov ’s first play which is most often produced under the title “ Platonov . ” Ms. Blanchett
" A magician walks into a laboratory . It ’s not the beginning of a joke . It ’s the subject of a declassified 1969 Central Intelligence Agency memo one of more than 930000 searchable documents that the agency posted online on Tuesday . The memo about the magician was among the more unusual files in the trove of declassified reports which include more than 12 million pages of dispatches and correspondence that document the history of the C. I. A. If you wanted you could read up on the United States government ’s research on “ spiritualist healers in Mexico ” the “ dreamlike structure of telepathic assertions ” or “ an assessment of the evidence for psychic functioning . ” Or you could examine the agency ’s actions and research during the Vietnam and Korean Wars . Maybe you would prefer to read through the files of Henry A. Kissinger who was secretary of state under Richard M. Nixon and Gerald R. Ford or a description of the Berlin Tunnel a wiretapping effort to monitor the Soviet Union during the Cold War . You can look through intelligence reports on specific countries or events find recipes for invisible ink or learn how to open sealed letters . “ It gives insight into a lot of different elements of our history since the 1940 s ” said Mike Best a journalist and archivist who pushed for the online publication of the files . Technically you could have gained access to the files before but only if you drove to the National Archives building in College Park Md . where there were four computers you could use to sift through the C. I. A. Records Search Tool known as Crest . You couldn ’t email or otherwise electronically transmit files to yourself but you could print them out on the C. I. A. ’s dime ( as long as the paper and ink hadn ’t run out ) . “ Access to this historically significant collection is no longer limited by geography ” Joseph Lambert the C. I. A. director of information management said in a statement . “ The American public can access these documents from the comfort of their homes . ” Mr. Best would often drive 90 minutes from southeast Pennsylvania to examine the documents . Nearby signs instruct users that their searches and printed files are being monitored he said . “ You ’re under surveillance for doing this entirely legal thing
" WASHINGTON — Former President George Bush the 41st president was in stable condition at a Houston hospital on Wednesday after doctors performed a procedure to clear his airway his spokesman said . His wife Barbara Bush was also admitted to the medical center Houston Methodist Hospital on Wednesday morning “ as a precaution after experiencing fatigue and coughing ” the spokesman Jim McGrath said in a statement . Mr. Bush 92 was suffering from an acute respiratory problem stemming from pneumonia when he was admitted to the intensive care unit at the hospital . After initial reports of Mr. Bush ’s hospitalization his office said he was expected to return home by the weekend . Mr. Bush who served as vice president from and president from refused to support Donald J. Trump for president in last year ’s election and had already declined to attend Friday ’s inauguration citing health concerns . Kathleen Kennedy Townsend daughter of Robert F. Kennedy said last fall that the former president had told her that he planned to vote for Hillary Clinton . His son former President George W. Bush and his wife Laura
" On Saturday hundreds of thousands of women are expected to march in Washington after Donald J. Trump is sworn in as the 45th president of the United States . This past Tuesday the Fiona Apple gave those preparing to protest a signature chant . The chant is on a new track called “ Tiny Hands ” which repeats 10 words recorded by Ms. Apple on a phone : “ We don ’t want your tiny near our underpants . ” The track includes a sample of Mr. Trump ’s comments from a 2005 leaked “ Access Hollywood ” recording with Billy Bush in which he brags of grabbing of women ’s body parts whenever he wanted . The track was produced by the composer Michael Whalen who released the song on SoundCloud where some commenters did not think that the chant went far enough . ”A reference to male rhetoric ? ” said one SoundCloud critic arguing that Ms. Apple should have included more substantive complaints . “ If that ’s the worst we can complain about him then maybe we should have all voted for him . ” Mr. Whalen responded that Ms. Apple ’s goal had simply been to create a chant for the march . A spokeswoman for Mr. Trump did not immediately respond to a request for comment on Wednesday . Online the song met with a scattering of criticisms from Mr. Trump ’s supporters who pointed out that those who normally denounce bullying were embracing derogatory and demeaning language about the future president . Ms. Apple who began her music career in the 1990 s has become something of a recluse . A New York Magazine article from 2012 labeled Ms. Apple a “ musical hermit . ” But her albums continue to be critically acclaimed . Her last L. P. released that year received a high aggregate score 89 on the website Metacritic and was her effort to date . Ms. Apple ’s new song is not the first time that Mr. Trump ’s comments from the incendiary recording have been repurposed by his opponents . A group of knitters united online to form “ The Pussyhat Project ” dedicated to creating 1. 1 million hats for protesters to wear at the march on Saturday . “ Tiny Hands ” is also not the indie singer ’s first protest song aimed at Mr. Trump . Last year Ms. Apple released a Christmas tune on Tumblr that made such ferocious use of a double entendre that its title can ’t be published in The New York Times . Ms. Apple has spoken publicly about being sexually assaulted at the age of 12 and has a history of airing her perspective on serious matters in her music . Accepting an MTV award for best new artist in 1997 she railed against the artificiality of the music industry referred to Maya Angelou as an inspiration and implored her fans to think for themselves .

" In an era of revivals and reboots this may have been inevitable . NBC announced on Wednesday that it was bringing back its celebrated comedy “ Will Grace ” for 10 episodes during the TV season . The show ’s original cast — Eric McCormack Debra Messing Sean Hayes and Megan Mullally — will all return as will the show ’s director James Burrows and the show ’s creators Max Mutchnick and David Kohan . TV is going through a 1990 s and early 2000 s nostalgia craze and “ Will Grace ” is far from the first show to make a comeback . Netflix ’s “ Full House ” revival “ Fuller House ” has already had two seasons . The streaming service also brought back “ Gilmore Girls ” in November . Fox brought back “ The ” with its original cast and it was a ratings hit for the network last year . “ Twin Peaks ” will return in May with many of the original cast members . “ Will Grace ” which ran from 1998 to 2006 was a hit and a critical darling — each of the lead cast members won an Emmy for their roles and the show won the best comedy Emmy in its second season . NBC is having the strongest year among the big four networks in the most important audience to advertisers : adults under 50 . But it is still in the midst of retooling its comedy slate and “ Will Grace ” could give it a shot in the arm whenever the show winds up running in the next season . Robert Greenblatt chairman of NBC Entertainment said in a statement “ This groundbreaking series for everything from gay rights to social and political commentary — all disguised as a train of witty pop culture — is coming back where it belongs . ” "
" When Donald J. Trump takes the oath of office on Friday he will do so with his hand on two Bibles : his own and one used by Abraham Lincoln in 1861 . Only one other president has used that Bible for the oath : Mr. Trump ’s predecessor . Thomas Barrack Jr . the chairman of Mr. Trump ’s inaugural committee said in a statement earlier this week that the “ is humbled to place his hand on Bibles that hold special meaning both to his family and to our country . ” Mr. Trump ’s personal Bible was given to him by his mother in 1955 two days before his ninth birthday according to a statement from the inaugural committee . He had just completed the Sunday Church Primary School at the First Presbyterian Church in Queens where he grew up . To use the Lincoln Bible the inaugural committee has to borrow it from its permanent home at the Library of Congress . Lincoln swore the oath on it at his first inaugural in 1861 as the United States stood on the cusp of the Civil War . It was not used again at an inauguration until the election of Barack Obama who was sworn in on it in 2009 and again in 2013 . Conservationists at the Library of Congress said the book was ready for another big day though they have wary eyes turned toward a weather forecast that hints at the possibility of rain . “ We always have it in the back of our mind that this might be happening ” said Elmer Eusman who is the head of conservation . “ So we ’re prepared . ” “ We already had made a protective box for it for Obama ’s inauguration ” he said adding that the library is creating a Mylar wraparound for the cover to protect it from rain . Mr. Eusman said the library would also have someone on standby who will be notified immediately if the Bible has been damaged and will whisk it back to a conservation lab for immediate repair . The steps are mostly precautionary . The Lincoln Bible is in good shape and “ it can certainly sustain this kind of activity ” said Mark Dimunation the head of rare books and special collections . The Bible was given to the library by Mary Lincoln the widow of Robert Todd Lincoln the president ’s son Mr. Dimunation said . The collection also included the contents of President Lincoln ’s pocket from the night he was killed . “ We ’ve used it from time to time in exhibitions
" Whether or not you eat what McDonald ’s serves let ’s at least agree the giant has a knack for putting together unexpected ingredients in a way that no one had seen before . The same could be said about “ The Founder ” the biographical film about Ray A. Kroc ( played by Michael Keaton ) the onetime salesman who helped transform McDonald ’s from a roadside stand in San Bernardino Calif. to an empire of golden arches . The movie ( in wide release Jan. 20 ) also stars Nick Offerman and John Carroll Lynch as Richard and Maurice McDonald the brothers ( known as Dick and Mac ) who created the namesake restaurants and invented the system then entered into an uneasy partnership with Kroc who took over the company . If Kroc is the engine of “ The Founder ” then the McDonald brothers are its heart — the loyal siblings whose ingenuity and traditional values are eventually overwhelmed by their new partner ’s relentless hustle . The characters also represent a rare pairing for Mr. Offerman ( a star of “ Parks and Recreation ” ) and Mr. Lynch ( whose films include “ Fargo ” “ Zodiac ” and “ Jackie ” ) two steadily working sturdily built actors known for quirky distinctive roles — outdoorsmen lawyers presidents mass murderers — that stick in your memory yet who had never acted together before . Mr. Offerman and Mr. Lynch spoke recently by phone about family relationships onscreen and off and shared their innermost thoughts about the McDonald ’s menu . These are edited excerpts from the conversation . You each own a very particular piece of turf in your individual careers . Did you ever cross paths in the industry before ? NICK OFFERMAN Thank you for accusing us of offering unique and individual work . JOHN CARROLL LYNCH Or having a place in this industry . I think we met the night before we started working . OFFERMAN There had been a couple of indie movies where I almost got cast in a thing or two that you were working in . And then they found out I had not worked at the Guthrie [ Theater ] and they moved on . LYNCH You ’ll be happy to know that I read for Ron Swanson [ on “ Parks and Recreation ” ] . I don ’t think we ever talked about that . OFFERMAN Oh no ! LYNCH Absolutely . Yes that ’s true . I read for Ron Swanson and they wisely chose Nick . OFFERMAN It must have been a height issue — that ’s the only thing I can think of . Was there any time to develop your familial bond before you started playing the brothers ? LYNCH We had one day of rehearsal . There were a couple of things that Nick and I were given for biographical background . There were recordings of Dick [ McDonald ] — Dictaphone audio memos to the company to listen to his voice and the way he regarded his brother . I remember hearing such great love and esteem in his voice . Also

" ■ Donald J. Trump soaked in the cheers at the opening concert as the inaugural festivities began . ■ But in downtown Washington D. C. revelers had to share the streets with adamant protesters . ■ Never fear though . Mr. Trump says his high I. Q. cabinet will unify the nation . The opening concert of the long inaugural was the stuff of legend — acts came followed by protests followed by withdrawals . Names were floated like Elton John and Charlotte Church only to have the artists publicly rebuke the invitation . But when it all finally came together a beaming Mr. Trump stood at the foot of the Lincoln Memorial on Thursday night basking in the applause from thousands of concertgoers and vowing to “ unify our country . ” “ But we ’re going to make America great for all of our people ” the told the crowd . “ That includes the inner cities that includes everybody . ” Just hours before he was to be sworn in Mr. Trump still recalled grievances from the campaign . “ The polls started going up up up but they didn ’t want to give us credit ” he said . But he also turned his attention to the future promising to work hard and saying he was looking forward to Friday .

1.0"WASHINGTON — Steven T. Mnuchin Donald J. Trump ’s pick to be Treasury secretary failed to disclose nearly $ 100 million of his assets on Senate Finance Committee disclosure documents and forgot to mention his role as a director of an investment fund located in a tax haven an omission that Democrats said made him unfit to serve in one of the government ’s most important positions . The revelation came hours before Mr. Mnuchin a former Goldman Sachs banker began testifying on Thursday before the Senate Finance Committee which has historically been bipartisan in its demands for transparency from nominees . Mr. Mnuchin was ready to outline his vision for the economy and defend himself against claims that he headed a bank that ran a “ foreclosure machine ” during the financial crisis . “ The Treasury secretary ought to be somebody who works on behalf of all Americans including those who are still waiting for the economic recovery to show up in their communities ” said Senator Ron Wyden the ranking Democrat on the committee . “ When I look at Mr. Mnuchin ’s background it ’s a stretch to find evidence he ’d be that kind of Treasury secretary . ” In a hearing marked by sharp exchanges Mr. Mnuchin struggled to answer questions about his use of tax havens as a hedge fund manager and whether he thought such loopholes should be closed . Senator Debbie Stabenow Democrat of Michigan pointedly asked Mr. Mnuchin if he was using Cayman Islands corporations to avoid taxation . He responded that he was working on behalf of his clients in accordance with the law . “ Let me just be clear again : I did not use a Cayman Islands entity in any way to avoid paying taxes for myself ” Mr. Mnuchin said . “ I would love to work with the I. R. S. to close these tax issues that make no sense . ” He added : “ I would support changing the tax laws to make sure they are simpler and more effective . ” Republicans came to Mr. Mnuchin ’s defense suggesting that none of his omissions were willful and they gave strong indications that they would vote for him .

" WASHINGTON — No Beyoncé . No Jon Bon Jovi . No U2 . But no matter : For many of the thousands gathering at the Lincoln Memorial on Thursday afternoon for the preinaugural concert the artists in the lineup were secondary to the chance to celebrate the coming presidency of Donald J. Trump . The day ’s programming was heavy on country music “ God Bless America ” and a hefty number of bagpipes . Two friends Kim Shourds and Susan Perkins Lovelady drove in from Norfolk Va . to attend the evening ’s concerts . They danced and sang along to “ God Blessed Texas ” but as they took a break they said the volatile political climate wasn ’t far from their minds . “ This is a celebration of America ” Ms. Perkins Lovelady 53 said . “ After all of the negativity of the past year all of the positivity is a good thing . It ’s a heartsore country . ” Kenny and Katherine Dunham decided to make the drive from Kinston N. C. after hearing that Representative John Lewis of Georgia would boycott Mr. Trump ’s inauguration . The Dunhams were not fazed by the lack of entertainers . “ I think if they don ’t want to perform they shouldn ’t perform ” Mr. Dunham 60 said . “ But at the same time my understanding is they weren ’t asked to . Toby Keith is going to perform . Lee Greenwood is going to perform . ” Some of the loudest cheers of the evening were for Jon Voight the only Hollywood actor to lend his name to the event as he spoke to the crowd about the “ barrage of propaganda ” that Mr. Trump had faced in his race to the presidency . “ He certainly didn ’t need this job
" Pity the poor billionaires who are about to take the oath of office . For them everything is going to change . In winning the presidency Donald J. Trump proposed a grand hypothesis : that the federal government can be managed like a business . “ If we could run our country the way I ’ve run my company we would have a country that you would be so proud of ” he told voters in the final presidential debate . It ’s a theory that has been suggested to various degrees by almost every president in the last century from Calvin Coolidge to Barack Obama . What ’s different this time is the vigorousness of the experiment . With his inauguration on Friday and a cabinet that is likely to include three billionaires five former chief executives and some of the business world ’s most accomplished leaders Mr. Trump is poised to test perhaps once and for all if good governance and crafty deal making are really similar skills . But as anyone who has spent time in a laboratory can attest experiments are messy . Separating the signals from the noise takes diligence . And in this case so much will depend on the savviness of those woeful billionaires who had it so good and now will be guinea pigs thrust into a maze that has overwhelmed so many test subjects before them . “ Running an agency is very very different from running a company ” said Carlos M. Gutierrez who was commerce secretary under George W. Bush after serving as chief executive of Kellogg’s . “ Some of the skills do transfer
" WASHINGTON — Out with almonds in with Doritos . At the stroke of 12:01 p. m. on Friday as soon as Donald J. Trump is sworn in as president and Barack Obama relinquishes the office dozens of federal workers will swing into action at the White House to replace one commander in chief ’s creature comforts — favorite snacks clothes toiletries artwork and furniture — with those of his successor . The process months in the planning but mere hours in its militarylike execution unfolds mostly away from public view as Americans and the world focus on the pageantry of Inauguration Day : the presidential oath and address at the Capitol a parade down Pennsylvania Avenue the balls . For the roughly 100 people who work in the White House and the employees on hand to help them with perhaps the world ’s moving day the official events double as useful distractions that keep the exiting president and his family and the incoming occupants during the work . “ It ’s very busy — you are on your feet constantly making sure things are going in the right place and in the right way and there is very little time to spare ” said Betty Monkman a White House curator for more than three decades who helped supervise the changeover in 2001 when Bill Clinton was moving out and George W. Bush was coming in . “ The housekeeper and maids are all getting the clothes in the closet and cosmetics and toiletries in the bathrooms the kitchen staff is preparing the food . There is a lot going on . ” Mr. Obama and his wife Michelle who plan to move to a house less than two miles from the White House so they can remain in Washington while their younger daughter
" WASHINGTON — Rick Perry the former Texas governor and Donald J. Trump ’s nominee as energy secretary said in his Senate confirmation hearing on Thursday that he regretted having recommended the abolition of the Energy Department in the past . He addressed his awkward history on the issue up front telling the Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee that after “ being briefed on so many of the vital functions of the Department of Energy ” he no longer believed as he said while running for president in 2011 that it should be eliminated . Mr. Perry also offered a reversal of his views on the science of climate change which he called a “ contrived phony mess ” in a 2010 book . “ I believe the climate is changing ” he said . “ I believe some of it is naturally occurring but some of it is also caused by activity . The question is : How do we address it in a thoughtful way that doesn ’t compromise economic growth the affordability of energy or American jobs ? ” Mr. Trump by contrast has called climate change a “ hoax ” and has continued to express doubts about established climate science . Mr. Perry also appeared to signal a somewhat different position from Mr. Trump on nuclear weapons policy the Energy Department ’s chief portfolio . Mr. Trump has said the United States must “ greatly strengthen and expand ” its nuclear capability “ Let it be an arms race ” he said . But Mr. Perry asked by Senator Bernie Sanders the Vermont independent whether he believed expanded testing of nuclear weapons was a “ dangerous idea ” replied
" WASHINGTON — In the final weeks of the Obama administration the Justice Department won the first case involving a transgender victim and sued two cities for blocking mosques from opening . Prosecutors settled charges with two banks then sued a third . They filed legal briefs on behalf of New York teenagers being held in solitary confinement and accused Louisiana of forcing mentally ill patients into nursing homes . And then with days remaining prosecutors announced a deal to overhaul Baltimore ’s Police Department and accused Chicago of unconstitutional police abuses . The moves capped a historic and sometimes controversial span in which the Justice Department pushed the frontiers of civil rights laws inserting itself into private lawsuits and siding with transgender students juvenile prisoners the homeless the blind and people who videotape police officers . On issues of gay rights policing criminal justice voting and more government lawyers argued for a broad interpretation of civil rights laws a view that they consistently said would put them on the right side of history . Few areas of federal policy are likely to change so definitively . Donald Trump ’s nominee to be attorney general Senator Jeff Sessions of Alabama opposes not only the Justice Department ’s specific policies on civil rights but its entire approach . While liberal Democrats have criticized Mr. Sessions ’s views on specific issues like gay marriage and voting the larger difference is how differently the Trump administration will view the government ’s role in those areas .

1.0"MEXICO CITY — Joaquín Guzmán Loera the notorious drug lord known as El Chapo who twice slipped out of Mexican prisons and into criminal legend was extradited to the United States on Thursday night officials said drawing to a close a quest to prosecute the head of one of the world ’s largest narcotics organizations . A federal court in Mexico denied an appeal by Mr. Guzmán ’s lawyers to block the extradition clearing the way for his transfer to the American authorities in New York where he faces numerous charges for his role as the chieftain of the Sinaloa cartel . Mr. Guzmán was put on a plane on Thursday in Ciudad Juárez near the border with Texas and arrived in the United States on President Obama ’s final night in office . According to a Justice Department statement late Thursday he was flown to Long Island MacArthur Airport in Islip N. Y. The decision to extradite Mr. Guzmán was an for the Mexican government which once claimed that he would serve his long sentence in Mexico first . However after his escape in 2015 when his associates tunneled him out of Mexico ’s most secure prison officials began to reconsider . When he was recaptured early last year after one of Mexico ’s most exhaustive manhunts the government publicly said it would allow the extradition of Mr. Guzmán thus relieving itself of the potential embarrassment of another escape and preventing further souring of its relationship with the United States . Mr. Guzmán ’s extradition came suddenly after nearly a year of appeals and legal procedures . Even his own lawyer was surprised . In an interview after the announcement by the Mexican government
" When C. I. A. interrogators in a Thailand prison sent a cable to agency headquarters recounting that they had been slamming Abu Zubaydah a captured terrorism suspect against a wall they emphasized that they were obeying instructions to take steps to prevent his injury like putting a towel behind his neck and described the practice in detached terms . “ Subject was walled with the question ‘ What is it that you do not want us to know ? ’ ” reported a cable from Aug. 52002 part of a trove of newly disclosed documents about the agency ’s “ enhanced interrogation ” program . “ Subject continued to deny that he had any information . ” From the perspective of Mr. Zubaydah — whom interrogators eventually conceded had no additional information contrary to their suspicions at the time — the experience felt far different . “ He kept banging me against the wall ” Mr. Zubaydah told his lawyer in 2008 in a narrative that has now been declassified . “ Given the intensity of the banging that was strongly hitting my head I fell down on the floor with each banging . I felt for few instants that I was unable to see anything let alone the short chains that prevented me from standing tall . And every time I fell he would drag me with the towel which caused bleeding in my neck . ” Batches of newly disclosed documents about the Central Intelligence Agency ’s defunct torture program are providing new details about its practices of slamming terrorism suspects into walls confining them in coffinlike boxes and subjecting them to waterboarding — as well as internal disputes over whether two psychologists who designed the program were competent . The release of the newly available primary documents which include information not discussed in a executive summary of the Senate Intelligence Committee ’s investigation into the C. I. A. torture program that was released in 2014 comes at the same time as an urgent legal battle is unfolding over the potential fate of the full version of that report . Lawyers for two detainees who were subjected to the C. I. A. ’s most extreme “ enhanced ” interrogation techniques Mr. Zubaydah and Abd the suspected mastermind of the deadly October 2000 attack on the American destroyer Cole are asking federal judges to order the executive branch to deposit a copy of the full report with the judiciary to ensure that the Trump administration and congressional Republicans do not destroy it . But the Obama administration in its waning hours is fighting that idea . On Thursday

Near Chicago a former graduate student who had a financial windfall sent in a $ 10 000 check to pay off his loans — and the payment was promptly lost . The same thing happened to a woman in Maryland who uncovered the problem three years later after her loan had grown by $ 11 000 . And in New York City a homeless man who should qualify for reduced monthly payments has been pleading for a break on his loan payments but says that no one is listening . Sound familiar ? State and federal lawsuits filed this week accused Navient the largest collector of student loan payments in the nation of the kind of sloppiness and misleading tactics that emerged in the mortgage market in the years after the financial crisis . The company which is fighting the lawsuits has denied wrongdoing . “ Navient has a superior track record of helping student loan borrowers succeed in repayment ” Patricia Nash Christel a company spokeswoman said in a written statement . “ We will vigorously defend against these false allegations . ” The accusations against Navient by the nation ’s consumer watchdog agency and attorneys general in two states are aggravating a student loan crisis that has swept the United States .

" BERLIN — Volkswagen ’s former chief executive Martin Winterkorn yielded no ground on Thursday during a polite grilling by German lawmakers over the carmaker ’s deception but he astonished them by insisting that he had not heard the term “ defeat device ” before September 2015 when the scandal broke . Appearing in public for the first time since he resigned over the case Mr. Winterkorn who worked at the company for more than 35 years contended as he has all along that he had not been aware of any wrongdoing . But his assertions are increasingly difficult to defend after Volkswagen pleaded guilty in the United States last week to criminal charges that included conspiracy to defraud the government violations of the Clean Air Act and obstruction of justice . The company is paying $ 20 billion to resolve civil and criminal charges related to the scandal . Mr. Winterkorn who has not been charged was chief executive throughout the decade when as Volkswagen now admits employees devised software known as a “ defeat device ” that could hide excess pollutants during testing by regulators . The employees including several managers covered up the wrongdoing for years . But in his comments on Thursday Mr. Winterkorn reiterated that he had not known of the efforts to evade emissions rules . “ How striving for perfection could end this way ” mystified and preoccupied him Mr. Winterkorn told a parliamentary committee charged with investigating the scandal and with determining if the German government had been aware of it before the news broke . “ The unthinkable has happened and we must all deal with it . ” It was doubly difficult to imagine
" ROME — As night fell in Italy ’s Apennine Mountains on Thursday prospects dimmed of finding survivors of an avalanche that had swept over a small resort hotel the previous night . At least 30 people were missing according to the authorities . The avalanche occurred after four earthquakes struck central Italy which has been hit hard in recent months . Giampiero Parete a cook at the Rigopiano hotel and one of the two known survivors had gone out to get something from his car when the avalanche struck . His wife and two young children remained inside and are among the missing . Quintino Marcella a restaurateur told the Italian newspaper Corriere della Sera that he had received a frantic call for help from Mr. Parete on Wednesday night . Mr. Parete told him that the hotel had been wiped out : “ The hotel isn ’t here anymore it ’s not here ” Mr. Marcella told the newspaper . He said that the guests had been waiting for a snow plow to clear the roads . “ All the guests had their bags packed and were waiting to leave ” he said . Mr. Marcella said that he called the prefecture in Pescara and an official told him that they had spoken to the hotel a few hours earlier and that everything was under control . “ I insisted ” Mr. Marcella told Corriere della Sera . He said that he called police the carabinieri until someone finally said “ maybe there ’s something there . ” The authorities told the Italian media that they responded as soon as they learned of the disaster . The latest seismic activity which prompted officials to close schools and the subway system in Rome as a precaution shifted the nation ’s attention back to areas in central Italy that were devastated by last year ’s earthquakes leading to criticism that victims had been left to fend for themselves .

The attack which also included strikes by armed reaper drones flying from a base in Sicily was a parting shot from President Obama at the Islamic State also known as ISIS or ISIL and one of his final actions as commander in chief . “ We need to strike ISIL everywhere they show up ” Ashton B. Carter the departing defense secretary told reporters . “ We know that some of the ISIL operatives in Libya were involved in plotting attacks in Europe . ” Islamic State fighters were driven out of Surt the group ’s coastal stronghold last year by Libyan fighters backed by American air power . After conducting 495 strikes against truck bombs heavy guns tanks and command bunkers in the city the Pentagon ’s Africa Command announced an end to air operations on Dec. 19 . But the taking of Surt did not put an end to Islamic State operations in Libya . The militant group is believed to have several hundred fighters in the country . Many of them including fighters who fled from Surt began to regroup at two training camps about 25 miles southwest of the city officials said . When the initial flurry of airstrikes in Surt were completed last year Mr. Obama asked to be notified if the Pentagon saw another opportunity to strike . On Monday Mr. Obama approved airstrikes against the camps . “ We had 100 terrorists training
" TEHRAN — The scene unspooled as if in a disaster film : As firefighters fought to control a blaze in one of Tehran ’s most prominent buildings the structure suddenly collapsed on Thursday in a smoldering heap of wreckage — all while millions watched on Iranian state television . The channel PressTV said that at least 20 firefighters were confirmed dead and that dozens of people could be trapped beneath the rubble . But other local news agencies said that as many as 50 firefighters and shopkeepers could have been inside the building when it collapsed . “ It was total chaos there was dust there were people everywhere . No one knew what to do ” said Nasim Khakpour a Tehran resident who had gone to buy a guitar for her brother in the area . Firefighters had battled the blaze for several hours as police officers tried to shoo away shopkeepers trying to return to collect their valuables PressTV reported . Then came the collapse . As the building fell a television journalist reporting in front of the building suddenly raised his voice . Onlookers could be heard gasping and shrieking . Several firefighters burst into tears . “ They had been trying to put out the fire for hours when suddenly the building just collapsed ” said Ibrahim Najafi a cosmetics seller who could see the building crashing down from his shop window . He said there were 590 stores offices and warehouses in the building . “ My friends are in there . What a horrible day . ” People at the scene were visibly upset and the police were required to control angry crowds who yelled at security forces who they said had arrived too late . “ My friend is calling me from under the rubble help him ” one man was heard shouting . In the chaotic aftermath of the collapse ambulances had to fight their way through onlookers drawn to the scene some taking selfies in front of the rubble . Army conscripts were deployed to clear paths for the emergency vehicles . The the Plasco Building in the center of Tehran housed a shopping center and garment manufacturers and it was as familiar to most residents as the Empire State Building is in New York . Built in 1962 by Habib Elghanian an businessman and named for his company
" A of lead exploded from the barrel of a pistol at 1300 feet per second . The bullet sped toward Carlos Vasquez who ran just steps ahead of the gunman . But it missed its mark just outside the Melrose Houses in the South Bronx and kept whistling through the air . It sailed for 150 yards along East 154th Street down the slope between Courtlandt and Elton Avenues staying airborne as the ground fell away . Maribel Cavero 45 was crossing the street at the base of that hill unaware that a shot had been fired during a running fight between young men in the housing project . She had just delivered a carton of sugar substitute to her diabetic grandmother on East 154th Street and was on her way to pick up her niece from school . The bullet slowed and tumbled as it dropped . Then with the last of its fading energy it tore into Ms. Cavero . Alejandro Almonte 45 a heard Ms. Cavero yelp and saw her fall . He later said he thought she must have had a seizure . He ran to where she lay facedown on the blacktop by a small car ’s bumper . She was dying the bullet having pierced her heart at about 12:50 p. m. on Nov. 2 a sunny Wednesday . The slug passed through her chest and rolled to a stop under a Jeep parked near a house at 426 East 154th Street . The bullet was strangely pristine hardly deformed by its deadly work .

" DAVOS Switzerland — For the investors and at the annual World Economic Forum here a threat lurks . At cocktail parties where the Champagne flows financiers have expressed bewilderment over the rise of populist groups that are feeding a backlash against globalization . In the halls of the Davos Congress Center where many of the meetings this week are taking place investors have tried to make sense of the political upheaval . The world order has been upended . As the United States retreats from the promise of free trade China is taking up the mantle . The stark shift leaves investors trying to assess the new risk and opportunities in the global economy . “ This is the first time there is absolutely no consensus ” said William F. Browder a of Hermitage Capital Management who has been coming to Davos for 21 years . “ Everyone is looking into the abyss . ” The religion of the global elite — free trade and open markets — is under attack and there has been a lot of over what Christine Lagarde of the International Monetary Fund has declared a “ crisis . ” But while all attendees in Davos have a view on the state of the world there is little agreement on how to deal with it . The biggest concern ? Finding a way to make the people who are driving populist movements feel like they are part of the global economic pie that Davos participants have created and largely own . In a Twitter post from the Swiss resort Ian Bremmer the president of Eurasia Group a firm offered his advice : “ Elites won ’t be able to manage populism until they stop seeing it as a threat and start seeing it as a symptom . ” If that is the case Davos has so far made little progress . “ I want to be loud and clear : Populism scares me ” Ray Dalio the billionaire hedge fund manager said during a panel on how to fix the crisis . “ The No. 1 issue economically as a market participant is how populism manifests itself over the next year or two . ” But Mr. Dalio offered little by way of a solution
1.0"Roberta Peters the coloratura soprano who at 20 was catapulted to stardom by a phone call a subway ride and a Metropolitan Opera debut — her first public performance anywhere — all in the space of five hours died on Wednesday at her home in Rye N. Y. She was 86 . The cause was Parkinson ’s disease her son Bruce Fields said . Ms. Peters who would sing with the Met 515 times over 35 vigorous years was internationally renowned for her high silvery voice ( in private she could hit a high A two and a half octaves above middle C ) her clarion diction in a flurry of languages her attractive stage presence and by virtue of the fact that she and television came to prominence at about the same time her wide popular appeal . “ As a coloratura ” Cue magazine wrote of Ms. Peters in 1960 “ she has no peer . ” In addition to the Met with which she appeared regularly from 1950 to 1985 — one of the longest associations of any singer with a major opera company — Ms. Peters was heard at the Lyric Opera of Chicago Cincinnati Opera the Vienna State Opera Covent Garden and elsewhere . Her roles include the Queen of the Night in Mozart ’s “ The Magic Flute
" Our fellow primates are in trouble . In a study of unprecedented scope a team of 31 primatologists has analyzed every known species of primate to judge how they are faring . The news for man ’s closest animal relatives is not good . of primate species are in decline the researchers found and about 60 percent are now threatened with extinction . From gorillas to gibbons primates are in significantly worse shape now than in recent decades because of the devastation from agriculture hunting and mining . “ I think we ’re going to get quite a number of extinctions within next 50 years if things go on the way they are ” said Anthony B. Rylands a senior research scientist at Conservation International and a of the new study which was published in Science Advances . “ It ’s a landmark paper ” said Anne D. Yoder the director of the Duke Lemur Center who was not involved in the study . “ It ’s alarming without being alarmist . ” Taking stock of every primate species on Earth was a huge challenge in part because scientists keep finding new ones . Since 2000 85 new primate species have been identified bringing the total to 505 . Just last week a team of researchers described a new species of gibbon in China . Dr. Rylands said he knows of at least seven new primate species to be announced this year . Scientists are finding so many new primate species in part because the destruction of forests is making it easier to reach populations that were once remote . “ There is a certain rush of people in a panic realizing that if they don ’t find and describe them they will be lost without us ever knowing them ” said Dr. Rylands . Another reason for the burst of discovery is that scientists have started investigating the DNA of primates finding that some populations had unique mutations. . “ There are distinct species that have been around for millions of years
" In the fall of 2012 a fisherman and carver named Terry St. Germain decided to enroll his five young children as members of the Nooksack a federally recognized Native American tribe with some 2000 members centered in the northwestern corner of Washington State . He ’d enrolled his two older daughters from a previous relationship when they were babies but hadn ’t yet filed the paperwork to make his younger children — all of whom including a set of twins were under 7 — official members . He saw no reason to worry about a bureaucratic endorsement of what he knew to be true . “ My kids they love being Native ” he told me . St. Germain was a teenager when he enrolled in the tribe . For decades he used tribal fishing rights to harvest salmon and sea urchin and Dungeness crab alongside his cousins . He had dozens of family members who were also Nooksack . His mother according to family lore was directly descended from a Nooksack chief known as Matsqui George . His brother Rudy was the secretary of the Nooksack tribal council which oversaw membership decisions . The process he figured would be so straightforward that his kids would be certified Nooksacks in time for Christmas when the tribe gives parents a small stipend for buying gifts : “ I thought it was a situation . ” But after a few months
" With its grasslands and oppressive heat the middle of the Namib Desert may seem like a strange place to go fishing . Yet there Jennifer Guyton and Tyler Coverdale were standing in a sea of orange sand and brittle yellow grass with their carp pole . But the two Princeton graduate students weren ’t trying to catch some sort of dogfish or a literal “ sand shark . ” That would be absurd . Instead they had swapped the hook with a camera so they could investigate the scenery around something much more scientifically sensible : fairy circles . That is what scientists call the mysterious bald spots speckled across Namibia ’s grasslands . The rings are six feet to 115 feet wide and are regularly spaced out in a hexagon or honeycomb pattern . As their ethereal name would imply fairy circles have long bewildered researchers as to their origins . But a new study published on Wednesday in the journal Nature that Ms. Guyton and Mr. Coverdale were involved in seeks to offer some insights into how the enchanting landscapes may have formed . Although the name fairy circles sounds sweet and peaceful there is passionate scientific disagreement over how they arise and the two prevailing hypotheses have become adversaries in the dispute . One side suggests that termites locked in competition with neighboring colonies create the circles as they fight for dominance and resources . The other says that perpetually thirsty plants simultaneously assist and compete with their neighbors ’ roots causing the vegetation to “ ” into the patterns . The new study suggests that termites and plants may be jointly responsible for forming fairy circle landscapes in Namibia . And it has received mixed reviews from scientists entrenched in the dispute . “ We thought both sides of the debate bring in compelling arguments for each of these mechanisms so why should it be one or the other ? ” said Corina Tarnita an ecologist from Princeton University and the study ’s author . Dr. Tarnita worked with Juan Bonachela a mathematician from the University of Strathclyde in Scotland to test the termite and plant explanations in a computer model . They found that either hypothesis could generate the fairy circle features . But when they tested both mechanisms together the model revealed a second smaller pattern hidden within the clumps of grass between the fairy circles . “ Everyone was focusing on the circles and not what was happening in between them ” said Robert M. Pringle an ecologist at Princeton and another author on the paper . The next step for the team was to confirm that this second vegetation pattern existed in nature . So they sent Ms. Guyton and Mr. Coverdale to Namibia in 2015 with their camera and fishing pole . Ms. Guyton said that each of the grassy patterns was as different as fingerprints but were mathematically similar . By comparing the photos with their model the team verified that the second pattern did exist in the grass surrounding the Namibian fairy circles . That finding they said
" Donald J. Trump will become president of the United States after he says just 35 words : the oath of office . What is the oath you may ask ? have taken the oath since the beginning of the republic . George Washington first said it in 1789 and the oath has been the centerpiece of presidential inaugurations ever since symbolizing the continuity of democratic rule and the peaceful transition of power . The oath of office comes directly from Article II Section 1 of the Constitution . This is the full text according to the National Museum of American History : The oath is traditionally administered by the chief justice of the United States but sometimes that can be harder than it looks . In 2009 Justice John G. Roberts Jr . garbled the oath while swearing in Barack Obama . Chief Justice Roberts misspoke — he said “ I will execute the office of president to the United States faithfully . ” Then he left out the word “ execute ” altogether . Mr. Obama for his part seemed to realize the chief justice ’s mistake . Mr. Obama ’s aides said that they believed the oath was valid even if it had not gone according to plan . But he was sworn in a second time before a small private audience the next day — just to make sure . Before they began Mr. Obama joked with the chief justice “ We ’re going to do it very slowly . ” "
" The red carpet premiere for the film “ A Dog ’s Purpose ” scheduled for Saturday has been canceled amid calls for a boycott after a video surfaced on Wednesday showing a German shepherd being forced into rushing waters during filming . In the video obtained by TMZ the dog appears to be fighting to stay out of the stream as a man in a green suit wrestles to put the animal in . The footage then cuts to a scene of the dog submerged as people swim toward it . A voice can be heard yelling : “ Cut it ! Cut it ! ” The source of the video recorded in 2015 was not immediately clear but the filmmakers have not disputed its authenticity . The identity of the man in the video was also not immediately revealed . Amblin Entertainment the film ’s producer and Universal Pictures its distributor said in a joint statement on Thursday night that it was in the “ best interest ” to cancel the premiere and press junket set for Saturday in Los Angeles . The statement said Amblin ’s review into the video was continuing . The movie starring Dennis Quaid will open in theaters nationwide on Jan. 27 as scheduled . “ Amblin and Universal do not want anything to overshadow this film that celebrates the relationship between animals and humans ” the statement said adding : “ Since the emergence of the footage Amblin has engaged with many associated with the production of the film including safety personnel trainers and stunt coordinators as part of their review . While we are all disheartened by the appearance of an animal in distress everyone has assured us that Hercules the German shepherd was not harmed throughout the filmmaking . ” In a statement on Wednesday Amblin and Universal said Hercules was “ happy and healthy . ” “ There were several days of rehearsal of the water scenes to ensure Hercules was comfortable with all of the stunts ” the statement continued . “ On the day of the shoot Hercules did not want to perform the stunt portrayed on the tape
2017.01.0"How much do Inaugural Addresses matter ? Many are memorable and continue to be quoted while most others are forgotten almost immediately . Donald J. Trump will get his chance shortly after noon Friday . “ They are a touching almost naïve attempt to set a tone for what is to come ” Jon Meacham the presidential biographer said . “ But as we know and as is often remarked events are in the saddle . We are not . ” Some of history ’s most notable inaugural speeches including the first of Abraham Lincoln in 1861 demonstrated that presidents cannot control the tides of history . But even so the most memorable ones stand as worthy introductions to the presidents who delivered them their values and their goals . George Washington | Thursday April 301789 The first Inaugural Address was characterized by the first president ’s impressive humility . Professing himself to feel unworthy of the task and praising God George Washington used the speech which James Madison helped him to draft
" Janet L. Yellen the Federal Reserve chairwoman made it clear Wednesday that she believes that the American economy is pretty much back on track . And that in turn sets the stage for a potential conflict with the incoming Trump administration in the months and years ahead . Congress assigns the Fed two goals : seek maximum employment and maintain stable prices . Ms. Yellen in a speech in San Francisco rather explicitly made clear that the nation isn ’t far from attaining those goals . “ Now it ’s fair to say the economy is near maximum employment and inflation is moving toward our goal ” she said . The unemployment rate 4. 7 percent is back near where it was before the 2008 recession . And “ although inflation has been running below our 2 percent objective for quite some time we have seen it start inching back toward 2 percent last year . ” It is Ms. Yellen ’s clearest indication to date that the era of extraordinary efforts by the central bank to get the economy back in shape is nearing its end . The Fed has raised interest rates in each of the last two Decembers and it is looking likely that there will be more than one rate increase this year . She said in her speech that she and her colleagues were expecting to increase the federal funds rate “ a few times a year . ” As central bankers are wont to do Ms. Yellen emphasized that those plans were contingent on the economy ’s behaving as the Fed expected . If inflation starts to slip again or improvements in the job market recede the Fed will presumably hold off . But she spoke clearly of the risks of moving too slowly toward the neutral interest rate that neither stimulates nor slows the economy . “ Waiting too long to begin moving toward the neutral rate could risk a nasty surprise down the road ” she said . “ Either too much inflation financial instability or both . ” But if things go as planned there is a clear risk that the Fed ’s goals could be on a collision course with the Trump administration ’s goals . The and his advisers have often spoken of seeking stronger economic growth than the United States has experienced the last several years
" He ’s sitting on a couch with his brothers presumably in the home in which he ’s now growing up . The photo has a graininess to it that is reminiscent of photos from the 1980 s but this picture is much more recent than that . It ’s the first visual I ’ve had of my former foster son since I hugged him goodbye . The boy we nicknamed “ BlueJay ” lived with us for almost a year when extended family members stepped forward to take custody of him and his two brothers back in March . In the series Foster Parent Diary I wrote about the experience of loving and losing him . Now I zoom in and out of this photo studying every blurry detail . I know he was 4 years old when the photo was taken the same age he was when he left our home but he looks so much older . I can see how his legs are longer his shoulders broader . His biological mother sent me the picture . She and I have remained in contact since he left . As far as I know it is the only photo she has received since her son went to live in a home several hours away from her . The updates she gets and passes along to me are sporadic and superficial . I ’m not sure even she really knows how he is doing . I dream about him . In my dreams he ’s always a little bit older with slightly more chiseled features . Sometimes he remembers me sometimes he doesn’t . Sometimes he runs into my arms sometimes he runs from them . On the days when he remembers me when I pull him in for a tight hug and he asks me where I ’ve been it feels so real that I wake up with an irrational hope that he had the same dream too . That maybe we ’d found a way to cross the distance between us just for a moment . My son Ryan who is now 6 years old recently asked me if we could call his former foster brother one day to talk to him
" “ In the Trumpian sense of the term she ’s the ultimate ‘ nasty woman . ’ An inspiration . Volcanic . When I start to write about her I always feel . ” The volcano referred to is Emily Dickinson as described by the contemporary poet Susan Howe in the catalog for an exhibition “ I ’m Nobody ! Who are you ? The Life and Poetry of Emily Dickinson ” opening on Friday at the Morgan Library Museum . The show is one of the largest gatherings ever of prime Dickinson relics and it comes with an aura the size of a city block . It instantly turns the Morgan into a pilgrimage site a literary Lourdes a place to come in contact with one aspect of American culture that truly can claim greatness which we sure can use in an political moment . The show has a mission : To give audiences a fresh take on Dickinson . Gone is the Puritan nun and that infantilized charmer the Belle of Amherst . At the Morgan we get a different Dickinson a person among people : a member of a household a a citizen . She was born in 1830 to rural gentry in Western Massachusetts and one of the earliest items in the show gives an impression of modest Yankee privilege . It ’s a portrait of Dickinson at around age 10 with her older brother Austin and young sister Lavinia done by a local artist
" WASHINGTON — Donald John Trump was inaugurated as the 45th president of the United States on Friday ushering in a new era that he vowed would shatter the established order and reverse a national decline that he called “ this American carnage . ” In a ceremony that capped a remarkable rise to power Mr. Trump presented himself as the leader of a populist uprising to restore lost greatness . He outlined a dark vision of an America afflicted by “ the ravages ” of economic dislocation and foreign exploitation requiring his approach to turn around . “ I will fight for you with every breath in my body and I will never ever let you down ” Mr. Trump told hundreds of thousands of admirers and onlookers in a forceful Inaugural Address from the West Front of the Capitol . “ America will start winning again winning like never before . We will bring back our jobs . We will bring back our borders . We will bring back our wealth . And we will bring back our dreams . ” Mr. Trump ’s ascension amounted to a hostile takeover of a capital facing its most significant disruption in generations . While officially a Republican he has taken on leaders of both parties and with no prior political career of his own made clear that he saw himself as the ultimate outsider not beholden to the current system . “ We will no longer accept politicians who are all talk and no action constantly complaining but never doing anything about it ” he said . “ The time for empty talk is over . Now arrives the hour of action . Do not allow anyone to tell you that it cannot be done . ” Mr. Trump ’s view of the United States was strikingly grim for an Inaugural Address — a country where mothers and children are “ trapped in poverty in our inner cities ” where “ factories ” are “ scattered like tombstones across the landscape ” and where drugs and crime “ have stolen too many lives . ” “ This American carnage ” he declared “ stops right here and stops right now . ” He got started right away with rolling back the policies of his predecessor former President Barack Obama by issuing orders freezing new regulations from recent weeks and ordering agencies to “ ease the burden ” of the Affordable Care Act during the transition from repealing to replacing the law . More orders are planned for next week . Wearing a dark suit and red tie and accompanied by his wife Melania in a suit and matching gloves
" WASHINGTON — America and the world just found out what “ America First ” means . President Trump could have used his inaugural address to define one of the touchstone phrases of his campaign in the most inclusive way arguing as did many of his predecessors that as the world ’s greatest superpower rises its partners will also prosper . Instead he chose a dark alternative one that appeared to herald the end of a American experiment to shape a world that would be eager to follow its lead . In Mr. Trump ’s vision America ’s new strategy is to win every transaction and confrontation . Gone are the days he said when America extended its defensive umbrella without compensation or spent billions to try to lift the fortune of foreign nations with no strategic benefits for the United States . “ From this day forward it ’s going to be only America first ” he said in a line that resonated around the world as soon as he uttered it from the steps of the Capitol . “ We must protect our borders from the ravages of other countries making our products stealing our companies and destroying our jobs . ” The United States he said

" In an interview with CNN on Wednesday night Thomas Barrack Jr . who heads the Presidential Inaugural Committee was asked whether Kanye West who vocally supported Donald J. Trump ’s candidacy last year and who visited him in Trump Tower in December following his victory would be performing at any of the inaugural events . “ We haven ’t asked him ” Mr. Barrack replied . Rather than stop there he continued : “ It ’s not the venue . The venue we have for entertainment is filled out . It ’s perfect . It ’s going to be typically and traditionally American . ” Following a political season in which quarrels over inclusion and exclusion in the United States — in senses literal metaphorical and philosophical — were central and heated the “ Make America Great Again ! Welcome Celebration ” was an opportunity to make a loud case . The stage was a potent one : the National Mall in Washington just beneath the Lincoln Memorial . The concert was broadcast live on CNN and online . What was presented as “ typically and traditionally American ” however veered between jingoism and vaudevillian fluff and largely ignored the contribution of to popular music ( which is to say almost all of popular music ) . Instead it focused heavily on country and rock by white Southerners including the country superstar Toby Keith who has been the nation ’s loudest musical cheerleader for a decade and a half the Mississippi band 3 Doors Down which was a favorite in the 2000 s and the Frontmen of Country an amalgam of singers made famous in other bands . It was a spotty lineup though not a wholly ineffective one . 3 Doors Down ’s songs remain sturdy and the frontman Brad Arnold ’s voice was strong though denuded of its sleazy edges . And Mr. Keith
" After eluding prosecution in the United States for decades and escaping from prison twice in Mexico the crime lord Joaquín Guzmán Loera better known as El Chapo appeared on Friday in federal court in Brooklyn and pleaded not guilty to charges that he had overseen a drug empire . Prosecutors said the operation had moved at least 200 tons of cocaine into the United States had earned $ 14 billion in profits and had been protected by an army of assassins who killed thousands of people . Mr. Guzmán ’s arraignment in Federal District Court was both a news media spectacle and a pro forma counterpoint to his sudden extradition from Mexico on Thursday afternoon when a police jet flew him from the border to MacArthur Airport in Islip on Long Island . The brief court proceeding took place under tight security with police vehicles heavily armed guards and dogs patrolling the grounds outside the courthouse . Dressed for his arraignment in a blue blue pajama pants and blue sneakers Mr. Guzmán 59 stood with his lawyers in front of Magistrate Judge James Orenstein in a courtroom packed with prosecutors federal agents and reporters . “ Are you Mr. Guzmán ? ” Judge Orenstein asked the defendant . “ Sí señor ” Mr. Guzmán said . The judge then asked Mr. Guzmán if he understood the charges he was facing . “ Sí señor ” he said again . Those charges had been detailed earlier on Friday at a news conference . At the briefing Robert L. Capers the United States attorney in Brooklyn
" The legal record shows that Jerry Hartfield ’s first murder conviction was thrown out on appeal and for the next 32 years he was not officially guilty of anything not sentenced to anything . Yet he spent that time in Texas prisons in what an appellate court now calls “ a criminal justice nightmare . ” He was finally tried and convicted again in 2015 but on Thursday Mr. Hartfield moved closer to freedom than he has been in decades . A state Court of Appeals ruled that he was not only denied his constitutional right to a speedy trial but to a degree the court had neither seen nor imagined before it noted that the important precedents dealt with delays of three years six years eight years — not 32 . The panel dismissed the indictment against Mr. Hartfield who is developmentally disabled in effect erasing the recent conviction . But it is still not clear whether or when he will get out of prison . Prosecutors could appeal Thursday ’s ruling to the Court of Criminal Appeals Texas ’ highest criminal tribunal . The state Attorney General ’s Office which has argued against Mr. Hartfield referred questions to the Matagorda County District Attorney ’s Office which did not reply to requests for comment . “ We are deeply mindful that our conclusion today means that a defendant who may be guilty of murder may go free ” Judge Gina M. Benavides wrote for the Court of Appeals . “ However based on the United States Constitution it is the only possible remedy . ” All told
" One night nearly 140 years ago Samuel Clemens told his young daughters Clara and Susie a bedtime story about a poor boy who eats a magic flower that gives him the ability to talk to animals . Storytelling was a nightly ritual in the Clemens home . But something about this particular tale must have stuck with Clemens better known as Mark Twain because he decided to jot down some notes about it . The story might have ended there lost to history . But decades later the scholar John Bird was searching the Twain archives at the University of California Berkeley when he came across the notes for the story which Twain titled “ Oleomargarine . ” Mr. Bird was astonished to find a richly imagined fable in Twain ’s inimitable voice . He and other scholars believe it may be the only written remnant of a children ’s fairy tale from Twain though he told his daughters stories constantly . It ’s impossible to know why Twain did not finish the tale or if he ever intended it for a wider audience . Now more than a century after Twain dreamed it up “ Oleomargarine ” has taken on a strange new afterlife . After consulting a few other scholars Mr. Bird brought the text to the attention of the Mark Twain House and Museum in Hartford which sold it to Doubleday Books for Young Readers . This fall Doubleday will release “ The Purloining of Prince Oleomargarine ” an expanded version of the story that was fleshed out and reimagined by the children ’s book team of Philip and Erin Stead . From Twain ’s spare the Steads created a illustrated story featuring talking animals giants dragons a kidnapped prince and a wicked king . While the original work has a timeless quality

The judge said that she knew of only one other pig that had been through the system Ms. Matteo recalled . The judge named the pig . Ms. Matteo immediately named the pig ’s owner . “ The judge was smiling at me ” Ms. Matteo said . The judge asked if there was an underground pig network in New York . “ I said ‘ More than you can imagine . ’ ” An untold number of pet pigs are scattered throughout the city despite a ban . They can be found in all five boroughs the veterinarians who treat them say . “ There are so so many of us ” said a neighbor of Ms. Matteo ’s who has two pigs and gave her name only as Leslie W. Ms. Matteo said she knew of dozens . Wilbur however a placid with a fondness for orange peppers and daylong naps is about to leave their ranks . Though the judge dismissed the violation last May accepting Ms. Matteo ’s explanation that Wilbur was an emotional support animal for her and her father the city ’s health department got the dismissal overturned . Ms. Matteo 46 must get rid of Wilbur by the end of the month . She has lined up a sanctuary in North Carolina for him but she is not ready to give him up . “ I ’m just praying that something gives between now and Jan. 31 ” she said on Monday as Wilbur grunted quietly beside her in her living room on Staten Island ’s South Shore .

" DAKAR Senegal — The political standoff in Gambia intensified on Thursday as foreign troops crossed the border with orders to dislodge a repressive leader who has refused to step down after losing a presidential election last month . Gambia ’s erratic leader Yahya Jammeh seized power in a coup 22 years ago and once said he could rule for a billion years . But on Thursday the Senegalese military headed toward the capital of Gambia Banjul where Mr. Jammeh has been holed up in the state house insisting that his rule is still valid . Mr. Jammeh has warned that he will fight back against any foreign military intervention . At least 26000 Gambians worried about violence have fled the country the United Nations says and several senior officials in Mr. Jammeh ’s government have resigned in protest or have left the nation as well . As the invasion began the winner of the election Adama Barrow was being sworn into office in a brief ceremony about 150 miles outside of Gambia . The inauguration took place in a nondescript room at the Gambian Embassy in Dakar Senegal because Mr. Barrow has so little control over his country that he did not go home for the funeral of his son who had been killed by a dog over the weekend . Mr. Barrow ’s team ultimately decided that the embassy in Dakar was the closest they could safely get to Gambian soil to start the new administration . Plans for an elaborate ceremony in a soccer stadium in Gambia ’s capital had to be scrapped amid the standoff . “ It ’s not necessarily the kind of ceremony to be jubilant about but the situation is dangerous ” said Halifa Sallah a spokesman for Mr. Barrow . But late on Thursday it appeared the situation could still be resolved without a fight . State television broadcast news that the presidents of Liberia
" RIO DE JANEIRO — The Supreme Court justice overseeing parts of the investigation into corruption at Brazil ’s national oil company died on Thursday in the crash of a small plane stunning the country as investigators are intensifying their efforts to prosecute an array of political figures on graft charges . The justice Teori Zavascki 68 was killed along with at least two other people traveling on a Beechcraft King Air C90 when it crashed into the Atlantic near Paraty a town of buildings on the coast between São Paulo and Rio de Janeiro according to Brazilian news reports . The cause of the crash was unknown as of Thursday night . The federal police have begun an investigation that will be closely watched across Brazil given Justice Zavascki ’s influence in Brazil ’s legal system . Justice Zavascki who had kept a low public profile since being named to the court in 2012 was responsible for some of the boldest moves in Brazil ’s judiciary in recent years earning him a reputation as a judge prepared to curb abuses by influential lawmakers and business leaders . In 2015 Justice Zavascki ordered the arrest and imprisonment of Delcídio do Amaral a sitting senator from the leftist Workers ’ Party which was in power at the time . And in 2016 he ousted the speaker of the lower house Eduardo Cunha who had orchestrated the impeachment of President Dilma Rousseff . Large portions of Brazil ’s political establishment are on edge over revelations of bribery by Odebrecht the construction giant that was one of the largest contractors for Petrobras the oil company . Justice Zavascki was overseeing the ratification of Odebrecht ’s plea deal in which dozens of Brazilian politicians are accused of receiving funds from the company and some prominent figures suggested that the plane crash could have been a result of foul play . “ This ‘ accident ’ needs to be thoroughly investigated
" Fifty years ago right about now two unassuming young brothers were standing in front of a CBS studio audience taping the first episode of their new variety show . They were also about to unleash the modern concept of television buzz in a storm the likes of which the medium had not seen . They were the Smothers Brothers Tom and Dick and the story of their show “ The Smothers Brothers Comedy Hour ” is worth recalling 50 years on as a case study that may prove newly relevant as a president with a habit of attacking TV shows via Twitter settles into office . That first episode taped in late January and broadcast Feb. 51967 wasn ’t incendiary but some that came later were spectacularly so . The brothers inflamed CBS censors and segments of their audience by injecting sexual innuendo drug references religion and especially politics into the typically bland format drawing in Season 3 a firing . The story of the show can seem . The brothers were delivering two things that every network today covets : a lot of attention and a young audience . Why kill that goose ? The answer lies in the newness of it all . In 1967 no one knew quite how to exploit controversy and conversation the way publicists do . The series was CBS ’s latest effort to compete against “ Bonanza ” the NBC staple that had owned Sunday nights for years . The brothers had a stage act in which Tom on guitar played a dimwit and Dick
" Geneticists tell us that somewhere between 1 and 5 percent of the genome of modern Europeans and Asians consists of DNA inherited from Neanderthals our prehistoric cousins . At Vanderbilt University John Anthony Capra an evolutionary genomics professor has been combining computation and a medical records databank to learn what a Neanderthal heritage — even a fractional one — might mean for people today . We spoke for two hours when Dr. Capra 35 recently passed through New York City . An edited and condensed version of the conversation follows . Q. Let ’s begin with an indiscreet question . How did contemporary people come to have Neanderthal DNA on their genomes ? A. We hypothesize that roughly 50000 years ago when the ancestors of modern humans migrated out of Africa and into Eurasia they encountered Neanderthals . Matings must have occurred then . And later . One reason we deduce this is because the descendants of those who remained in Africa — present day Africans — don ’t have Neanderthal DNA . What does that mean for people who have it ? At my lab we ’ve been doing genetic testing on the blood samples of 28000 patients at Vanderbilt and eight other medical centers across the country . Computers help us pinpoint where on the human genome this Neanderthal DNA is and we run that against information from the patients ’ anonymized medical records . We ’re looking for associations . What we ’ve been finding is that Neanderthal DNA has a subtle influence on risk for disease . It affects our immune system and how we respond to different immune challenges . It affects our skin . You ’re slightly more prone to a condition where you can get scaly lesions after extreme sun exposure . There ’s an increased risk for blood clots and tobacco addiction . To our surprise it appears that some Neanderthal DNA can increase the risk for depression however there are other Neanderthal bits that decrease the risk . Roughly 1 to 2 percent of one ’s risk for depression is determined by Neanderthal DNA . It all depends on where on the genome it ’s located . Was there ever an upside to having Neanderthal DNA ? It probably helped our ancestors survive in prehistoric Europe . When humans migrated into Eurasia they encountered unfamiliar hazards and pathogens . By mating with Neanderthals they gave their offspring needed defenses and immunities . That trait for blood clotting helped wounds close up quickly . In the modern world however this trait means greater risk for stroke and pregnancy complications . What helped us then doesn ’t necessarily now . Did you say earlier that Neanderthal DNA increases susceptibility to nicotine addiction ? Yes . Neanderthal DNA can mean you ’re more likely to get hooked on nicotine even though there were no tobacco plants in archaic Europe . We think this might be because there ’s a bit of Neanderthal DNA right next to a human gene that ’s a neurotransmitter implicated in a generalized risk for addiction . In this case and probably others we think the Neanderthal bits on the genome may serve as switches that turn human genes on or off . Aside from the Neanderthals
" • Hundreds of thousands of women gathered in Washington on Saturday in a kind of counterinauguration after President Trump took office on Friday . A range of speakers and performers cutting across generational lines rallied near the Capitol before marchers made their way toward the White House . • They were joined by crowds in cities across the country : In Chicago the size of a rally so quickly outgrew early estimates that the march that was to follow was canceled for safety . In Manhattan Fifth Avenue became a river of pink hats while in downtown Los Angeles even before the gathering crowd stretched itself out to march it was more than a quarter mile deep on several streets . • Begun as a Facebook post just after the election the march is the start of what organizers hope could be a sustained campaign of protest in a polarized America unifying demonstrators around issues like reproductive rights immigration and civil rights . The movement has also encountered divisions . • The Times had journalists covering the marches in Washington New York Boston Atlanta Denver Los Angeles Phoenix St. Paul and Key West Fla . Check out what they posted on Twitter and what readers asked of them live . See photos from marches around the world too . ( All times listed below are local . ) ( Or watch video of the whole event . ) • The singer and actress Janelle Monae highlighted the issue of police violence leading the crowd in a chant of “ Sandra Bland ! Say her name ! ” a reference to the case where a black woman died in police custody in Texas after being arrested in 2015 . She then brought the microphone to each of the women in “ Mothers of the Movement ” who had joined her onstage . One by one they joined in the chant each inserting the name of her child who had died at the hands of the police . • The actress Ashley Judd delivered an uninhibited speech that ended with her referencing how Mr. Trump bragged in a 2005 recording that he could use his celebrity status to force himself on women even groping their private parts . They “ ain ’t for grabbing ” she said . “ They are for birthing new generations of filthy vulgar nasty proud
" “ One of the great weapons of a democracy . ” This was how Harry Belafonte the performer and civil rights activist referred to the street march in a recent interview . Mr. Belafonte played a critical role in organizing the 1963 March on Washington which helped spur the passage of two major civil rights bills . He is also a of the women ’s march set for Saturday . When thousands of women converge on Washington this weekend they will join a long tradition of rallies in the capital . From the suffrage processions of the early 20th century to the Tea Party rallies of 2009 marches have drawn attention to crucial issues occasionally resulted in violence and often prompted opposing gatherings . Marian B. Mollin an associate professor at Virginia Tech who studies the history of social movements said successful marches had capitalized on symbolism and street theater attracted a broad coalition and pushed clear policy goals . But the test of a march ’s efficacy she said is whether it energizes participants long after they ’ve gone home sustaining them through the less exciting aspects of change . This is what she ’ll be watching for in the months after Saturday ’s march . “ Are they continuing to be fired up when they get back ? Because there is a lot of unfun unglamorous work to do ” she said . We took a look back at several marches in Washington and how they changed — or didn ’t change — history . On March 31913 a named Inez Milholland slipped on her white kid boots threw a cape around her shoulders and climbed onto a borrowed horse to help lead what was then the largest women ’s march in American history . Behind her came businesswomen in blue writers in white artists in pink and musicians in red all calling for their right to vote . Five thousand women marched while some onlookers hurled insults and tripped them . “ If my wife were where you are
1.0"SOFIA Bulgaria — The inaugural meeting of the European Trump Society packed the central aisle of a bookstore in Bulgaria ’s capital Sofia on Friday evening — women in furs men in ski jackets the floor glistening with melted snow . A live feed from the crowded steps of the United States Capitol filled a projection screen on the back wall . “ The election of Mr. Trump means ‘ You ’re fired ! ’ to the political elites in America and the world ” declared Boris Angelov a tabloid editor and a founder of the society which is strictly Bulgarian at the moment but has wider aspirations . Ilia Lingorski a former deputy finance minister shouted from the crowd “ Bulgaria desperately needs its own Trump movement . ” The inauguration of Donald J. Trump as America ’s 45th president with declarations of “ America first ” was met with alarm in many corners of the world . But not everywhere . Pockets of celebration broke out here and there in places where Mr. Trump ’s nationalist message matched local stirrings and his promise of friendlier relations with President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia and a harsher approach to Islamic terrorism were eagerly embraced . About 100 Trump supporters gathered around a statue of President Ronald Reagan in Budapest ’s Freedom Square for a “ Better World Order Inauguration Party . ” The speaker was Zsolt Bayer a prominent pundit who once referred to Jews as “ stinking excrement . ” Standing beneath a banner reading “ Hungarian Deplorables for Trump ” he called on President Trump to combat political correctness which Mr. Bayer said had created a world in which “ only the white
2017.01.0"WASHINGTON — Hours after President Trump took his oath on Friday the Justice Department issued an opinion saying that his appointment of his Jared Kushner as a senior White House adviser would be lawful despite a federal antinepotism law . In a opinion signed on Friday a longtime career lawyer in the Justice Department ’s Office of Legal Counsel said that the president ’s special hiring authority exempted White House positions from a 1967 law barring the president from employing relatives at a federal agency . Some legal experts had raised concerns that Mr. Kushner ’s appointment violated that law which Congress enacted several years after President John F. Kennedy had appointed his brother Robert as attorney general . But the new Justice Department opinion signed by Daniel L. Koffsky a deputy assistant attorney general in the legal counsel office said Mr. Trump had the power to appoint Mr. Kushner anyway because of a subsequent 1978 law that gives the president the authority to appoint White House staff members without regard to other laws restricting employment and compensation of federal employees . Mr. Koffsky ’s opinion acknowledged that in several cases since 1978 the Office of Legal Counsel had determined that the antinepotism statute prevented presidents from appointing relatives to positions . “ Although our conclusion today departs from some of that prior work we think that this departure is fully justified ” he wrote . The revised position came after an effort by Jamie S. Gorelick Mr. Kushner ’s lawyer and a deputy attorney general during the Clinton administration who is now a lawyer at the firm WilmerHale to clear away obstacles to Mr. Kushner ’s appointment . The opinion paves the way for Mr. Kushner 35 to join Mr. Trump in the West Wing . Among the new president ’s closest advisers during the campaign Mr. Kushner married Mr. Trump ’s daughter Ivanka in 2009 . He has run his family ’s vast real estate company and has owned a newspaper The New York Observer . Mr. Trump announced on Jan. 9 that he would appoint Mr. Kushner who will not accept a salary . His purview is expected to include the Middle East and Israel
" WASHINGTON — One topic has dominated conversations among elected Republicans since President Trump ’s stunning victory : Will he actually pursue his campaign agenda of nationalism all but obliterating the distinctions that have defined America ’s political parties for a century ? While some of his advisers suggested that he would slip back into a more conventional Republican approach Mr. Trump dropped hints in interviews Twitter posts and other public comments that he intended to push his party away from its internationalist dogma on trade foreign alliances immigration infrastructure spending and prescription drug access . The hints are over . An inaugural speech delivered with the same blunt force that propelled Mr. Trump ’s insurgent campaign has dashed Republican hopes for a more traditional agenda . With his “ new decree ” he declared himself modern America ’s first populist president — and all but dared his own party to resist his Republican reformation . “ Every decision on trade on taxes on immigration on foreign affairs will be made to benefit American workers and American families ” he said . Mr. Trump ’s vision will inevitably collide with establishment Republican leaders in Congress and the outcome could determine not just the success of Mr. Trump ’s presidency but also the identity of his party . Republicans have resisted Democratic efforts to spend big on the nation ’s roads bridges tunnels and rail lines use the federal government ’s power to bargain for lower prescription drug prices block trade agreements and limit foreign interventions . Republican leaders have sought a approach on immigration laws offering a pathway to citizenship for illegal immigrants and tried to restrain popular programs like Social Security and Medicare . If the president is able to blur party lines on such issues and harness an ascendant coalition to win that clash he will have untethered conservatism from the Republican Party and shifted the party away from the approach that has been its hallmark since Ronald Reagan stood 36 years ago in the same position on the Capitol steps as Mr. Trump . But Mr. Trump is about to discover that his hopes for a realignment may not come easily . As in his campaign he faces an array of obstacles : his historic unpopularity and lack of discipline advisers who hope to nudge him back toward conventional Republicanism and
" WASHINGTON — President Trump plans to take executive action on a nearly daily basis for a month to unravel his predecessor ’s legacy and begin enacting his own agenda his aides say part of an extended exercise of presidential power to quickly make good on his campaign promises . But in a reflection of the improvisational style that helped fuel his rise he has made few if any firm decisions about which orders he wants to make or in which order . That is a striking break from past presidents who have entered office with detailed plans for rolling out a series of executive actions that set a tone for their presidencies and send a clear message about their agendas . It was plain that Mr. Trump had devised no such strategy by his first day in office as advisers expressed doubt until the last moments about whether he would issue any directives on Friday . “ It ’s going to be a decision ” Sean Spicer the White House press secretary told reporters that afternoon . Then around 7 p. m. reporters were suddenly summoned to the Oval Office . After sprinting from the briefing room they watched Mr. Trump sign a directive to federal agencies to begin scaling back parts of the Affordable Care Act . “ There are a number that are being looked at but it ’s just a question of which ones he feels like doing and when ” Mr. Spicer had said of executive orders earlier on Friday . In recent days he had said that Mr. Trump ’s top aides were still deciding on the “ sequencing ” of the unilateral actions . Still there is little doubt about the policy areas in Mr. Trump ’s sights : international trade deals illegal immigration the fight against the Islamic State
" WASHINGTON — In the end she checked every box . Elegant unexpected dress ? Check . Unknown designer elevated to overnight sensation ? Check . New York brand ? Check . Implicit message about cooperation and embracing the melting pot ? Check . When Melania Trump took the stage with her husband President Trump on Friday night for the inaugural balls she demonstrated that while she may have been out of the spotlight since the election she hasn ’t been sticking her head in the sand . She has been closely studying the vernacular of first lady dress . In an architectural white crepe column with a thin burgundy ribbon as a belt a high slit and a gazar wave curving from sleeve to hip and then down the skirt she looked — especially when compared with the younger generation of Trump women most of whom opted for sparkling princess gowns — understated and adult . Not remotely mired in the 1980 s though her husband ’s look and rhetoric may be . And despite rampant speculation about the designer behind the dress she cannily managed to surprise the entire fashion world . The gown was according to a statement from her office a “ collaboration ” between Mrs. Trump and the designer Hervé Pierre a Frenchman who moved to New York in the early 1990 s and eventually became creative director of Carolina Herrera where he and Mrs. Trump met and where he worked on clothes for Laura Bush and Michelle Obama though largely behind the scenes . He left that post last February . This is his first major dress under his own name ( he does not yet have a collection in that context ) . It will eventually join the exhibit of first ladies gowns at the Smithsonian stretching back to Helen Taft in 1909 . Though rumors had surfaced earlier in the week that Mrs. Trump was working with Chanel ’s creative director Karl Lagerfeld on her gown in the end she used the opportunity — and indeed her entire inaugural wardrobe — to do what her husband standing on the steps of the Capitol building
" WASHINGTON — The glorious Lincoln Memorial was closed on Inauguration Day leaving its white marble inhabitant to inspire from a distance . The monument had served as a backdrop for an inaugural concert the night before and now in the late morning construction workers were methodically removing the silvery bars of scaffolding that imprisoned it . Even so its sole resident could still be seen behind the Doric columns his gaze trained on the domed Capitol where a peaceful transfer of power was about to take place . And people still came to be in his presence some to remind themselves that a country riven by dissent can come together . It has before . No matter that the sky was as gray as the Potomac or that the cold air felt like a wet sweater . Here they were from the North and South East and West in red Trump hats and blue Hillary jubilant distressed feeling a part and apart . They stood in admiration of Lincoln as workers tore down and cleaned up including a man collecting debris with a picker his dog tag laced securely into one of his boots .

" WASHINGTON — A spate of violence erupted on Friday in the nation ’s capital as protesters damaged storefronts threw rocks and bricks at police officers and lit a limousine on fire . Phalanxes of police officers used pepper spray flash grenades and other nonlethal tools to disperse the protesters . By the end of the day six police officers had sustained minor injuries and more than 200 people had been arrested . Many of the protesters were dressed in black wore face masks and carried flags associated with groups . They congregated on a series of streets just blocks from the parade where Donald J. Trump passed as he made his way to the White House for the first time as president their activities creating a distraction as television networks played live footage of the clashes . The violence was focused not only on the police . Richard B. Spencer a leader of the a fringe movement that embraces white nationalism and a range of racist and positions was punched in the face by a protester as Mr. Spencer gave an interview on the street according to a video posted on Twitter . “ We ’re not peaceful ” said one of the masked protesters who like many others who clashed with the police ran away after being approached by reporters . While the clashes occurred thousands of peaceful protesters marched across the country as they voiced slogans . In New York seven people were arrested when they blocked the sidewalk outside Trump Tower . Protesters in San Francisco formed a blockade across train tracks leading to eight arrests and chained themselves to the downtown offices of Uber and Wells Fargo . In the central business district of Portland Ore . banks clothing retailers and a jewelry store boarded up windows and covered walls to limit vandalism . Chants in English and Spanish broke out in front of the Capitol in Phoenix . “ This is one of the darkest days in the history of our country ” said Adelle Wallace
" BEIRUT Lebanon — Russia signed a agreement on Friday to greatly enlarge its military presence in Syria more than doubling the space for warships in Russia ’s only Mediterranean port and securing rights to an air base that may already be adding a second runway . The agreement covers the port in Tartus and an air base near Latakia which have been pivotal in Russian assistance to President Bashar of Syria in fighting an array of insurgents . It ensures Russia ’s ability to deploy forces in Syria for the next and perhaps beyond . News of the agreement came as Mr. Assad received what appeared to be another positive development : A Turkish official suggested publicly for the first time that Turkey would accept a peace deal in Syria ’s war that would allow Mr. Assad to stay in power . The remarks by the official Deputy Prime Minister Mehmet Simsek at the World Economic Forum in Davos Switzerland indicated that Turkey — Syria ’s northern neighbor and one of Mr. Assad ’s most implacable foes — had softened its position in the interest of finding a solution . While Turkey ’s government later said that Mr. Simsek ’s remarks had been misconstrued it was clear that he had said a settlement without Mr. Assad would be “ not you know realistic . ” Both developments came as Russia Turkey and Iran prepared to convene Syrian peace talks in Astana the capital of Kazakhstan on Monday . For the first time it looked likely that the main Syrian opposition along with many other factions would sit down with Mr. Assad ’s government for peace talks . The last effort at such negotiations was held by the United Nations in Geneva in February and it collapsed in days . The new Russian military agreement with Syria provides for an expansion of Russia ’s Tartus naval base on the Syrian coast under a lease that could automatically renew for a further 25 years according to Tass the Russian news agency . Tass said the expansion would provide simultaneous berthing for up to 11 warships including vessels
" Islamic State militants have destroyed the facade of a Roman theater and another ancient monument in the historic city of Palmyra Syria the Syrian news agency reported on Friday . The news agency SANA said the Islamic State also known as ISIS or ISIL had destroyed part of the theater and severely damaged a tetrapylon a square structure of four plinths each with four columns . The agency said the tetrapylon had two columns still standing and appeared to have been “ intentionally destroyed using explosives . ” The smashing of the ancient structures was a further attempt by the group to impose its will by destroying monuments or artifacts that it says do not conform to its strict interpretation of Islam . The group ’s demolition of historic sites in Iraq Libya Syria and elsewhere has drawn international opprobrium Unesco has branded the actions “ cultural cleansing . ” The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights a monitoring group based in Britain said the destruction of the two sites in Palmyra appeared to have taken place on Jan. 11 . The observatory said the acts could have been a demonstration of force before the militant group which is under siege in Iraq and in Syria retreats from the city . The Islamic State retook Palmyra in December nine months after Syrian government forces backed by Russia pushed the group out . The militant group had terrorized citizens and destroyed numerous priceless remains in the desert city declared a World Heritage site by Unesco . The targeting of Palmyra ’s cultural treasures has particular resonance as the city ’s heritage which embodies Greek
" Turkey ’s Parliament approved a proposed Constitution on Saturday that would cede even greater powers to the country ’s president if endorsed in a national referendum but the bitterly contested voting process was marred by screaming matches and physical altercations that sent at least three legislators to a hospital . The low point came when supporters of the governing Justice and Development Party in an apparent attack on the floor of Parliament on Thursday knocked off the artificial arm of the opposition politician Safak Pavey . A former United Nations diplomat Ms. Pavey suffered injuries to the socket of her arm when the prosthesis was dislocated . She had lost an arm and a leg in a train accident years ago . Lawmakers have been debating the proposed Constitution since Jan. 9 and over the past week they have engaged in a protracted round of voting on each of the 18 articles in the document often debating until the early hours — finishing at 3:15 a. m. Friday for instance . The final vote on the Constitution took place early Saturday The Associated Press reported . The final draft will be put to a national referendum . The president Recep Tayyip Erdogan forged an alliance between followers of his party and the Nationalist Movement Party or M. H. P. in an effort to gain enough votes to pass the new Constitution . He succeeded despite bitter criticism by opposition parties and the Peoples ’ Democratic Party or H. D. P. Many of H. D. P. ’s legislators — including its — have been jailed by Mr. Erdogan ’s government on terrorism charges . The proposed Constitution comes during a period of emergency rule also approved by Parliament in the wake of the failed coup attempt in July against Mr. Erdogan . Since then he has ordered the dismissal of 100000 state employees and the jailing of more than 40000 others suspected of supporting the coup . He has also cracked down on the independent news media jailing about 140 journalists in the past year with at least 81 still in prison last month
" IN my spare time when not writing about consumer technology for The New York Times I have a sideline renting out a cabin on Airbnb . So when Jose reserved the property last October it was nothing unusual . He said he wanted to host some relatives for a quiet weekend in the mountains . I welcomed him without hesitation . That Saturday my neighbors texted me as they watched caterers carry large white pillars and bouquets into the backyard . Then 10 cars surrounded the front yard and dozens of people wearing suits and dresses poured into the house . It became clear this was no intimate . For a day my Airbnb rental was turned into a wedding venue which broke city laws . My business would be in jeopardy if the police were notified . Such is life as an Airbnb “ Superhost . ” Since buying my cabin in Northern California in late 2015 I have hosted about 30 groups and become part of the booming ecosystem for Airbnb the online reservation marketplace that lets people turn their homes into vacation rentals . With more than 140 million guest arrivals to date Airbnb has proved a boon for hosts and an attractive option for travelers looking to avoid hefty fees from hotels . In the process I have been named a Superhost which means I have hosted many guests and consistently received reviews . It ’s a small group — researchers say only about 7 percent of hosts are Superhosts . In exchange I get more visibility in search results invitations from the company to exclusive events and a medal next to my profile photo . The designation as a Superhost has paid off : My house is a few bookings away from netting a profit . Yet vaulting to Superhost status is hardly intuitive and I learned hard lessons along the way . Here are some tips on running a successful ( and lucrative ) Airbnb rental based on interviews with Superhosts and my experience . People who rent your house on Airbnb are choosing it over a hotel . So you had better be as hospitable friendly and communicative as a hotel . For your rental that means a few things . Provide staples like cooking equipment cable TV soap for bathing and cleaning towels toothpaste and toilet paper . Your house should work as advertised — faulty appliances should be repaired or replaced . For another

But there is one topic they are happy to gush about : their mother Tina Knowles Lawson . In the January issue of Interview magazine Solange is interviewed by Beyoncé and waxes lyrical about how their mother “ always taught us to be in control of our voice and our bodies and our work . ” Last June when accepting the fashion icon award from the Council of Fashion Designers of America Beyoncé dedicated it to her “ fabulous and beautiful ” mother . And in November when Solange appeared on “ Saturday Night Live ” a backstage video posted on Instagram showing the singer carried by Mom and Big Sis caused the internet to let out a collective “ aww . ” Ms. Lawson 63 now finds herself in a newfound role as an artistic bridge between two of 2016 ’s most critically lauded albums : “ Lemonade ” Beyoncé ’s fiery visual album that is up for nine nods at the Grammy Awards next month and “ A Seat at the Table ” Solange ’s spare and poetic RB record which topped Pitchfork ’s list last year .

" DETROIT — A low buzz fills the air as an army of mortgage bankers perched below floating canopies in a kaleidoscope of vivid pinks blues purples and greens works the phones promising borrowers easy financing and low rates for home loans . By the elevators nobody blinks when an employee wearing a pink tutu bustles past . On any given day a company mascot Simon a bespectacled mouse goes on the hunt for “ gouda ” or good ideas from the work force . A visit to the headquarters of Quicken Loans in downtown Detroit may seem like a trip to a place where “ Glengarry Glen Ross ” meets Seussville . But the whimsical irreverent atmosphere sits atop a business in a field — the selling of the American dream — that has changed drastically since an earlier generation of mortgage lenders propelled the economy to near collapse in 2008 by issuing risky and even fraudulent loans . In the years since the crisis many of the nation ’s largest banks pulled back their activities . Quicken Loans pushed in . Today it is the retail mortgage lender originating $ 96 billion in mortgages last year — an eightfold increase from 2008 . Privately held Quicken like some of America ’s largest banks before it has also landed in regulators ’ cross hairs . In a federal lawsuit filed in 2015 the Department of Justice charged that
" Only a few years ago the dream of harnessing the strong steady gusts off the Atlantic coast to make electricity seemed destined to remain just that . Proposals for offshore wind farms foundered on the shoals of high costs regulatory hurdles and the fierce opposition of those who didn ’t want giant industrial machinery puncturing the pristine ocean views . Now the industry is poised to take off just as the American political landscape and energy policy itself face perhaps the greatest uncertainty in a generation . Last fall five turbines in the waters of Rhode Island — the country ’s first offshore farm — began delivering power to the grid . European energy developers like Statoil and Dong Energy are making big investments to bring projects to American waters . Last year in Massachusetts Gov. Charlie Baker a Republican signed into law a mandate that is pushing development forward . And in New York after years of stymied progress the Long Island Power Authority has reached an agreement with Deepwater Wind which built the Rhode Island turbine array to drop a much larger farm — 15 turbines capable of running 50000 average homes — into the ocean about 35 miles from Montauk . If approved by the utility board on Wednesday the $ 1 billion installation could become the first of several in a parcel with room for as many as 200 turbines that Deepwater is leasing from the federal government . “ We ’re developing this first offshore wind project in federal waters but it ’s really a gateway project to other locations around Long Island ” said Thomas Falcone the power authority ’s chief executive . “ We ’re now at a point where developers can build projects at prices where utilities are willing buyers
" ISLAMABAD Pakistan — A bombing killed at least 20 people on Saturday during an auction at a vegetable market in a mostly Shiite town in northwestern Pakistan ending a long lull in militant violence there officials said . At least 43 people were wounded in the morning bombing in Parachinar capital of the Kurram tribal region which borders Afghanistan . The Pakistani Taliban claimed responsibility for the attack . “ I was in my shop when a deafening blast shook the market ” a Parachinar resident Hussain Ali Tori said by telephone . “ I have seen dozens of shattered bodies lying on the ground . Some were dead and many were crying for help . ” A Taliban spokesman Muhammad Khurasani said a suicide bomber had carried out the attack but a Kurram official Nasrullah Khan said the bomb appeared to have been planted in a crate . “ The place is always crowded ” said Mr. Khan a deputy administrator . Parachinar has been a center of resistance to the Taliban specifically the Haqqani network which is one of the movement ’s most violent factions and it has been the site of numerous bombings in the past . But there had been none since December 2015 when another market bombing killed 23 people . On Saturday
" SAN FRANCISCO — By mastering some tough computer chip technology and then pulling off an audacious business strategy based on selling its smartphone knowledge Qualcomm has made billions of dollars and seized influence in the tech industry . Some days that is a real drag . On Friday Apple its longtime partner sued Qualcomm over what it said was $ 1 billion in withheld rebates . In the lawsuit filed in Federal District Court for the Southern District of California in San Diego Apple said the money had been promised in conjunction with an agreement not to buy chips from other suppliers or to divulge Qualcomm ’s intellectual property licensing practices . The suit seeks the rebates among other things . Apple sued three days after the Federal Trade Commission accused Qualcomm of using anticompetitive practices to guarantee its high royalty payments for advanced wireless technology . The commission cited Qualcomm ’s deals with Taiwanese companies that manufacture Apple iPhones over semiconductors it sells for the iPhone . In its complaint the commission described Qualcomm as “ the world ’s dominant supplier ” of semiconductors that manage smartphone communications . The commission said Qualcomm had obtained “ elevated royalties ” for its patented intellectual property on wireless communications . Other smartphone chip makers have to pay Qualcomm for that intellectual property too . The commission and Apple complaints follow several other problems including a $ 975 million fine by Chinese regulators in 2015 and activist shareholder complaints later that year that forced layoffs at Qualcomm . Last month Qualcomm was fined $ 850 million in South Korea for unfair patent licensing . When Apple provided information to South Korean regulators in that case and sought competing chips from Intel Qualcomm refused to pay Apple its promised money Apple said . Qualcomm has vowed to fight the South Korean charge and the F. T. C. suit . “ Apple has intentionally mischaracterized our agreements and negotiations ” Qualcomm said in a statement adding that it would fight that lawsuit too . Few expect Qualcomm to back down . It was shaped by its founders to be brainy combative and profitable . “ They are seasoned
1.0"“Beaches ” directed by Garry Marshall and released three decades ago was a curio even in its own time : a pastiche of 1950 s that was set strangely and uncomfortably in the 1970 s and ’80s . Portraying the lifelong friendship of two women one of whom dies too young — you could say that ’s a spoiler but it ’s really the only thing the movie ’s about — it was a shamelessly retrograde and soap opera with a veneer of fake feminism . ( Careers and single motherhood were fine as long as they involved constant suffering . ) Depending on your susceptibilities it could inspire cultish devotion or impel you to yell at the screen . It was not by any measure a movie that needed to be remade . But here we are 29 years later with a new television version of “ Beaches ” on Lifetime on Saturday night . Idina Menzel has taken the Bette Midler role of C. C. Bloom the brassy Jewish ( originally from the Bronx now from Venice Beach ) and Nia Long succeeds Barbara Hershey as Hillary Whitney who originally was a lawyer . The Lifetime “ Beaches ” is a reduction of the original — smaller emotions smaller performances fewer songs shorter running time ( about 87 minutes versus 123 ) — and while that could have been an improvement it ’s not . The things that made the original worth sitting through
" WASHINGTON — President Trump used his first full day in office on Saturday to unleash a remarkably bitter attack on the news media falsely accusing journalists of both inventing a rift between him and intelligence agencies and deliberately understating the size of his inauguration crowd . In a visit to the Central Intelligence Agency intended to showcase his support for the intelligence community Mr. Trump ignored his own repeated public statements criticizing the intelligence community a group he compared to Nazis just over a week ago . He also called journalists “ among the most dishonest human beings on earth ” and he said that up to 1. 5 million people had attended his inauguration a claim that photographs disproved . Later at the White House he dispatched Sean Spicer the press secretary to the briefing room in the West Wing where Mr. Spicer scolded reporters and made a series of false statements . He said news organizations had deliberately misstated the size of the crowd at Mr. Trump ’s inauguration on Friday in an attempt to sow divisions at a time when Mr. Trump was trying to unify the country warning that the new administration would hold them to account . The statements from the new president and his spokesman came as hundreds of thousands of people protested against Mr. Trump a crowd that appeared to dwarf the one that gathered the day before when he was sworn in . It was a striking display of invective and grievance at the dawn of a presidency usually a time when the White House works to set a tone of national unity and to build confidence in a new leader . Instead the president and his team appeared embattled and defensive signaling that the pugnacious style Mr. Trump employed as a candidate will persist now that he has ascended to the nation ’s highest office . Saturday was supposed to be a day for Mr. Trump to mend fences with the intelligence community with an appearance at the C. I. A. ’s headquarters in Langley Va . While he was lavish in his praise the president focused in his speech on his complaints about news coverage of his criticism of the nation ’s spy agencies and meandered to other topics
" WASHINGTON — Senate Republicans will move this week to speed the confirmation of President Trump ’s cabinet an effort that has been stymied by the combination of lax preparation by Mr. Trump ’s transition team his many unorthodox nominees and Democrats spoiling for a fight albeit with few cards in their deck . On Monday the Senate will vote on the confirmation of Representative Mike Pompeo of Kansas to lead the Central Intelligence Agency after Democrats used one of the few procedural maneuvers left to them to force a debate on his inevitable approval . Republicans had hoped to push through Mr. Pompeo and others last Friday but were able to confirm only two : James N. Mattis for defense secretary and John F. Kelly to lead homeland security . President Obama had seven nominees approved on his first day in office . Also on Monday the Senate Foreign Relations Committee will vote on Mr. Trump ’s pick for secretary of state Rex W. Tillerson whose road to confirmation has been bumpy . Mr. Tillerson received a lift on Sunday when two Republicans Senator John McCain of Arizona and Senator Lindsey Graham of South Carolina said they would support him after weeks of public hedging . Mr. Tillerson the former chief executive of Exxon Mobil has drawn scrutiny over his business connections with Russia and his personal relationship with President Vladimir V. Putin . Senator Marco Rubio Republican of Florida has hinted that he might join Democrats in rejecting Mr. Tillerson which would lead to the unusual spectacle of a nominee facing the full Senate without a positive recommendation from the committee that held his confirmation hearing . Other nominees have been impeded by attempts to untangle their conflicts of interest a process that Mr. Trump ’s transition team started far later than its predecessors and that has led to embarrassing revelations . A committee vote for Betsy DeVos a billionaire who is Mr. Trump ’s nominee for education secretary has been delayed by a week to give senators more time to review her voluminous ethics paperwork
" Joanne Fitzgerald was getting divorced and was stressed out . When stomach pain kicked in she saw a doctor to have it checked out . That was her mistake . The doctor diagnosed a mild form of gastritis an inflammation of the stomach lining and recommended some medicine . But when the divorce became final in 2008 she lost health coverage from her husband ’s employer and insurer after insurer refused to cover her because of the condition . She was finally offered a policy that excluded coverage for anything related to her gastrointestinal tract . “ I thought I was being smart in going to the doctor and getting checked out ” Ms. Fitzgerald 55 who currently lives in Washington D. C. said recently . “ Then I tried to go get insurance and everyone denied me . ” Her fortunes changed under the Affordable Care Act the major health law signed by President Barack Obama that required insurers to cover medical conditions . She was one of the millions of people who jumped at the opportunity and bought a policy available under the new law . Now after President Trump and the Congress have vowed to repeal and replace the health law one of the most vexing questions is whether people like Ms. Fitzgerald will be covered . About 27 percent of people under 65 are thought to have some sort of condition that will most likely leave them without individual insurance if the law is repealed according to a recent study . The guarantee of coverage has already become a rallying cry for people who want to keep the law . The issue “ is the third rail ” for the Republicans said Michael Turpin a longtime health industry executive . Before the law a fairly typical life event — like a divorce or the loss of a job — and a relatively minor medical condition could upend a person ’s health coverage options . Stories of sick people unable to get coverage when they needed it most were legion . Mr. Trump insists he wants to keep the requirement for insurers and other top Republicans say people who want coverage should not be turned away . Details about how they will cover people with existing medical conditions have not yet emerged but many lawmakers have started pushing an idea — known as pools — that left many people uncovered or with strict limits to their coverage in the past . The challenge for lawmakers is this : How do you get insurers to cover people who will definitely need costly medical care — and do so without making insurance too expensive for everyone ? The Affordable Care Act addresses that question by requiring everyone to get coverage or face a tax penalty . That mandate is meant to increase the number of healthy people who have insurance distributing the costs of caring for those who are sick across a wider population . The thinking is that if enough healthy people sign up
" Donald J. Trump ran on a campaign promise to dismantle the Affordable Care Act . So it should not come as a surprise that he has signed an executive order urging his administration to fight it as much as possible . But that order alone won ’t allow President Trump to unwind the sprawling health law known as Obamacare . Mr. Trump and Republican leaders in Congress are engaged in negotiations about legislation that might substantially undo or replace the health law . Even before the inauguration Congress took a first step toward gutting major provisions . But as that process underscores major changes to health policy will require new legislation . The Trump executive order should be seen more as a mission statement and less as a monarchical edict that can instantly change the law . Mr. Trump has sent a strong signal that he intends to fight the health law but he sent signals that were strong on the campaign trail too just in less legalistic language . And the order crucially notes that agencies can act only “ to the maximum extent permitted by law . ” ( How the Trump administration interprets those permissions of course is yet untested . ) The order spells out the various ways that a Trump administration might fight the parts of the health law until new legislation comes : by writing new regulations and exercising discretion where allowed . Regulations can be changed but as the order notes only through a legal process of “ notice and comment ” that can take months or years . On matters of discretion the administration can move faster but there are limited places where current law gives the administration much power to quickly change course . How much of the order is bluster and how much it signals a set of significant policy changes in the pipeline is unclear . The order was not specific and did not direct any particular actions . “ Right off the bat what do they do — something incredibly cryptic that nobody understands ” said Rodney Whitlock a vice president of M. L. Strategies
" In its first new episode under the presidency of Donald J. Trump “ Saturday Night Live ” opened with its vision of the most powerful man in the world — President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia smirking and chiding Mr. Trump for early missteps — followed by a monologue from the show ’s host Aziz Ansari who commented on issues of race in America and implored Mr. Trump to directly address them himself . Airing one day after Mr. Trump ’s inauguration “ S. N. L. ” which the president hosted as a candidate and has regularly attacked on Twitter did not feature an appearance from its resident Trump impersonator Alec Baldwin . Instead the show opened with the cast member Beck Bennett playing a Mr. Putin and boasting of helping to get Mr. Trump elected . “ Today many of you are scared and marching in the streets ” the Putin character said . “ You are worried that your country is in the hands of this unpredictable man . But don ’t worry . It ’s not . Relax . I got this . Putey ’s going to make everything O. K. ” He added that Russia would take care of America because “ it ’s the most expensive thing we ’ve ever bought . ” Addressing Mr. Trump directly he said “ You ’re not off to a great start man . I thought you ’d be better at this . However I ’m glad to see so many people showed up to your inauguration . ” The screen then showed video of a crowd of demonstrators on Saturday at the Women ’s March on Washington which was then corrected to an image of the more sparsely populated National Mall on Friday during the Trump inaugural festivities . “ Today ” the Putin character said “ you went to the C. I. A. and said one million people came to see you in Washington D. C. ? If you ’re going to lie don ’t make it so obvious . Say you are friends with LeBron James not that you are LeBron James . ” Mr. Ansari the Emmy and star of the Netflix series “ Master of None ” and the first performer of South Asian descent to host “ S.

" Here are the week ’s top stories and a look ahead . 1. “ From this day forward it ’s going to be only America first . ” Those were the words of President Trump at his inauguration on Friday just as rain began falling in the capital . His forceful address offered a strikingly grim view of the United States repudiated the establishment and alarmed leaders around the world — but also energized his supporters at home and abroad . At age 70 Mr. Trump became the oldest president sworn in for the first time and the first to have never served either in public office or as a military general . _____ 2. Hundreds of thousands of women gathered to protest Mr. Trump in Washington on Saturday above and many more demonstrated in cities around the nation and the world . Here is a photographic roundup . On Friday protests in the capital turned violent at times . Mr. Trump begins his term with less popular support than any new president in modern times . _____ 3. These photos show a much smaller crowd for Mr. Trump ’s inauguration than for Mr. Obama ’s in 2009 . Both were taken 45 minutes before the ceremony . Our reporters noted a “ peculiar sensation ” in Washington where pockets of eerie quiet existed as residents and others skipped town . Mr. Trump and his press secretary falsely claimed that Mr. Trump drew “ the largest inaugural crowd ever . ” Mr. Trump also said the media had invented his friction with the intelligence community and called journalists “ among the most dishonest human beings on earth . ” _____ 4. The mood among Mr. Trump ’s supporters was jubilant and beyond . “ My savior is born ” yelled Amy Azzo an Iraqi immigrant who traveled from Michigan for the inauguration . “ President Trump — I love it . ” Scattered chants of “ Lock her up ! ” came from the crowd but Hillary Clinton strode on stage with a practiced smile . _____ 5. One of Mr. Trump ’s first acts as president was to sign an executive order aimed at scaling back the Affordable Care Act . A report earlier in the week estimated that as many as 18 million people could lose insurance if major provisions of the health care law are repealed . A full digital turnover of whitehouse . gov happened within moments of Mr. Trump ’s inauguration and the official White House Twitter handles also changed over — but whether the president will forgo using his personal Twitter account remains unclear . _____ 6. The Senate confirmed the first two cabinet nominees : James N. Mattis as defense secretary above and John F. Kelly as homeland security secretary . Democrats delayed a vote on Mike Pompeo ’s confirmation as C. I. A. director until Monday . And the Justice Department cleared Mr. Trump ’s appointment of his Jared Kushner as a senior White House adviser saying that the president ’s special hiring authority exempted such a position from antinepotism laws . _____ 7. President Trump now oversees the intelligence agencies that are examining intercepted communications and financial transactions for possible links between his associates and Russian officials . Among those being scrutinized are Paul Manafort above Mr. Trump ’s former campaign chairman Carter Page
" ATLANTA — At least 18 people were killed and 43 more injured in Georgia and Mississippi after thunderstorms and tornadoes roared through the South this weekend leaving some things standing and some things fallen some lives whole and others blown to bits . Charles McDowell pastor of Barney United Methodist Church in Barney Ga . was safe at home in nearby Valdosta on Sunday . So was the modest church where he preaches to his flock of a few dozen . But many of his members were suffering — their homes damaged including roofs torn away and their electricity off . There was little for him to do but try to reach out to them on their cellphones . “ As a church ” Mr. McDowell said “ we ’re praying for each other . ” Catherine Howden a spokeswoman for Georgia ’s emergency management agency said 14 people had died and 23 had been injured in central and southern parts of the state . She said there had been up to 20 reports of tornadoes . Gov. Nathan Deal declared a state of emergency on Sunday for seven counties : Atkinson Berrien Brooks Colquitt Cook Lowndes and Thomas . “ The state is making all resources available to the impacted areas ” Mr. Deal said in a statement . He added that he was prepared to expand or extend the emergency declaration and that he was likely to seek federal help . On Sunday afternoon during a ceremony to swear in senior White House staff members President Trump said he had spoken with Mr. Deal and noted that Florida and Alabama had also been hit . Mr. Trump said he had expressed to Mr. Deal “ our sincere condolences for the lives taken ” and promised to help Georgia . He added that he planned to reach out to Florida ’s governor
" BOISSEUIL France — A furious Ducourtioux shouted with his fellow union members as they banged on the plexiglass window of a meeting hall in France . Inside was Manuel Valls the former Socialist prime minister who was campaigning for president in this bastion of the French left . A member of France ’s oldest trade union Mr. Ducourtioux 52 was a stalwart Socialist Party voter who once might have been inside cheering . But no longer . His hands callused by three decades as a metalworker Mr. Ducourtioux is angry that the Socialist government has failed to stop French automakers from moving factories outside the country as manufacturing declines in this decaying region . He said he was at risk of losing his job at an automotive subcontractor . “ Mr. Valls knew the situation here ” Mr. Ducourtioux said . “ He did nothing . ” France ’s presidential election this year is being closely watched as a barometer of European public disaffection and no party is more visibly out of favor than the governing Socialists . President François Hollande a Socialist is so deeply unpopular that he is not running for . Mr. Valls came in second out of seven candidates in a primary of parties on Sunday . With about 31 percent of the vote counted Mr. Valls trailed the top Benoît Hamon a former education minister in Mr. Hollande ’s government who took about 36 percent of the votes . More worrisome for the left was that turnout was roughly 50 percent lower than it was in 2011 when the the parties last held a primary . Few analysts believe that any of the Socialists have a real shot at retaining the presidency in the April general election . The collapse of the establishment left in France is hardly a unique phenomenon . Across Europe populist parties are gaining strength including in France
" NILES Mich . — When Jennifer Purucker 31 was asked on Saturday morning what she thought of the Women ’s March on Washington she took a sip of coffee and shook her head . “ Never heard of it ” she said . Crystal Mangold 38 paused as she carried her young daughter down Main Street . “ No idea what it is ” she said . Angie Searles 45 perked up at the mention . “ Oh I just saw that on the news ” she said . “ I don ’t know anyone who ’s going . ” The march galvanized hundreds of thousands of women across the country who packed buses and airplanes to flock to the nation ’s capital to fight for reproductive and civil rights under the Trump administration . Across the country they rallied en masse on Saturday in downtowns wearing pink knit “ pussy hats ” waving handmade signs and sharing pictures on social media with the hashtag #WomensMarch . But as conversations unfolded in Niles a riverfront town of 11000 in southwest Michigan it was a reminder of how the country has become a split screen on issue after issue . “ Those women don ’t represent me or my viewpoints ” said Leta Nielsen
" New Yorkers flooded the streets of Manhattan on Saturday aiming to send a message to President Trump that his hometown would be a center of resistance during his administration . The mayor ’s office estimated that 400000 people took part in the march which was in concert with other Women ’s March rallies across the country . With huge crowds along Fifth Avenue near Trump Tower a large slice of Manhattan came to a standstill for much of the day . Participants booed Mr. Trump and hoisted signs mocking both his hair and his relationship with President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia . It was a moment of both catharsis and camaraderie in a city that was for the most part shocked and disappointed by Mr. Trump ’s ascendance to the presidency . Holding a “ Nasty Woman ” sign Grace Huezo 20 was buoyed by the huge turnout and the joyful mood . “ I ’m hopeful to see so many people that are not giving up and they ’re keeping their spirit ” she said . “ We ’re all just going to stick together over the next four years . ” Ms. Huezo a student at Hunter College said she was marching with her sister to defend women ’s rights . She said she was appalled by the 2005 recording of Mr. Trump ’s lewd comments about women that emerged during the campaign . “ We ’re here saying ‘ No people do not have permission to grab women without our permission ’ ” she said . The march began with a rally near Trump World Tower on the East Side where Chirlane McCray the wife of Mayor Bill de Blasio led the crowd in urging Mr. Trump not to get rid of the Affordable Care Act . “ New York City has always been the center of progressive America and that will never change ” she said .

" In a few years you could be eating the next generation of genetically altered foods — potatoes that do not turn brown or soybeans with a healthier mix of fatty acids . And you may have no idea that something is different because there may be no mention on the labeling even after a law passed by Congress last year to disclose genetically modified ingredients takes effect . A new generation of crops known as rather than genetically modified is coming to the market . Created through new tools that snip and tweak DNA at precise locations they at least for now largely fall outside of current regulations . Unlike older methods of engineering genes these techniques like Crispr so far have generally not been used to add genes from other organisms into the plants . The federal Agriculture Department has asked companies to advise it of their plans . But once the companies submit data to show the agency that the gene edits do not introduce foreign genes from plant pests into the crops the agency is giving businesses the green light . Hundreds of acres of crops have already been grown in several states unencumbered by oversight or regulations . And a few people have eaten them already . “ This is not Frankenfood ” said André Choulika chief executive of Cellectis one of the companies developing crops . In October Cellectis hosted a dinner at Benoit New York the Alain Ducasse Manhattan restaurant and served dishes made from its soybeans and potatoes .

" In almost every year since the 1960 s health care spending has grown at least as fast as the overall economy and often much faster . Health economists have long debated why . Strange as it may sound how we care for our pets offers some answers . The pet care markets look a little like the market for human health care . Health spending by American households has grown 50 percent between 1996 and 2012 . Pet care spending has grown by a similar amount 60 percent though from a much smaller base . ( Americans spent more than $ 15 billion on pet health care in 2015 but $ 3. 2 trillion on human health care . ) An estimated 68 percent of households have pets those families with higher incomes spend more which is also true of human care . And they spend more toward the end of humans ’ and pets ’ lives alike . The supply of both physicians and of veterinarians has grown at a more rapid rate than overall employment . Since 1996 the number of physicians has grown by about 40 percent . The number of veterinarians is up 100 percent . “ These commonalities made us think that something else may be behind the rapid growth in human health care spending ” said Amy Finkelstein an M. I. T. economist and one of the authors of a recent study on pet care . She along with her Liran Einav and Atul Gupta of Stanford tried to find what that something else could be in their study on pet health care presented at the American Economic Association annual meeting in Chicago . “ We often blame generous insurance and significant public sector involvement but those are absent from pet care ” Ms. Finkelstein said . Some health economists say generous health insurance and significant government intervention in the health care market promote unnecessary spending . They note the United States spends more of its G. D. P. on health care than other similar advanced economies yet does not exhibit broadly better health outcomes a sign of inefficiency . But other economists argue that health care is so valuable that we might reasonably spend even more on it than we do today . Which camp is right ? The three economists pointed out that in contrast with the market for human health care there is much less government involvement in pet care . Pet health insurance is also much less common . More than 90 percent of Americans now have health insurance an industry that has been with us since before World War II . But only 1 percent of dogs and cats are insured for pet care a relatively new product . ( According to the North American Pet Health Insurance Association the first pet health insurance policy in the United States was written for Lassie
" HOLTVILLE Ala . — In an airy house here on Jordan Lake about 25 miles north of Montgomery and around the corner from cotton farms there is a television on the living room wall . The TV belongs to Myra and Raymond Turner the parents of Kevin Turner a former Alabama fullback who played eight seasons in the N. F. L. This Sunday that TV will be tuned to the N. F. L. playoffs to the game that killed their son . “ I know a lot of people are going to say ‘ How do you watch football knowing football had taken your son ’s own life ? ’ ” Raymond Turner said . “ But it ’s hard to explain really . It ’s just all so hard to explain . ” I traveled to Alabama to hear an explanation and try to understand it — and maybe even understand why they allow their two teenage grandsons to play football after Kevin the boys ’ father suffered for six long years with a brain disease that research has linked to head trauma in football . He died last March at 46 . There was no clear answer to my question only compartmentalized memories . In the house on the lake which Kevin helped his parents buy reminders of him appear at every turn .

1.0"FOXBOROUGH Mass . — The N. F. L. likes portraying itself as one big family of owners players and fans who despite their differences come together on game days . Yet at the Super Bowl in Houston in two weeks the N. F. L. may have no choice but to air a public and profound grudge on national television . If the New England Patriots defeat the Pittsburgh Steelers on Sunday as they are favored to do and go on to beat either the Atlanta Falcons or the Green Bay Packers for the title the league commissioner Roger Goodell will have to present the Lombardi Trophy to Robert K. Kraft the owner of the Patriots . The moment would be delicious payback for Kraft who is still simmering about the suspension his quarterback Tom Brady served as a result of the cheating scandal known as Deflategate after the underinflated footballs meant to give him a throwing advantage . In spite — or perhaps because — of it all New England went this season and throttled the Houston Texans last week in its playoff opener . Kraft largely kept quiet while the Brady case played out . But in a recent interview he made clear that he remains annoyed by how his best player and team were pilloried . “ Sometimes the league really messes up
" DAKAR Senegal — Four days into his term tucked into a sofa 150 miles outside the country he was elected to rule President Adama Barrow of Gambia pledged on Sunday to improve his country ’s economy free its political prisoners and create a commission to look into the brutal legacy of his predecessor . But first he has to get home . Mr. Barrow 51 has been stuck in neighboring Senegal for a week waiting for the incumbent he defeated Yahya Jammeh to step down and leave the country . After initially accepting his loss in the December presidential election Mr. Jammeh reversed himself called for a new vote and refused to give up power when his term ended on Thursday . Afraid for his safety Mr. Barrow fled to Senegal and was sworn in during an inauguration at the Gambian Embassy in Dakar . A coalition of other African countries sent troops into Gambia to evict Mr. Jammeh by force if necessary and on Saturday night Mr. Jammeh finally let go . He boarded a plane headed for exile accompanied by the president of Guinea who had gone to Gambia to persuade him to leave . Mr. Jammeh ’s first stop was Conakry Guinea . But it was not clear where his final new home would be . The departure paved the way for Mr. Barrow to take over but on Sunday afternoon he was still at a house he owns in Dakar
1.0"Brenda Barnes a corporate chief executive whose decision to leave her top job at sparked a national debate about women juggling career and family died on Tuesday in Naperville Ill . She was 63 . Her daughter Erin Barnes said the cause was complications of a stroke . The elder Ms. Barnes had had a stroke in 2010 after which she gave up her corporate career entirely . Ms. Barnes had been chief executive of North America for a year and a half when she decided in 1997 to step down saying that after two decades of grueling hours away from home she wanted to spend time with her three children ages 10 8 and 7. She was 43 at the time and overseeing PepsiCo ’s chief profit engine based in Somers N. Y. making her one of the most recognized women in corporate America . She resisted the entreaties of her peers to remain at the company explaining that she had had her fill of days and nights away from her children . “ I hope people can look at my decision not as ‘ women can ’t do it ’ but ‘ for 22 years Brenda gave her all and did a lot of great things ’ ” Ms. Barnes told The Wall Street Journal at the time . “ I don ’t think there ’s any man who doesn ’t have the same struggle . Hopefully one day corporate America can battle this . ” Her choice and the blunt language she used to describe the many burdens executive women had to shoulder elicited sharp reactions . Supporters hailed her decision to put family first . Detractors argued that her retreat from such a lofty post was a defeat for women fighting to be considered men ’s equals in the boardroom . The debate raged on television talk shows in the United States and in tabloid newspapers in London — much to the surprise of Ms. Barnes who had never seen herself as a public figure pushing a cause . A private woman by disposition ( her nickname growing up outside Chicago was Bashful ) Ms. Barnes weathered the public outcry and returned to Illinois with her family settling in Naperville about 33 miles west of Chicago . She did not fully retire from corporate life however . She became a company director

" NEW DELHI — At least 36 passengers were killed in a train derailment in southern India on Saturday night the latest disaster on India ’s old and overburdened railway system . Government and medical authorities said that at least 40 additional passengers were injured several critically and admitted to hospitals . Rescue workers struggled into the early morning to pull the injured passengers and dead bodies from the engine and nine coaches the authorities said . The accident took place in the Vizianagaram district of Andhra Pradesh state in southern India when the engine and coaches of the Hirakhand Express from Jagdalpur to Bhubaneshwar derailed at 11:15 p. m. according to a statement issued by Indian Railways the firm that runs India ’s trains . The authorities said the cause was not clear and Indian Railways announced an investigation . India ’s railways which transport 23 million people a day over more than 70000 miles of track have been neglected for years . In 2014 there were more than 27000 deaths in India . In 2012 a committee appointed to review the safety of the rail network cited “ a grim picture of inadequate performance largely due to poor infrastructure and resources . ” It recommended many urgent measures including upgrading tracks repairing bridges eliminating level crossings and replacing old coaches with safer ones that would better protect passengers in case of an accident . These remedies came with a hefty price tag : The committee said it would cost some $ 14 billion over five years to put the railways on safer footing . Still it advised that the work should proceed “ in a manner with required resources mobilized . ” This was never done . Enku Swamy the district fire officer for Vizianagaram said in a telephone interview that rescue agencies took about 40 minutes to reach the accident site
" BEIJING — It seemed that China ’s censors had finally muzzled Yang Jisheng the famed chronicler of the Mao era . Last year he had finished writing a widely anticipated history of the Cultural Revolution . But officials warned him against publishing it and barred him from traveling to the United States he has said and he stayed muted through the 50th anniversary of the start of that bloody upheaval . Now Mr. Yang has broken that silence with the publication of his history of the Cultural Revolution “ The World Turned Upside Down ” a sequel to “ Tombstone ” his landmark study of the famine spawned by Mao ’s policies in the late 1950 s . The book is the latest shot fired in China ’s war over remembering or forgetting the dark side of its Communist past a struggle that has widened under the president Xi Jinping . “ I wrote this book to expose lies and restore the truth ” Mr. Yang writes in the book which has been quietly published in Hong Kong beyond the direct reach of Chinese censors . “ This is an area that is extremely complicated and risky but as soon as I entered it I was filled with passion . ” Since Mr. Xi took power in 2012 the Communist Party authorities have denounced historians who question the party ’s lionization of its past and exhume grim events like the Cultural Revolution which Mao started in 1966 opening a decade of purges and bloodshed . Tens of millions were persecuted and perhaps a million or more people were killed in that convulsive time . But officials say dwelling on such events is subversive “ historical nihilism ” aimed at corroding the party ’s authority . In a sign of how Chinese politics has chilled Mr. Yang has said little publicly about the book . “ Since the book was published
1.0"LATE September was a frantic period for New York Times reporters covering the country ’s secretive national security apparatus . Working sources at the F. B. I. the C. I. A. Capitol Hill and various intelligence agencies the team chased several bizarre but provocative leads that if true could upend the presidential race . The most serious question raised by the material was this : Did a covert connection exist between Donald Trump and Russian officials trying to influence an American election ? One vein of reporting centered on a possible channel of communication between a Trump organization computer server and a Russian bank with ties to Vladimir Putin . Another source was offering The Times salacious material describing an odd dance between Trump and Moscow . The most damning claim was that Trump was aware of Russia ’s efforts to hack Democratic computers an allegation with implications of treason . Reporters Eric Lichtblau and Steven Lee Myers led the effort aided by others . Conversations over what to publish were prolonged and lively involving Washington and New York and often including the executive editor Dean Baquet . If the allegations were true it was a huge story . If false they could damage The Times ’s reputation . With doubts about the material and with the F. B. I. discouraging publication editors decided to hold their fire . But was that the right decision ? Was there a way to write about some of these allegations using sound journalistic principles but still surfacing the investigation and important leads ? Eventually The Times did just that but only after other news outlets had gone first . I have spoken privately with several journalists involved in the reporting last fall and I believe a strong case can be made that The Times was too timid in its decisions not to publish the material it had . I appreciate the majority view that there wasn ’t enough proof of a link between Trump and the Kremlin to write a story . But The Times knew several critical facts : the F. B. I. had a sophisticated investigation underway on Trump ’s organization possibly including FISA warrants . ( Some news outlets now report that the F. B. I. did indeed have such warrants an indication of probable cause . ) Investigators had identified a mysterious communication channel partly through a lead from operatives At one point the F. B. I. was so serious about its investigation into the server that it asked The Times to delay publication . Meanwhile
" The anxiety began well before the Cleveland convention where the candidate of the “ Forgotten Men ” the one who declared Americans “ the greatest Race on the face of this old Earth ” seemed likely to clinch his party ’s presidential nomination . Doremus Jessup the protagonist of Sinclair Lewis ’s 1935 novel “ It Can ’t Happen Here ” sees something dark and terrible brewing in American politics — the potential for “ a real fascist dictatorship ” led by the populist candidate Berzelius Windrip . Friends scoff at this extravagant concern . “ That couldn ’t happen here in America not possibly ! ” they assure him . But Jessup a Vermont newspaper editor and a “ mild rather indolent and somewhat sentimental liberal ” worries about the devastation ahead . “ What can I do ? ” he agonizes night after night . “ Oh — write another editorial I suppose ! ” When Election Day comes to pass Jessup learns that his editorials have not done the trick . The reality of the new situation feels unspeakably awful “ like the passing of a friend . ” Jessup faces the presidential inauguration in a state of high distress convinced that the nation is careering toward its doom but that nobody — least of all his fellow liberals — can do much to stop it . “ It Can ’t Happen Here ” is a work of dystopian fantasy one man ’s effort in the 1930 s to imagine what it might look like if fascism came to America . At the time the obvious specter was Adolf Hitler whose rise to power in Germany provoked fears that men like the Louisiana senator Huey Long or the radio priest Charles Coughlin might accomplish a similar feat in the United States . Today Lewis ’s novel is making a comeback as an analogy for the Age of Trump . Within a week of the 2016 election the book was reportedly sold out on Amazon . com . At a moment when instability seems to be the only constant in American politics “ It Can ’t Happen Here ” offers an alluring ( if terrifying ) certainty : It can happen here and what comes next will be even ghastlier than you expect . Yet the graphic horrors of Lewis ’s vision also limit the book ’s usefulness as a guide to our own political moment . In 1935
" LOS ANGELES — Michael Govan stood in a gallery scattered with paintings and crates at the Los Angeles County Museum of Art his arms gesturing at blank white walls his face furled in thought . Mr. Govan is the director of the museum but on this bright morning he was focused on one single project : the installation of an exhibition of paintings by Agnes Martin . No detail was too small for Mr. Govan as he squinted his eyes and directed two workers hoisting a framed canvas against a wall . “ Two inches higher ” Mr. Govan said . Still not right . “ A little to the left . ” Finally Mr. Govan nodded his approval as the work was positioned into place . “ Awesome . ’ ’ Mr. Govan could not have been more intricately involved in the details of this retrospective as he is with pretty much everything that happens on the museum campus on Wilshire Boulevard . He knew Ms. Martin before her death in 2004 and has long adored her work . He spent months visiting collectors at their homes explaining why they should lend their Martins to this public exhibition — fixating on such details as his insistence that paintings not be put under glass which he is quick to tell you obscures the fine lines of her art. ( “ Agnes Martin would be horrified to see her work under glass ” he said . “ Horrified . ” ) Mr. Govan curated the exhibition which closed after a successful run in the fall right down to the last caption and light fixture . Mr. Govan needed the diversion . As this new year begins he is consumed with an even more urgent and consequential campaign one that could help define not only Los Angeles ’s position on the world ’s art stage but Mr. Govan ’s standing in his adopted city : a $ 600 million reconstruction of Lacma . It is as ambitious in its architectural aspirations as in its cost . The project a decidedly disruptive and not entirely admired design by the architect Peter Zumthor is testing all the social political and skills that Mr. Govan has acquired after 10 years of maneuvering in a West Coast caldron of art collectors
" WASHINGTON — President Trump upended America ’s traditional bipartisan trade policy on Monday as he formally abandoned the ambitious Partnership brokered by his predecessor and declared an end to the era of multinational trade agreements that defined global economics for decades . With the stroke of a pen on his first full weekday in office Mr. Trump signaled that he plans to follow through on promises to take a more aggressive stance against foreign competitors as part of his “ America First ” approach . In doing so he demonstrated that he would not follow old rules effectively discarding longstanding Republican orthodoxy that expanding global trade was good for the world and America — and that the United States should help write the rules of international commerce . Although the Partnership had not been approved by Congress Mr. Trump ’s decision to withdraw not only doomed former President Barack Obama ’s signature trade achievement but also carried broad geopolitical implications in a region . The deal which was to link a dozen nations from Canada and Chile to Australia and Japan in a complex web of trade rules was sold as a way to permanently tie the United States to East Asia and create an economic bulwark against a rising China . Instead Mr. Trump said American workers would be protected against competition from countries like Vietnam and Malaysia also parties to the deal . But some in both parties worry that China will move to fill the economic vacuum as America looks inward and will expand its sway over Asia and beyond . Monday was a busy day for the new president . In addition to abandoning the trade deal he ordered a freeze on federal government hiring except for the military and other security agencies . He reinstituted a ban on federal funding for overseas family planning groups that assist or counsel women seeking abortions . He met with congressional labor and business leaders . And he promised to cut up to 75 percent of federal regulations . Mr. Trump ’s decision to scrap the Partnership or T. P. P. reversed a strategy adopted by presidents of both parties dating back to the Cold War and aligned him more with the political left . When he told a meeting of union leaders at the White House on Monday that he had just terminated the pact they broke into applause . “ We ’re going to stop the ridiculous trade deals that have taken everybody out of our country and taken companies out of our country and it ’s going to be reversed
" WASHINGTON — President Trump ’s first weekend in office unfolded much the way things often did during his campaign : with angry Twitter messages a familiar obsession with slights and a series of meandering and at times untrue statements all eventually giving way to attempts at damage control . The problem is that what works on the way to the White House does not always work once a candidate gets there . To the extent that there was a plan to take advantage of the first days of his administration when a president is usually at his maximum leverage Mr. Trump threw it aside with a decision to lash out about crowd sizes at his swearing in and to rewrite the history of his dealings with intelligence agencies . The lack of discipline troubled even senior members of Mr. Trump ’s circle some of whom had urged him not to indulge his simmering resentment at what he saw as unfair news coverage . Instead Mr. Trump chose to listen to other aides who shared his outrage and desire to punch back . By the end of the weekend he and his team were scrambling to get back on script . New presidents typically find the adjustment from candidate to leader to be a jarring one and Mr. Trump was not the first to get drawn into the latest flap in a way that fritters away whatever political good will comes with an inauguration . Former President Bill Clinton got off to a tough start by engaging on issues that were not central to his agenda most notably gays in the military and took a while to learn how to focus on his highest priorities . But Mr. Clinton showed none of the combativeness and anger of Mr. Trump . “ The adjustment from private citizen to running the country is unbelievably hard ” said Dan Pfeiffer a longtime adviser to former President Barack Obama . He said that what people even new presidents often fail to fully understand “ is that after you stand out there in the weather and take the oath of office in front of an adoring crowd you walk into that building and you are in charge of the free world . ” At first at least Mr. Trump seemed to be resisting the notion that he should adjust his approach now that he is in office . After all his pugilistic style was a winning formula one that got him to 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue in the first place . Many of his supporters cheer him taking on the establishment . And some allies said any blowback would not matter long anyway . “ Ultimately this is about governing
" WASHINGTON — Kellyanne Conway counselor to President Trump said on NBC ’s “ Meet the Press ” on Sunday that the White House had put forth “ alternative facts ” to ones reported by the news media about the size of Mr. Trump ’s inauguration crowd . She made this assertion — which quickly went viral on social media — a day after Mr. Trump and Sean Spicer the White House press secretary had accused the news media of reporting falsehoods about the inauguration and Mr. Trump ’s relationship with the intelligence agencies . In leveling this attack the president and Mr. Spicer made a series of false statements . Here are the facts . In fact Mr. Trump repeatedly criticized the intelligence agencies during his transition to office and has questioned their conclusion that Russia meddled in the election to aid his candidacy . He called their assessment “ ridiculous ” and suggested that it had been politically motivated . After the disclosure of a dossier with unsubstantiated claims about him Mr. Trump alleged that the intelligence agencies had allowed a leak of the material . “ Are we living in Nazi Germany ? ” he asked in a post on Twitter . Aerial photographs clearly show that the crowd did not stretch to the Washington Monument . An analysis by The New York Times comparing photographs from Friday to ones taken of Barack Obama ’s 2009 inauguration showed that Mr. Trump ’s crowd was significantly smaller and less than the 1. 5 million people he claimed . An expert hired by The Times found that Mr. Trump ’s crowd on the National Mall was about a third of the size of Mr. Obama ’s in 2009 . The truth is that it began to rain lightly almost exactly as Mr. Trump began to speak and continued to do so throughout his remarks which lasted about 18 minutes and after he finished . There is no evidence to support this claim . Not only was Mr. Trump ’s inauguration crowd far smaller than Mr. Obama ’s in 2009 but he also drew fewer television viewers in the United States ( 30 . 6 million ) than Mr. Obama did in 2009 ( 38 million ) and Ronald Reagan did in 1981 ( 42 million ) Nielsen reported . Figures for online viewership were not available . Neither number is correct according to the transit system which reported 570557 entries into the rail system on Friday compared with 782000 on Inauguration Day in 2013 . In fact similar coverings were used during the 2013 inauguration to protect the grass . The coverings did not hamper analyses of the crowd size . The Secret Service said security measures were largely unchanged this year . There were also few reports of long lines or delays . "
" WASHINGTON — Several Republican senators on Monday proposed a partial replacement for the Affordable Care Act that would allow states to continue operating under the law if they choose a proposal meant to appeal to critics and supporters of former President Barack Obama ’s signature health law . But the plan was attacked by Democrats as a step back from the Affordable Care Act ’s protections and it was unlikely to win acceptance from conservative Republicans who want to get rid of the law and its tax increases as soon as possible . If anything the proposal — by Senators Bill Cassidy of Louisiana a medical doctor and Susan Collins of Maine a moderate Republican — may show how difficult it will be for Republicans to enact a replacement for the Affordable Care Act . Legislation that can pass muster in the more conservative House may not win enough support in the Senate . A bill with broad appeal in the Senate may fail in the House . Under the proposal states could stay with the Affordable Care Act or they could receive a similar amount of federal money which consumers could use to pay for medical care and health insurance . “ We are moving the locus of repeal to state government ” Mr. Cassidy said . “ States should have the right to choose . ” The proposal shares some features with House Republican proposals : It would encourage greater use of health savings accounts and eliminate the requirement for most Americans to have insurance or pay a tax penalty . But the option for states to keep the Affordable Care Act alive will rankle the most conservative Republicans who have been trying for nearly seven years to blow it up . “ Obamacare is flawed failing and not fixable and it needs to be fully repealed ” said Representative Mark Meadows of North Carolina the chairman of the House Freedom Caucus . A stalemate between the House and Senate would leave in place Mr. Obama ’s health law but efforts by President Trump and Congress to undermine it could send health insurance markets into a tailspin . On Friday as one of his first official acts as president Mr. Trump signed an executive order that could allow officials to ease up on enforcement of the mandate requiring most Americans to have insurance . Supporters of the Affordable Care Act panned the proposal . “ Millions of Americans would be kicked off their plans costs and deductibles for consumers would skyrocket and protections for people with conditions such as cancer
" WASHINGTON — President Trump ’s cabinet continued to take shape on Monday as Representative Mike Pompeo of Kansas earned approval to lead the Central Intelligence Agency and Rex W. Tillerson the secretary of state nominee cleared a key Senate hurdle to all but assure his own confirmation . Despite some shaky appearances from his nominees on Capitol Hill and often blistering Democratic opposition Mr. Trump has thus far faced few meaningful obstacles in installing the team of his choice — aided by Senate Republicans who are eager to expedite the confirmation process . Mr. Tillerson had been the only nominee to attract notable doubts from within the Republican Senate majority briefly imperiling his prospects amid concerns over his ties to Russia and its president Vladimir V. Putin during Mr. Tillerson ’s tenure at Exxon Mobil . But on Monday Senator Marco Rubio of Florida who had emerged as a critical vote on Mr. Tillerson ’s fate announced his support . Mr. Rubio had sharply questioned Mr. Tillerson at a hearing this month chastising him in a series of interrogations over Mr. Tillerson ’s equivocating testimony on human rights issues . Mr. Rubio also had left open the possibility of opposing him on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee where Republicans hold a majority . But in a statement posted to Facebook on Monday morning Mr. Rubio said that despite his “ reservations ” about the pick the president was “ entitled to significant deference when it comes to his choices for the cabinet . ” Several hours later by a vote of Mr. Tillerson won the committee ’s recommendation . As Mr. Rubio explained his vote to reporters after the hearing a heckler sidled up beside him with a teasing prop : a model of a spine . Mr. Tillerson must still clear a full Senate vote in order to join the administration . Mr. Trump ’s aides and Senate allies had hoped to win approval on several nominees on Inauguration Day but only two national security posts — the defense secretary James N. Mattis and the homeland security secretary
" Katie Rich a writer for “ Saturday Night Live ” has been suspended from her position at that show following a widely criticized post she made Friday on her personal Twitter account in which she mocked Barron Trump the son of President Donald J. Trump . She was suspended immediately after her tweet and her suspension is indefinite according to someone familiar with the plans at “ S. N. L. ” who was not authorized by NBC to comment on personnel matters . That tweet on Friday during Mr. Trump ’s inauguration ceremony drew widespread condemnation and Ms. Rich subsequently deleted the post ( which said “ Barron will be this country ’s first homeschool shooter ” ) and deactivated her Twitter account . Her name did not appear in the closing credits of “ Saturday Night Live ” in its broadcast on Saturday . On Monday afternoon Ms. Rich reactivated her account and posted a message that said : “ I sincerely apologize for the insensitive tweet . I deeply regret my actions offensive words . It was inexcusable I ’m so sorry . ” The suspension of Ms. Rich who was hired to join “ S. N. L. ” at the end of 2013 comes at a delicate time for the program when it has felt emboldened to lampoon Mr. Trump but has faced his swift retaliation on Twitter . Following the show ’s broadcast of Jan. 14 in which the actor Alec Baldwin played Mr. Trump in a parody of his news conference from earlier that week Mr. Trump wrote on Twitter the following day : “ NBC News is bad but Saturday Night Live is the worst of NBC . Not funny cast is terrible always a complete hit job . Really bad television ! ” Mr. Trump made no public comments about Saturday ’s show in which Mr. Baldwin did not appear . NBC said on Monday that Mr. Baldwin will host “ Saturday Night Live ” on Feb. 11 and appear throughout that program . "
" WASHINGTON — A team of prominent constitutional scholars Supreme Court litigators and former White House ethics lawyers intends to file a lawsuit Monday morning alleging that President Trump is violating the Constitution by allowing his hotels and other business operations to accept payments from foreign governments . The lawsuit is among a barrage of legal actions against the Trump administration that have been initiated or are being planned by major liberal advocacy organizations . Such suits are among the few outlets they have to challenge the administration now that Republicans are in control of the government . In the new case the lawyers argue that a provision in the Constitution known as the Emoluments Clause bans payments from foreign powers like the ones to Mr. Trump ’s companies . They cite fears among the framers of the Constitution that United States officials could be corrupted by gifts or payments . The suit which will not seek any monetary damages will ask a federal court in New York to order Mr. Trump to stop taking payments from foreign government entities . Such payments it says include those from patrons at Trump hotels and golf courses loans for his office buildings from certain banks controlled by foreign governments and leases with tenants like the Abu Dhabi tourism office a government enterprise . “ The framers of the Constitution were students of history ” said Deepak Gupta one of the lawyers behind the suit . “ And they understood that one way a republic could fail is if foreign powers could corrupt our elected leaders . ” The president ’s son Eric Trump who is an executive vice president of the Trump Organization said the company had taken more steps than required by law to avoid legal exposure such as agreeing to donate any profits collected at hotels that come from foreign government guests to the United States Treasury . “ This is purely harassment for political gain and frankly I find it very very sad ” he said in an interview on Sunday . The president ’s lawyers have argued that the constitutional provision does not apply to payments such as a standard hotel room bill and is intended only to prevent federal officials from accepting a special consideration or gift from a foreign power . “ No one would have thought when the Constitution was written that paying your hotel bill was an emolument
1.0"■ The federal taxpayer will be defending President Trump in a lawsuit filed against his business ownership . ■ Mr. Trump ’s new hotel in Washington lost money in its opening months . ■ Two major donors to the Trump election effort will get plum ambassadorships . The Justice Department will defend President Trump from a new lawsuit that accuses him of violating the Constitution by allowing his hotels and business operations to accept payments from foreign governments officials said on Monday . But while Mr. Trump said on Monday that the case was “ without merit ” a Justice Department spokeswoman Nicole Navas declined to comment on it saying only “ The department is reviewing the complaint and will respond as appropriate . ” The lawsuit assigned on Monday to Judge Ronnie Abrams an appointee of President Barack Obama centers on the Constitution ’s “ emoluments ” clause which bars federal officeholders from accepting gifts or payments from foreign governments . Before his inauguration lawyers hired by Mr. Trump argued that the clause “ does not forbid transactions with foreign officials ” like paying for hotel rooms . They also said Mr. Trump would donate profits from foreign governments ’ patronage to the United States Treasury . But the lawsuit filed by Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington a liberal government corruption watchdog contends that the clause bars such transactions too and that donating profits does not solve the problem . It wants the judge to stop Mr. Trump ’s businesses from accepting such payments . It is not clear that Judge Abrams will resolve the dispute over the clause ’s meaning . First she must decide whether the group has suffered enough injury to bring a court challenge . The group argued that it had standing to sue because keeping track of foreign payments to Mr. Trump ’s businesses imposed a “ significant diversion and depletion of its time

" The death rate from cervical cancer in the United States is considerably higher than previously estimated and the disparity in death rates between black women and white women is significantly wider according to a study published Monday in the journal Cancer . The rate at which black American women are dying from the disease is comparable to that of women in many poor developing nations researchers reported . What makes the findings especially disturbing said experts not involved in the research is that when screening guidelines and monitoring are pursued cervical cancer is largely preventable . “ This shows that our disparities are even worse than we feared ” said Dr. Kathleen M. Schmeler an associate professor of gynecologic oncology at the University of Texas M. D. Anderson Cancer Center . “ We have screenings that are great but many women in America are not getting them . And now I have even more concerns going forward with the ” — expected — “ repeal of the Affordable Care Act which covers screening and the closing of family planning clinics which do much of that screening . ” The racial disparity had been noted in earlier studies but it had been thought to have narrowed because cervical cancer death rates for black women were declining . But this study said that the gap was far greater than believed . In the new analysis the mortality rate for black women was 10 . 1 per 100000 . For white women it is 4. 7 per 100000 . Previous studies had put those figures at 5. 7 and 3. 2. The new rates do not reflect a rise in the number of deaths which recent estimates put at more than 4000 a year in the United States . Instead the figures come from a of existing numbers
" NAIROBI Kenya — Tens of thousands of civilians dead countless children on the verge of starvation millions of dollars stolen by officials oil wells blown up food aid hijacked and as many as 70 percent of women sheltering in camps raped — mostly by the nation ’s soldiers and police officers . Just a few years ago South Sudan accomplished what seemed impossible : independence . Of all the quixotic rebel armies fighting for freedom in Africa the South Sudanese actually won . Global powers including the United States rallied to their side helping to create the world ’s newest country in 2011 a supposed solution to decades of conflict and suffering . Now with millions of its people hungry or displaced by civil war a radical question has emerged : Should South Sudan lose its independence ? As international frustrations and worries grow some momentum is growing for a proposal for outside powers to take over South Sudan and run it as a trusteeship until things calm down . Several academics and prominent opposition figures support the idea citing East Timor Kosovo and Bosnia as places where they say it has worked though of course there are plenty of cautionary tales where outside intervention failed like Somalia and Iraq . The Ugandan scholar Mahmood Mamdani recently floated a plan in which the African Union would take the lead in setting up a transitional government for South Sudan . Ideally
1.0"China ’s Communist Party celebrated its 95th birthday this summer with a lavish First of July gala at the Great Hall of the People in Beijing . In Shanghai where the First National Congress took place in 1921 the occasion was noted in a more subdued way with the promotion of a digital map of the important sites of the party ’s heroic early years in Shanghai . The map is a simple affair . Clicking on a man wearing scholar ’s robes for example sends a cartoon icon toddling off to the brick building on Lane 163 of Zizhong Road where Chen Wangdao one of the party ’s founding members translated “ The Communist Manifesto ” into Chinese . ( A and app version will soon be available for smartphones . ) A problem for anyone contemplating a pilgrimage to the urban shrines of the Communist Party : Much of the historic city depicted on the virtual map has been wiped off the real map of Shanghai by two decades of breakneck development . The few remaining buildings among them Dr. Sun ’s modest mansion in the former French Concession stand in the shadows of or towers . On a recent visit my quest to find Mao Zedong ’s first address in Shanghai on a street once known as the Alley of Benevolence and Kindness ended in the Jing An Kerry Center a 3. residential and office complex . The rowhouse where the future Great Helmsman once folded laundry and ate rice in an attic room now sits between a luxury mall and the Hotel ’s steakhouse . Fortunately enough examples of Shanghai ’s historic architecture have survived to give visitors a sense of what life was like when the city gave birth to the Communist Party . To walk through Shanghai ’s last remaining shikumen ( alleyway complexes entered through a kumen or gateway ) is to return to the wicked
" If you want to get some women mad there are more ways than by electing Donald Trump . Try doing what The New York Times did : writing a story about a bunch of fathers in Montclair N. J. who had to endure the hardship of watching their children for a day while their wives attended protest marches in Washington and New York . “ In their wake ” the story said “ they left behind a progressive bedroom community with suddenly skewed demographics . Routines were radically altered and many fathers tried to meet weekend demands alone for a change . ” Poor daddies . Poor kids . The headline on the home page didn ’t help matters : “ When ‘ Mommy Has to March ’ Routines Shift . ” Ouch . The headline on the story was this : “ How Vital Are Women ? This Town Found Out as They Left to March . ” As you might imagine the story rubbed more than a few readers the wrong way . Hannah Laurison of Philadelphia had this to say : And here ’s Jessica Wilbanks from Houston : “ There is so much wrong with this piece that it ’s hard to know where to start . How is it a hardship that wealthy men in a privileged community are taking care of their own offspring for less than 24 hours ? ” Not to be left out people chimed in on Twitter including this dad : The Huffington Post beat me to my job with a good piece on the matter that it posted this afternoon . Check it out here . There is pretty much nothing about this piece that I think was wisely considered for all the reasons readers already articulated . The staff produced some strong readable coverage of the march in New York but this wasn ’t among it . Here ’s the silver lining and the part I found exhilarating . The Metro editor Wendell Jamieson whose section produced the piece unequivocally acknowledged that it was a mistake . “ It was a bad idea from the ” Jamieson said . “ It was conceived with the best intentions but it fell flat . And I regret it . ” Classy . Needless to say I agree . "
" ASTANA Kazakhstan — The first meeting between Syrian rebel fighters and government officials in nearly six years of civil war ended abruptly on Monday when diplomatic talks quickly devolved into harsh words and competing accusations . The new round of talks arranged by Russia and Turkey in Astana the capital of Kazakhstan was meant to showcase Moscow ’s increasingly dominant role in the diplomacy and its new understanding with the Turkish government a leading sponsor of the rebels . But the Syrian delegations almost immediately began arguing and refused to negotiate directly . Mohammad of the Army of Islam in his opening statement labeled the government “ a bloody despotic regime ” backed by “ vengeful sectarian militias ” and called for it to release what he said were 13000 women being held as political prisoners and to end starvation sieges . That led to a heated exchange around a large circular table that forced Kazakh officials to call for calm several participants said . The lead government negotiator Bashar speaking to reporters after the opening session responded by calling the opposition delegation “ armed terrorist groups ” and accused them of “ impertinent ” and “ provocative ” behavior . The tension demonstrated the challenges that remain for Russia the Syrian government ’s most powerful backer as the Russian government tries to show its approach can accomplish more than the largely fruitless efforts led in past years by the United States and the United Nations . Expectations for progress had been low . Many diplomats and analysts say the more meaningful talks are those that have been held in recent months largely in secret among Russia Turkey and Iran . The meeting in Astana meant to send the message that Russia would seek to resolve the conflict in its sphere of influence was markedly different from the United talks that have taken place in recent winters in Geneva . Delegates crisscrossed the towering atrium of the Rixos Hotel in the remote Kazakh capital built 20 years ago on the orders of Nursultan Nazarbayev the former Communist boss who has been the country ’s president since it became independent with the collapse of the Soviet Union in 1991 . He has a reputation as a pragmatic strongman and enjoys good relations with Russia and Turkey . Palm trees planted indoors belied the subzero temperatures and blowing snow outside
" A federal judge ruled on Monday that a $ 37 billion merger between the health insurance giants Aetna and Humana should not be allowed to go through on antitrust grounds siding with the Justice Department which had been seeking to block the deal . The deal is one of two proposed by the nation ’s largest health insurers both were challenged by the Obama administration . Another federal judge is expected to rule soon on the case involving Anthem and Cigna the larger of the two deals at $ 48 billion . Citing the sweeping changes to the industry caused by the Affordable Care Act insurers had embarked on a frenzy of deal making a year and a half ago . The proposed combinations promised to reshape the industry by shrinking the number of the largest insurers to three from five the largest UnitedHealth Group remained independent . Today the industry finds itself in arguably an even greater state of flux with President Trump and the Congress having vowed to repeal the Affordable Care Act and replace it with something else the details of which are unknown . Monday ’s decision adds to the uncertainty facing the industry . While the judge found that a merger of Aetna and Humana would not be in the interest of its consumers companies are likely to remain interested in future combinations . Insurers view mergers as a way to gain greater clout in negotiations with hospitals and doctors . An Aetna spokesman said the company was reviewing the opinion and “ is giving serious consideration to an appeal . ” Humana did not respond to an email seeking comment . If the deal falls apart Aetna would have to pay Humana $ 1 billion according to the terms of the merger agreement . The combination was largely focused around the private market for Medicare Advantage plans a area in the industry in which companies offer private insurance as an alternative to the federal government ’s traditional Medicare program . Humana while smaller than its rivals has a strong position in the Medicare Advantage market and was viewed as an attractive acquisition . But the deal came under sharp criticism from consumer advocates and government officials who argued that the private market was already concentrated : Individuals would suffer from a lack of choice and competition in certain markets . UnitedHealth Humana and Aetna were the three largest players in the Medicare Advantage market according to an analysis by the Kaiser Family Foundation last year . In his ruling the judge
" WASHINGTON — The Supreme Court rejected on Monday an appeal from Texas officials seeking to restore the state ’s strict voter ID law . As is the court ’s custom its brief order in the case Abbott v. Veasey No. gave no reasons for turning down the appeal . But Chief Justice John G. Roberts Jr . issued an unusual statement explaining that the Supreme Court remains free to consider the case after further proceedings in the lower courts . The Texas law enacted in 2011 requires voters seeking to cast their ballots at the polls to present photo identification like a Texas driver ’s or gun license a military ID or a passport . Federal courts have repeatedly ruled that the law is racially discriminatory . The Texas law was at first blocked under Section 5 of the federal Voting Rights Act which required some states and localities with a history of discrimination to obtain federal permission before changing voting procedures . After the Supreme Court effectively struck down Section 5 in 2013 in Shelby County v. Holder an Alabama case Texas officials announced that they would start enforcing the ID law . After a trial in 2014 Judge Nelva Gonzales Ramos of Federal District Court in Corpus Christi struck down the law on Oct. 9 in a opinion . She said that it had been adopted “ with an unconstitutional discriminatory purpose ” and that its effect was to disenfranchise “ a disproportionate number of and Hispanics . ” In 2015 a panel of the United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit in New Orleans vacated part of the ruling concerning the law ’s purpose but affirmed the part concerning its effect . Last July the full Fifth Circuit largely adopted the panel ’s distinctions and reasoning and it returned the case to the trial court to consider an appropriate remedy . Texas officials nonetheless asked the Supreme Court to review the appeals court ’s ruling immediately . The people and groups challenging the law the officials said “ presented no evidence that the law resulted in diminished minority political participation or prevented even a single person from voting . ” The challengers responded that about 600000 registered voters in Texas or about 5 percent of all registered voters in the state
" THE decorations have been put away and mailboxes are now filling with credit card bills instead of holiday cards . If you binged on gifts and entertainment in December and your card balances are higher than you were expecting it ’s important to make a plan to pay down the debt as quickly as possible credit experts say . “ Don ’t put those bills aside thinking they ’ll look better if you come back to them later ” said Bruce McClary spokesman for the National Foundation for Credit Counseling . When it comes to paying down card debt he said “ time is not your friend . ” If you have sound credit but got a bit carried away with spending you may want to consider transferring your balances to a credit card . Zero percent balance transfer offers allow you to affordably pay the debt over time and some cards are offering people with healthy credit scores terms as long as 12 to 21 months said Nick Clements a of MagnifyMoney . The catch he said is that consumers must be disciplined and make the payments on time or they risk losing the promotional offer . That means they will be back to paying interest rates . Also he said try to find a card that doesn ’t charge a transfer fee which often is 3 to 4 percent of the balance being transferred . If you have a large balance you may not be able to transfer the full amount depending on the new card ’s credit limit . But
" Over the past decade many American cities have been transformed by young professionals of the millennial generation with downtowns turning into bustling neighborhoods full of new apartments and pricey coffee bars . But soon cities may start running out of millennials . A number of demographers along with economists and real estate consultants are starting to contemplate what urban cores will look like now that the generation — America ’s largest — is cresting . Millennials are generally considered to be those born between the early 1980 s and late 1990 s or early 2000 s and many in this generation are aging from their 20 s into the more traditionally suburban years . There are already some signs that the inflow of young professionals into cities has reached its peak and that the outflow of couples to the suburbs has resumed after stalling during the Great Recession . Dowell Myers a professor of demography and urban planning at the University of Southern California recently published a paper that noted American cities reached “ peak millennial ” in 2015 . Over the next few years he predicts the growth in demand for urban living is likely to stall . The flow of young professionals into Philadelphia has flattened according to JLL Research while apartment rents have started to soften in a number of big cities because of a glut of new construction geared toward urban newcomers who haven ’t arrived . Apartment rents in San Francisco Washington Denver Miami and New York are moderating or even declining from a year ago according to Zillow . “ Certainly the softening of rents is one sign that they are not coming in at the pace that people thought they would ” said Diane Swonk an independent economist in Chicago . The debate is full of contours and caveats but it really boils down to this : Are large numbers of millennials really so enamored with city living that they will age and raise families inside the urban core
" In 1755 a New York City newspaper carried an account of the of the governors of the newly founded King ’s College which later grew into Columbia University . At the bottom of the page ran an advertisement for a rather different occasion : the sale of “ TWO likely Negro Boys and a Girl . ” The ad would have raised few eyebrows at King ’s where many of the college ’s early presidents trustees donors and students owned slaves . But now it ’s the opening example in a new report detailing Columbia ’s historical ties to slavery . The report to be released by the university on Tuesday as part of a new website offers no dramatic revelations akin to that of the sale of 272 slaves in 1838 that helped keep Georgetown University afloat and that has raised a contentious debate about reparations today . But it illuminates the many ways that the institution of human bondage seeped into the financial intellectual and social life of the university and of the North as a whole . “ People still associate slavery with the South but it was also a Northern phenomenon ” Eric Foner the Columbia historian who wrote the report said in an interview . “ This is a very very neglected piece of our own institution ’s history and of New York City ’s history that deserves to be better known . ” Lee Bollinger the president of Columbia said that while there were as yet no plans to act on the report grappling with the university ’s “ complicity ” with slavery was necessary to address current injustice . “ Every institution should know its history the bad and the good
" Kiah Stokes celebrated New Year ’s Eve at a nightclub in Istanbul where she plays basketball for Besiktas of the Turkish league . But a night of revelry turned alarming when club employees told patrons they had to shut down early for security reasons . As Stokes and her friends left the building they saw roads . They cautiously walked for about 10 minutes before finding a taxi to take them home not knowing that a gunman had killed 39 people at another club down the street and was still at large . “ You don ’t think something can happen ” said Stokes who in September finished her second season with the Liberty of the W. N. B. A. “ Now I ’m like ‘ Wow this is just scary . ’ ” Players like Stokes have long packed up after the W. N. B. A. season and spent their winters abroad competing with teams that offer larger paychecks than the women can earn in the American league . This more W. N. B. A. players ended up in Turkey than in any other country . There are now 26 according to the league ’s players ’ association . The unrest there — an attempted coup last summer and multiple terrorist attacks — has led some players to question the costs of taking a second job overseas . It has also added urgency to efforts to keep W. N. B. A. players in the United States in the . “ It ’s kind of sad we can ’t stay home ” said Liberty guard Sugar Rodgers who played for the Turkish club Osmaniye but returned to Virginia in November because she did not feel safe . About two weeks after the Liberty were eliminated from the playoffs Rodgers joined Osmaniye which is based about two hours from the Syrian border . Shortly after her arrival a car bombing killed at least 17 people at a checkpoint in Syria ’s Aleppo Province . “ That right there shook me ” said Rodgers who has also played in France Israel and Slovakia . She acknowledged that the United States was not immune to such violence but in Turkey
" SAN FRANCISCO — On Snapchat last week MTV published an article with the headline “ Is this the thirstiest person on earth ? ” The article which ran on Snapchat ’s news service Discover appeared with a picture of a blond woman taking a selfie even though the piece was about a fully clothed man . Those kinds of risqué and misleading images will now be much less prominent on Discover because early on Monday Snapchat updated its guidelines for publishers in a way that essentially cleans up what is shown on its news service . The new rules more explicitly restrict publishers from posting questionable pictures on Discover that do not have news or editorial value . Snapchat also clarified guidelines that prevent publishers from including reports or links to outside websites that could be considered fake news saying that all content must be and accurate . The changes aim to “ empower our editorial partners to do their part to keep Snapchat an informative factual and safe environment for everyone ” said Rachel Racusen a spokeswoman for the company . Snapchat said it also planned to give publishers a tool in February that would allow them to content or stop minors from seeing some content altogether . The moves — which come ahead of an initial public offering expected for this spring by Snapchat ’s parent company Snap — underscore how the company is trying to distinguish itself from rival social media services . Facebook and Twitter typically give users including publications wide latitude in what they can post which has led the companies into one controversy after another — including criticism over fake news and outrage over harassment and abuse by internet trolls . Snapchat is acting to limit those problems in a way that is reminiscent of how traditional media companies curate what they show people . “ Snapchat thinks about the role that its content plays in the lives of consumers differently ” said Steven Kydd one of the founders of Tastemade an online food publication . “ This is cable all over again except for a mobile and global audience . ” Cleaning up what is published on Discover could have many benefits for Snapchat like helping the service appeal to advertisers
" LONDON — Prime Minister Theresa May of Britain refused to comment on Sunday about the reported failure of an unarmed British Trident missile that was from a submarine off the coast of Florida in June . Mrs. May said in a television interview with the BBC that she had “ absolute faith in our Trident missiles . ” But she would not say whether she had known about the failure or whether as The Sunday Times of London reported it had been covered up by Downing Street under her predecessor David Cameron shortly before the referendum on Britain ’s exit from the European Union . Mrs. May did not mention any missile failure in her first major speech to Parliament on July 18 when she persuaded Parliament to spend up to 40 billion pounds or about $ 53 billion then on four new submarines to keep Britain ’s nuclear deterrent up to date . “ There are tests that take place all the time regularly for our nuclear deterrence ” she said on Sunday . “ What we were talking about in that debate that took place was about the future . ” The Sunday Times reported that the Trident II D5 missile which was designed to carry a nuclear warhead but was unarmed for the test had veered off course after being fired from HMS Vengeance one of Britain ’s four aging submarines . The British Navy had not performed such a test for four years because of the expense of the missile but had carried out tests in 200020052009 and 2012 all of which had been successful and publicized by the Ministry of Defense . The current test took place after the submarine had been refitted with new missile launch equipment and upgraded computer systems . Replacing Trident has been controversial because of the cost and because the current leader of the Labour Party Jeremy Corbyn long an antinuclear campaigner is opposed to retaining Britain ’s nuclear deterrent
" LONDON — Patrick Stobbs recently sat in a conference room here playing songs from his smartphone attempting to show how his Jukedeck is at the cutting edge of music . The tune sounded like the soundtrack to a 1980 s video game . “ This is where we were two years ago ” he said looking slightly embarrassed . “ And this is where we are now ” he continued . He then played a gentle piano piece . Its melody was simple and it was unsubtle in its melancholy but there was no denying that it could work as background music for say a health insurance commercial . Mr. Stobbs didn ’t write the music himself nor did he commission it from a composer . Jukedeck is one of a growing number of companies using artificial intelligence to compose music . Their computers tap tools like artificial neural networks modeled on the brain that allow the machines to learn by doing rather as a child does . So far at least these businesses do not seem to be causing much anxiety among musicians . “ We see our system as still in its infancy it ’s only learnt a certain amount about music ” Mr. Stobbs said although he quickly hinted how he hoped Jukedeck ’s music could advance : “ There ’s no rule of physics that says computers can ’t get as good as a human . ” Having machines write music is not new . In the 1950 s the composer Lejaren Hiller used a computer to produce the “ Illiac ” Suite for string quartet the first score . Since then

" WASHINGTON — President Trump sharply changed the federal government ’s approach to the environment on Tuesday as he cleared the way for two major oil pipelines that had been blocked and set in motion a plan to curb regulations that slow other building projects . In his latest moves to dismantle the legacy of his predecessor Mr. Trump resurrected the Keystone XL pipeline that had stirred years of debate and expedited another pipeline in the Dakotas that had become a major flash point for Native Americans . He also signed a directive ordering an end to protracted environmental reviews . “ I am to a large extent an environmentalist I believe in it ” Mr. Trump said during a meeting with auto industry executives . “ But it ’s out of control and we ’re going to make it a very short process . And we ’re going to either give you your permits or we ’re not going to give you your permits . But you ’re going to know very quickly . And generally speaking we ’re going to be giving you your permits . ” The decisions expanded an effort to unravel much of the policy structure left by former President Barack Obama who made fighting climate change a central priority . Just a day earlier Mr. Trump formally abandoned the Partnership an ambitious trade pact negotiated by Mr. Obama . In his opening days in office Mr. Trump has also modified or reversed Mr. Obama ’s policies on health care abortion and housing while ordering a freeze of any pending regulations left behind by the former administration . The pipelines were more about symbol than substance but generated enormous passion on both sides of the debate . Mr. Obama rejected the proposed Keystone pipeline in 2015 arguing that it would undercut American leadership in curbing the reliance on carbon energy . The Army sidetracked the Dakota Access pipeline in North Dakota last month in the waning days of the Obama administration . Environmental activists quickly denounced Mr. Trump ’s decisions . “ Donald Trump has been in office for four days and he ’s already proving to be the dangerous threat to our climate we feared he would be ” said Michael Brune the executive director of the Sierra Club . Mr. Trump made clear on the campaign trail that he saw Mr. Obama ’s environmental policies as a threat to the economy and dismissed climate change as a hoax perpetrated by China .

" WASHINGTON — During a private meeting with congressional leaders on Monday President Trump asserted that between three million and five million unauthorized immigrants had voted for his Democratic opponent and robbed him of a victory in the national popular vote . There is no evidence to support the claim which has been discredited repeatedly by numerous . That did not stop Sean Spicer the White House press secretary from standing by the president ’s words on Tuesday during a briefing with reporters at the White House . “ As I said I think the president has believed that for a while based on studies and information he has ” Mr. Spicer said . That much appears to be true . Mr. Trump repeatedly raised doubts about the integrity of the American voting system in the period before the election in November and has falsely said since his victory that millions of people voted illegally . Pressed to present the evidence on Tuesday Mr. Spicer appeared to conflate two different studies that Mr. Trump ’s staff had previously cited in defending his claim . “ There ’s one that came out of Pew in 2008 that showed 14 percent of people who voted were noncitizens ” Mr. Spicer said . “ There ’s other studies that have been presented to him . ” Neither study Mr. Spicer apparently referred to supports Mr. Trump ’s claim . The first study was conducted in 2014 by professors at Old Dominion University and discussed on Monkey Cage a blog hosted by The Washington Post . Using data from the Cooperative Congressional Election Study the researchers found that 14 percent of noncitizens who responded to the survey in 2008 and 2010 said they were registered to vote . The problem is that the study relied on flawed data and was roundly criticized by political scientists who said that a more careful examination of the data revealed no evidence that noncitizens had voted in recent elections . The second study conducted in 2012 by the Pew Center on the States found that 24 million voter registrations were no longer valid or “ significantly inaccurate ” that more than 1. 8 million dead people were still listed on the voter rolls and that almost three million were registered in multiple states probably because they had moved from one state to another . The study did not find evidence that those errors led to voter fraud however simply that they presented avoidable costs and inefficiencies in the electoral process . The primary author of the study David Becker made that plain in a Twitter post in November . On Tuesday he wrote on Twitter that voting integrity in the November election had in fact improved . The absence of studies supporting the claim is not all that is working against Mr. Trump . Election and law enforcement officials all over the country who monitored reports of voter fraud state by state have said they found no credible evidence of widespread fraud . Mr. Trump ’s assertion likewise found little backing from his Republican colleagues on Capitol Hill . “ I ’ve seen no evidence to that effect
" ■ White House press secretary Sean Spicer stood by President Trump ’s false assertion that millions of illegal voters gave Hillary Clinton her popular vote win . ■ Gag orders seem to be proliferating throughout the federal bureaucracy but the national parks are taking to Twitter to speak up . ■ A new national security political action committee assembled by former intelligence officers and national security officials has begun posting “ no spin ” research on the president ’s business interests abroad . Sean Spicer the White House press secretary confirmed on Tuesday that President Trump has long believed that millions of undocumented immigrants voted illegally in the 2016 election furthering a false claim from the podium of the West Wing briefing room and refusing to rule out an investigation down the road . “ He said 3 to 5 million people could have voted illegally based on the studies that he ’s seen ” Mr. Spicer told stunned reporters acknowledging a statement that Mr. Trump made privately in a meeting with congressional leaders on Monday afternoon . Mr. Trump and his aides repeatedly suggested during the transition period that “ irregularities ” contributed to his loss by nearly 3 million ballots to Hillary Clinton . Mr. Trump won the Electoral College but his popular vote loss to Mrs. Clinton was the largest for a winning presidential candidate since the disputed election of 1876 . Democrats and some Republicans have pointed to that margin to claim that Mr. Trump is an illegitimate president . Such assertions have rankled Mr. Trump deeply . A November 2016 blog post on Infowars the conspiracy website run by radio host Alex Jones posited the idea that roughly 3 million people voted illegally . Mr. Jones has hosted Mr. Trump on his radio show in the past . The assertion was based on tweets from a voter expert who claimed to have a study . However there ’s no evidence of the study . And officials in swing states where Mr. Trump secured victory many of which are governed by Republicans say that there is no evidence of such fraud . Mr. Spicer also made vague reference to another Pew Research Center study that supposedly backed up Mr. Trump but the author of the study in question David Becker now executive director of the Center for Election Innovation and Research

1.0"Good morning . ( Want to get California Today by email ? Here ’s the . ) JoAnna Klein a science writer brings us today ’s introduction . Earlier this month the scientific journal Conservation Biology published a study that found that nearly half of the fish sampled at roughly 10 percent of Los Angeles sushi restaurants were not what they were purported to be on menus . In many cases fish were substituted with cheaper more environmentally sustainable catches . But in some instances replacement fish were actually endangered or threatened . Halibut and red snapper were found to be the most frequently misidentified . Between 2012 and 2014 researchers from the University of California Los Angeles and Loyola Marymount University sent their students to 26 Los Angeles restaurants with various price points and high ratings on Yelp and Zagat . Their mission was simple : Order dishes containing each of nine targeted fish that are common on menus and often mislabeled confirm with the restaurant that the fish was what the menu said it was collect a piece of sushi about the size of a kernel of corn drop it in a labeled jar of ethanol and take it back to the lab for DNA analysis . Knowing rates of mislabeled fish is important the authors say because it threatens consumer health . It also threatens a marine ecosystem and the billion dollar fishing industry that depends on it . But studies in the past have been inconsistent in terms of seafood mislabeling rates . “ We wanted to see why there is that huge level of variation ” said Demian Willette a biologist who helped lead the study . So they did the same thing at the same place each year for four years . The students collected more than 350 samples over all . In every restaurant there was at least one case of mislabeled fish . But the researchers say you can ’t blame the restaurant in every case . Like their diners and even their grocers the restaurants were most likely victims of fish fraud . For consumers going forward Mr. Willette suggested asking your waiter directly what you ’re ordering . The Monterey Bay Aquarium ’s Seafood Watch also offers resources and a phone app to help .

1.0"WASHINGTON — Senate Democrats have one particular judge ’s name in mind as they await the identity of President Trump ’s Supreme Court nominee : Merrick B. Garland . Democrats and their allies remain furious that Senate Republicans refused to even consider Judge Garland President Barack Obama ’s nominee to the high court with 10 months remaining in Mr. Obama ’s second term . That deep resentment is certain to color their handling of Mr. Trump ’s choice just as it has contributed to their resistance to moving quickly on Mr. Trump ’s cabinet selections . All indications are that they see the forthcoming nomination as a chance to take a strong stand against the new president since they still have the power to filibuster a Supreme Court choice — at least for now . “ I haven ’t seen the names ” said Senator Patrick J. Leahy Democrat of Vermont and a veteran of multiple Supreme Court fights . “ But when they had a consensus person with Merrick Garland every single Republican who raised their hand and solemnly swore before God to uphold the Constitution refused to follow the Constitution and even have a hearing . ” Top Democrats say they don ’t intend to play “ tit for tat ” with the nomination . But they say they will insist on what they consider to be a mainstream candidate capable of securing at least the 60 votes needed to thwart any filibuster . Otherwise they promise to do whatever they can to block the nominee . “ We are not going to do what the Republicans did ” said Senator Chuck Schumer of New York the Democratic leader “ but if the candidate ’s out of the mainstream I can tell you I will fight and my caucus will fight tooth and nail against them . ” The chief reason that Democrats will not do what the Republicans did is that they can ’t — Republicans remain in the Senate majority which last year enabled them to refuse to even schedule a hearing and now gives them control over the confirmation process . But unlike with cabinet nominees Democrats could still employ a filibuster against a Supreme Court pick because the high court was excluded from a 2013 change engineered by Democrats to thwart filibusters against nominees . If Democrats hold out Senator Mitch McConnell of Kentucky the majority leader will no doubt come under pressure to wipe out the possibility of filibuster against Supreme Court nominees . Given the steps Republicans were willing to take to hold open the vacancy created by the death of Antonin Scalia Democrats believe Senate Republicans might choose to eliminate that filibuster power
" BEIJING — For China President Trump ’s scrapping of the Pacific trade agreement is a chance to extend Beijing ’s economic and political influence . And it is an opportunity to deepen ties with its neighbors in Asia . But with a cooling economy at home and a looming leadership the last thing President Xi Jinping wants is a trade war though officials are girding for that possibility . Rather China ’s leaders crave stability and predictability . Early signs indicate they may not get their wish . The Chinese fear that if Mr. Trump was willing to toss aside years of delicate negotiations with allies and decades of American trade policy he could also go his own way on issues he has staked out with Beijing including Taiwan and the South China Sea . As if to bolster that point on Monday — the same day that Mr. Trump withdrew from the Partnership the trade agreement — his spokesman said the United States would prevent China from accessing islands it claims in the South China Sea a threat that one nationalist Chinese newspaper had already warned would mean war . “ This shows that Trump might act on his words ” Deng Yuwen a public affairs commentator in Beijing said in an interview . “ With previous presidents their election promises weren ’t taken so seriously . ” He added “ That means China must take his other warnings more seriously especially about the South China Sea and Taiwan . ” Mr. Trump ’s goal in squelching the trade agreement was to protect American jobs and businesses . His trade officials have argued that the deal does not do enough to help the United States or to contain China which was not invited to join the agreement . But in killing an agreement designed to limit China ’s vast economic reach in Asia and anchor America ’s presence in the world ’s fastest growing region analysts said Mr. Trump created a void that President Xi was already practicing to fill . Only last week Mr. Xi was trying on the mantle of global leadership at the World Economic Forum in Davos Switzerland suggesting that with the United States in retreat
" For Donald J. Trump the TV star ratings were made to be embellished . This turns out to be true as well of Donald J. Trump the president . Mr. Trump spent his first weekend in office at war with math . He said on Saturday that his inauguration crowd — which photographs showed was dwarfed by Barack Obama ’s estimated 1. 8 million in 2009 — “ looked like a million a million and a half . ” His staff members backed up that claim with what his adviser Kellyanne Conway memorably termed “ alternative facts . ” For the political news media the brazenness was stunning . But those of us who cover television have seen this kind of thing before : the inventions of a celebrity surrounded by yes men and women who creates his own reality . We recognize it because not so long ago that celebrity was Donald J. Trump . Mr. Trump has a reputation among TV reporters for using his own bespoke numbers . In 2015 he came to a Television Critics Association panel for his final season hosting “ The Celebrity Apprentice ” and declared it “ the Number 1 show on television . ” It was not . Publicly available Nielsen ratings flatly proved that . Pressed by reporters he insisted that it was at least the show on Monday nights . It was not that either . ( It finished the season 67th . ) It was a bizarre performance even by the usual standards of the critics association sessions . “ The Apprentice ” was in its first season a genuine hit . It declined afterward but hung on as a modest performer . That ’s no mean feat . But that wasn ’t enough for Mr. Trump . So it wasn ’t true for Mr. Trump . Last year Mr. Trump ’s former “ Apprentice ” publicist Jim Dowd was interviewed for the PBS “ Frontline ” election documentary “ The Choice . ” Mr. Trump he recalled would demand that he call up reporters and tell them “ Number 1 show on television won its time slot
1.0"WASHINGTON — Democrats continue their rigorous questioning of President Trump ’s nominees for cabinet positions and other important posts . Here are key moments from today : ■ Representative Tom Price of Georgia nominated to be health and human services secretary defended his investments in an Australian pharmaceutical company during his time in Congress . “ The reality is that everything that I did was ethical above board legal and transparent ” he said . ■ Senator Orrin G. Hatch Republican of Utah lamented “ the of the nomination process . ” ■ Representative Mick Mulvaney of South Carolina the nominee for budget director said that tackling government waste and reducing debt would be his top priorities . ■ The toughest questions that Mr. Mulvaney faced on Tuesday came from Senator John McCain Republican of Arizona . He asked Mr. Mulvaney about his record of voting for cuts to military spending and appeared to be shocked when Mr. Mulvaney could not remember those votes . ■ Linda E. McMahon the former chief executive of World Wrestling Entertainment and Mr. Trump ’s choice to lead the Small Business Administration said her entrepreneurial background suited her for the job . ■ Ms. McMahon assured senators that she would be a vigilant opponent of restrictive government regulations . A background investigation of Mr. Price says he understated the value of his investments in an Australian pharmaceutical company Innate Immunotherapeutics and claimed income tax deductions that he could not substantiate . The findings emerged from a review of Mr. Price ’s tax returns and other official documents by committee staff members from both parties . In a questionnaire in December the committee staff said Mr. Price understated the value of 400613 shares of the Australian company that he purchased in August 2016 through “ a private placement offering . ” The value of the shares was listed on the questionnaire as $ 50 000 to $ 100
" The storm that devastated parts of the South over the weekend swept into the Northeast with strong gusts of wind and heavy rain knocking down power lines and tree branches flooding some coastal towns and disrupting transit across the region . By Tuesday morning the worst of the storm had passed . The damage was significantly less than the storm ’s southern passage which left at least 20 people dead including 15 in Georgia . On the Jersey Shore flooding closed some roads in places like Wildwood Atlantic City and Sea Bright . Photographs and videos shared on social media showed water pooling in and outside of the Hoboken Terminal . On the South Shore of Long Island rain flooded the streets in Freeport and Lindenhurst . Some New Jersey school districts were closed or delayed opening on Tuesday because of the weather . In New York small sections of the Belt Parkway Van Wyck Expressway and Expressway were flooded briefly . Power failures were reported in parts of Long Island New Jersey Staten Island and Queens . Wind speeds of more than 60 miles per hour in New Jersey and about 40 m. p. h. in New York prompted warnings from city officials on Monday but the wind tapered significantly by Tuesday morning . The storm surge caused water to rise about feet in New York which officials described as mild . About 70 to 80 trees were blown down said Nancy Silvestri a spokeswoman for the New York City Emergency Management Department . “ There are no major impacts from either last night ’s high tide period or this morning ” Ms. Silvestri said . Residents from around the region spoke about the inconveniences and less about damage : The memory of hurricane Sandy which caused a storm surge of more than 10 feet in places and left behind significantly more destruction loomed larger .

" Rare is the individual who hasn ’t tripped over a pet or uneven pavement tumbled off a bike slipped on ice or maybe wiped out skiing or skating . Some get injured while others go unhurt — often claiming it ’s because they knew how to fall . According to paratroopers stunt professionals physical therapists and martial arts instructors there is indeed a “ right way ” to fall — and it can save you a lot of grief if you know how to do it . Although often associated with older people falls occur at any age and are the most common cause of injury seen in emergency rooms in the United States . The Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality estimates that falls cause more than a third of emergency room visits around 7. 9 million a year . “ As physical therapists we talk a lot about preventing falls but what we don ’t talk about is what to do when you actually do fall ” said Jessica Schwartz a physical therapist in New York City who trains athletes and people with prosthetic limbs to fall without hurting themselves . “ It ’s almost inevitable you are going to fall so you really should know what to do . ” The number one thing to remember she said is to protect your head . So if you find yourself falling pivot to your side and tuck in your head . “ Have you seen those slip and fall cartoons where the characters fall flat on their back or face ? Don ’t do that ” said Dr. Schwartz . “ You ’ll hit your head like a coconut and get a concussion ” and the reverse motion or bounce of your head after impact “ will give you something like whiplash . ” Moreover falling straight forward or backward raises the risk of damaging your spine and vital organs .

" LOS ANGELES — Oscar voters showered the “ La La Land ” with 14 nominations on Tuesday a tie with “ Titanic ” and “ All About Eve ” for the most in Academy Award history . But the academy also moved past two #OscarsSoWhite years by honoring six black actors — a record — and including diverse films like “ Moonlight ” “ Fences ” and “ Hidden Figures ” in the best picture race . [ The list of nominees | Where to stream them | Nominees react | Who got snubbed ? ] “ It makes me feel good to see such a multifaceted group of people get recognized ” said Barry Jenkins the director of “ Moonlight ” which received eight nominations . Speaking by phone from Amsterdam where he was promoting the film he added “ It ’s an affirmation that film has the power to erode barriers and reveal what makes us all human . ” Nine movies most of them cobbled together outside the studio system will compete for Hollywood ’s top prize . Filling out the best picture race are “ Arrival ” a thriller the drama “ Hell or High Water ” “ Manchester by the Sea ” about a mournful New England handyman the subtitled “ Lion ” and “ Hacksaw Ridge ” Mel Gibson ’s true story of World War II heroism . In a surprise Mr. Gibson also drew a nomination as best director officially ending his status as a Hollywood pariah for his offscreen behavior . Joining him in the directing field were Damien Chazelle ( “ La La Land ” ) Denis Villeneuve ( “ Arrival ” ) Mr. Jenkins ( “ Moonlight ” ) and Kenneth Lonergan ( “ Manchester by the Sea ” ) . Perhaps the biggest upset happened in the best actress category . “ Arrival ” emerged as one of the most honored films with support in eight categories but its star Amy Adams failed to receive a nod for best actress .

" JERUSALEM — In a pointed act of defiance against international pressure Israel on Tuesday approved a huge new wave of settlement construction in the occupied West Bank . The announcement made clear that just a few days into the Trump presidency the Israeli government feels emboldened to shake off the constraints imposed by the Obama administration and more willing to disregard international condemnation . Leaders from 70 countries met in Paris more than a week ago and issued a warning that the peace solution was imperiled by Israel ’s expanding of settlements in territory in the West Bank and East Jerusalem as well as violence against Israelis . But even though Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has endorsed the principle of states in the past few days Israel ’s campaign of settlement building has only accelerated . The first step came on Sunday when the Jerusalem City Council approved 566 new housing units in East Jerusalem that had been delayed over President Barack Obama ’s objections . Then on Tuesday the Israeli government announced that 2500 new housing units would be built in the West Bank . Officials said most would be built in “ settlement blocs ” referring to areas of the West Bank that Israel has long intended to keep under any future agreement with the Palestinians possibly in return for land swaps along the boundary that separated Israel from the West Bank before the 1967 war . But in years of failed negotiations the Israelis and Palestinians have never agreed on the size or location of such blocs . The Israeli Ministry of Defense said 900 of the newly announced homes were being planned for Ariel an urban settlement of about 20000 residents that Israel considers a “ bloc ” but is strategically — and problematically — located in the heart of the West Bank . It also said it would bring to the cabinet a plan to build a large industrial zone to create work for Palestinians in the southern West Bank . “ We are going back to normal life in Judea and Samaria ” Avigdor Lieberman Israel ’s defense minister said in a statement announcing the new settlement building referring to the West Bank by its biblical names . Asked about the Israeli move the White House spokesman Sean Spicer
" Drugs approved in recent years that can cure hepatitis C may have severe side effects including liver failure a new report suggests . The number of adverse events appears relatively small and the findings are not conclusive . But experts said the report was a warning that should not be ignored . It involves nine widely used antiviral drugs that were heralded as a huge advance because they greatly increased cure rates seemingly with few side effects . The report will be published online on Wednesday by the Institute for Safe Medication Practices a nonprofit in Horsham Pa . that studies drug safety . Its findings are based on the group ’s analysis of the Food and Drug Administration ’s database of reports from doctors around the world of adverse events that might be related to medications . Dr. Robert S. Brown the director of the Center for Liver Disease and Transplantation at at Columbia and Weill Cornell who was not involved in the study said that there had been other scattered accounts of problems with the new drugs and that they should be investigated further . “ We don ’t want people to ignore it and lead to risks to patients ” he said . “ We don ’t want people to overreact and not treat patients who should be treated . A lot of doctors are unclear about it and if doctors are unclear patients are too . ” Dr. Brown added that problems might arise from some doctors ’ prescribing incorrectly giving the drugs to patients with liver function too poor to tolerate them or benefit from them . Hepatitis C is an enormous public health problem . Caused by a virus it leads to chronic liver disease in most people who contract it and some eventually develop cirrhosis and liver cancer . In the United States an estimated 2. 7 million to 3. 9 million people have chronic hepatitis C at least 20000 a year die from it and it is the leading cause of liver transplants

Barely six weeks later Crystal Stroup ’s college career was suddenly and violently derailed . In October 2015 after a small at their apartment her friends got worried because Ms. Stroup had had too much to drink . They enlisted the male student from downstairs to look after her while they went out for food . The next morning Ms. Stroup woke up disoriented and in pain . Large bruises in the shape of hand prints were emerging on her upper arm and thigh . She struggled to go to class where she told a friend “ I ’ve been raped . ” Kansas State University had been warned about the man Jared Gihring . Another student Sara Weckhorst said she had complained to university officials more than a year earlier that he had raped her while she was passed out drunk at a fraternity house . On Jan. 3 Mr. Gihring 22 pleaded not guilty to charges of raping both women . A lawyer for Mr. Gihring Brenda Jordan did not respond to requests for comment . But it was only after Mr. Gihring ’s arrest by the police here in July — more than two years after Ms. Weckhorst first complained — that Kansas State took action to expel him . Whether or not Ms. Stroup ’s alleged rape was foreseeable — one of the issues posed by a lawsuit she filed against the university — her case raises disturbing questions about repeat offenses on campus and whether universities do enough to prevent them . For several years researchers have been fiercely debating how many campus rapes are committed by serial offenders .

1.0"ASTANA Kazakhstan — Two days of talks over the Syrian civil war concluded on Tuesday with an agreement by Iran Russia and Turkey to enforce a fragile partial . But neither the Syrian government nor the rebel fighters — who briefly met face to face for the first time in nearly six years of war — signed the agreement . While the three powers agreed to establish a mechanism to monitor and enforce the nearly they did not say what the mechanism should look like deferring that issue for now . The statement at least on paper brought Iran on board with recent new cooperation between Russia and Turkey and it strengthened Turkey ’s commitment to separating rebel groups it supports from jihadist groups . But representatives of the Syrian delegations — both from the government and opposition — immediately expressed reservations . They emphasized that they had not signed on to a document that had been brokered by the main sponsors of the warring sides in the country but not by Syrians themselves . Russia is the most powerful backer of the Syrian government which is also closely allied with Iran while Turkey has been among the main supporters of rebel groups . Despite the supposed new clashes were reported in Wadi Barada a besieged area and source for most of the drinking water for Damascus the Syrian capital . Water supplies have been cut off for weeks and the government and rebel sides have blamed each other . The agreement among Iran Russia and Turkey was announced a day after the Syrian factions exchanged harsh words at the start of the talks held in Astana capital of Kazakhstan . A main result of the meeting was to firm up Russia ’s growing role in the Syria diplomacy establishing the Astana talks as a part of but not a replacement for the Geneva process that has been spearheaded for years by the United Nations and the United States . The new document said meetings in Astana

Then the lost his job when the ensuing cash crunch hit demand for motorcycles and scooters sold by the company where he worked Hero MotoCorp Ltd. After that the prospective refused to let the wedding go forward until he found another job . “ So I lost my job and I lost my marriage ” he said in an interview at a protest where he shouted slogans with more than 100 workers let go by Hero . Mr. Rathore is one among a large number of Indians — the precise number is not known — who have lost their jobs since Nov. 8 when Mr. Modi abruptly banned 86 percent of the country ’s currency in a bid to eliminate “ black money ” currency on which taxes had not been paid . For the sake of secrecy the government largely avoided printing replacement notes in advance . So there has been an acute and protracted shortage of cash as the government struggles to catch up . That in turn has proved economically damaging . Exactly how harmful remains hard to determine but the available data is not reassuring . Demand for vegetables is declining because people don ’t have the money to pay for them for example and some service industries are reporting steep job losses . The International Monetary Fund this month cut its projected growth rate for India by one percentage point for the current fiscal year to 6. 6 percent . While the full impact is still difficult to discern there is little doubt who is suffering the most . “ This has actually hurt the poor enormously ” said Nasser Munjee chairman of DCB Bank and a company director at HDFC and Tata Motors .

" KABUL Afghanistan — The attorney general of Afghanistan has ordered the arrest of nine bodyguards over accusations of rape and torture made by a political rival and the vice president himself remains under investigation officials said on Tuesday . The arrest warrants confirmed by the attorney general ’s office came after Gen. Abdul Rashid Dostum the more senior of Afghanistan ’s two vice presidents and his bodyguards refused to show up for questioning about the allegations despite repeatedly being summoned by prosecutors . The case is testing the government ’s resolve to deliver justice in the face of a potentially dangerous showdown between a powerful former warlord and the shaky coalition administration of which he is a part . Ahmad Ishchi a elder from General Dostum ’s own Uzbek ethnic group has accused the vice president of abducting him from a sports stadium in November personally and repeatedly beating him and ordering his men to sexually assault him with an assault rifle during five days of captivity in the northern province of Jowzjan . Attorney General Mohammad Farid Hamidi declined to discuss the case in detail on Tuesday but said that his prosecutors were focused on enforcing the law with precision . “ We are following the law in this case hair by hair ” Mr. Hamidi said . President Ashraf Ghani has said that he takes the allegations against General Dostum seriously and that the case will be handled fairly within the judicial system to show that no one is above the law . Mr. Ghani has told Western diplomats that he is tired of officials breaking the law with impunity and he characterized the Dostum case as a challenge to his government . But many have said that Mr. Ghani shares the blame for bringing General Dostum onto his ticket in the first place despite grave concerns about the former warlord ’s human rights record . Spokesmen and aides to General Dostum could not be reached for comment about the warrants on Tuesday but in recent weeks they have rejected the summons against him as unconstitutional . Bashir Ahmad Tayanj a spokesman for General Dostum said last month that the allegations were baseless and that the vice president had constitutional immunity from prosecution as part of the president ’s elected ticket .

It was written on Day 90 of his trek but his stream of photographs and anecdotes stopped on Jan. 21 Day 100 . At 1:15 p. m. on that day Mr. Baumer 33 was walking on the shoulder of U.

1.0"FULING China — mountains rise high in this sleepy Yangtze River district best known for its crunchy pickled mustard tubers . But one of these mountains is not like the others . On the peak of Jinzi Mountain in Fuling a single chimney stands sentinel over the adjacent Wu River . The chimney has been idle since it was built decades ago . Only in recent years has the public learned why . Fifteen years ago the local government announced that inside the mountain lay the remnants of what was once one of China ’s most ambitious military infrastructure projects : the 816 nuclear plant . Initiated in the 1960 s during the height of tensions between China and the Soviet Union the 816 project was China ’s first attempt to build a nuclear reactor that could produce plutonium without Soviet involvement . But there was one catch . To reduce the possibility of an attack Chinese officials and engineers made the unusual decision to place the reactor underground complicating an already challenging engineering process . Over the next 18 years more than 60000 workers participated in the risky project and some died in the process . The result was what is said to be the world ’s largest artificial cave able to withstand the force of thousands of tons of explosives as well as a magnitude 8 earthquake . But when China began a sweeping civilian defense conversion of many of its military projects in the early 1980 s work on the nearly finished plant was abruptly called to a halt . For 26 years it functioned partly as a chemical fertilizer factory before being revived for tourism in 2010 — an improbable twist of fate for this quirk of Cold War history . Still for many former workers the 816 project remains a source of bitter regret . Even as China charges ahead with an ambitious — if controversial — plan to build nuclear plants around the country and expand the use of nuclear energy military nuclear projects like 816 have all but been forgotten . “ Back then the project took so much from these young men including our livelihoods

He was 94 . His death at a hospital followed an operation to remove a blood clot from his leg his daughter Margaret Bleakley said . The survival of the 30 noncombatants was a secret of World War II : the story of 13 female nurses 13 male medics and the crew of a medical evacuation plane who were stranded behind enemy lines for nine weeks hiding in villages and caves in wintry mountains afflicted with lice and dysentery often near starvation and hunted by German patrols . Their odyssey was classified during the war and for years afterward to protect partisan fighters Allied agents and villagers who gave them food shelter and guidance . Some were shot by the Germans for their acts of kindness and after the war as rumors became death sentences those even suspected of helping the Americans were executed by Albania ’s Communist dictator Enver Hoxha whose rule ended with his death in 1985 . “ For many years
" Of all forms of homage attention to detail is perhaps the most loving . It requires not just knowledge and dedication but also thoughtfulness . It prizes accuracy both out of respect to the historical record but also to those who wrote it . It celebrates the vision of the original creators more than the disruptive instincts of reinterpreters . By that measurement “ The New Edition Story ” a vibrant fiercely committed that begins Tuesday on BET is overflowing with love — a jubilant celebration of a group that was preternaturally talented and rivetingly tortured . Few groups in modern black pop are as deserving of this treatment as New Edition which transported the elegance of the male vocal groups of the 1970 s into the first wave of RB ’s dance with in the late 1980 s . The act released four essential albums a couple more good ones and spun off careers for all its members — solo work by Bobby Brown Johnny Gill and Ralph Tresvant and a group Bell Biv DeVoe made up of the others . None of this happened without conflict . New Edition which hailed largely from the Orchard Park projects in the Roxbury section of Boston was a black act that was chided by its label for not being mainstream enough . The members squabbled with executives management and among themselves . This was in many ways the archetype of the modern boy band — so much so that when New Edition left Maurice Starr who produced the group ’s early songs he created New Kids on the Block essentially a white copy . For all of its musical influence

The takeover came five days after the International Automobile Federation the sport ’s governing body approved the sale of Formula One to Liberty Media an American company that invests in entertainment and sports . Liberty said in a statement on Monday that the transaction price represented an enterprise value for Formula One of $ 8 billion and an equity value of $ 4. 4 billion . The Ecclestone who has been in charge of the series for nearly 40 years will remain as an honorary chairman and will be an adviser to the circuit according to Liberty . “ I ’m very pleased that the business has been acquired by Liberty ” Ecclestone said . “ I am sure that Chase will execute his role in a way that will benefit the sport . ” Last September Liberty Media Corp. which is controlled by the tycoon John Malone ended years of uncertainty about the ownership of Formula One when it announced plans for a takeover .

" EARNING THE ROCKIES How Geography Shapes America ’s Role in the World By Robert D. Kaplan 201 pp. Random House . $ 27 . Well over half of American voters having cast ballots for Hillary Clinton or candidates awoke the next morning to a country that seems not only unfamiliar but . Populists embrace a celebrity billionaire evangelicals welcome a Lothario conservatives accept an opportunist whose only ideological commitment is to himself . The Republican establishment proves helpless against the hijacking of the party the mainstream media prove ineffectual against the tide of fake news and the political system proves vulnerable to the machinations of a sinister foreign government . Longstanding global alliances are questioned longstanding political norms are trashed — and then the candidate with the plurality loses . In what alternative universe does this make any sense ? As Karl Marx said in a very different context : All that is solid melts into air . Or maybe not . Maybe the political air is turbulent but the country ’s tectonic fundamentals remain solid . Maybe American politics and geopolitics rest on a foundation as immovable as the rivers and plains of the country itself . For those who feel disoriented and also ( perhaps especially ) for those who feel triumphant Robert D. Kaplan ’s small but magisterial new book “ Earning the Rockies ” is a tonic because it brings fundamentals back into view . With only 180 uncrowded pages of text this is a book that can be read on a flight but fully digesting it will take much longer . Every page brings a fresh insight a telling aperçu a bracing reality check . If you do read the book at 30000 feet it will make you yearn to be down below . To understand the country Kaplan posits one must still “ earn the Rockies
" Justin Peck stops short of calling it a protest dance but his newest ballet “ The Times Are Racing ” is certainly of the moment . The dancers wear sneakers and and hoodies emblazoned with words like Unite React Act Protest and Fight . ( The costumes are by Humberto Leon for Opening Ceremony . ) The electronic music is Dan Deacon ’s suite from “ America ” a 2012 album written out of his frustration with the state of the country and the world . Mr. Peck 29 started choreographing the dance before the presidential election but after Donald J. Trump won he said the ballet changed course . A few days before its Thursday premiere at New York City Ballet Mr. Peck the company ’s resident choreographer and a soloist — this time he even included a part for himself — spoke about the work his love of tap and how his teenage obsession with the video game Dance Dance Revolution had not been in vain . Here are edited excerpts from that conversation . How did the political landscape shape this ballet ? We were working on this throughout the election . The day after the election was such an emotional and sobering moment . It felt like a turning point for the piece . Did the choreography change or become more focused after the election ? It changed . It ’s a less optimistic piece than it could have been . But it ’s also going back to the music . It ’s such a cathartic piece and I think the choreography and the arc of the whole ballet has that feeling of exhaustion and running in a way that doesn ’t need to be spelled out too much . I feel people are going to be able to interpret it in whatever way they want to . How did the sneakers come in ? When I ’m in sneakers it changes my body carriage . I feel more in my own skin . I also think there ’s less emphasis placed on line and accuracy and more freedom to dance with more energy and fullness and risk . I ’ve done one piece with sneakers for L. A. Dance Project and I really enjoyed working in that way and I wanted to explore it more at New York City Ballet . We have “ [ N. Y. Export : ] Opus Jazz ” and “ West Side Story Suite
" WASHINGTON — President Trump on Wednesday began a sweeping crackdown on illegal immigration ordering the immediate construction of a border wall with Mexico and aggressive efforts to find and deport unauthorized immigrants . He planned additional actions to cut back on legal immigration including barring Syrian refugees from entering the United States . At the headquarters of the Department of Homeland Security Mr. Trump signed a pair of executive orders that paved the way for a border wall and called for a newly expanded force to sweep up immigrants who are in the country illegally . He revived programs that allow the federal government to work with local and state law enforcement agencies to arrest and detain unauthorized immigrants with criminal records and to share information to help track and deport them . He also planned to clamp down on legal immigration in another action expected as early as Thursday . An draft of that executive order obtained by The New York Times would indefinitely block Syrian refugees from entering the United States and bar all refugees from the rest of the world for at least 120 days . When the refugee program resumes it would be much smaller with the total number of refugees resettled in the United States this year more than halved to 50000 from 110000 . It would also suspend any immigration for at least 30 days from a number of predominantly Muslim countries — Iran Iraq Libya Somalia Sudan Syria and Yemen — while the government toughened its already stringent screening procedures to weed out potential terrorists . White House officials declined to comment on the coming plan but in a interview that aired Wednesday on ABC Mr. Trump acknowledged that it aimed to erect formidable barriers for those seeking refuge in the United States . “ It ’s going to be very hard to come in ” Mr. Trump said . “ Right now it ’s very easy to come in . ” He also said his administration would “ absolutely do safe zones in Syria ” to discourage refugees from seeking safety in other countries and chided Europe and Germany in particular for accepting millions of immigrants . “ It ’s a disaster

Trump called some Mexican immigrants rapists threatened to deport millions of them and promised to build a wall to keep others out Mexican officials counseled caution saying it was merely bluster from an unlikely candidate who if elected would never follow through . Now after just five days in office President Trump is looking a lot like Candidate Trump — and the Mexicans are furious . With just a few strokes of the pen on Wednesday the new American president signed an executive order to beef up the nation ’s deportation force and start construction on a new wall between the nations . Adding to the perceived insult was the timing of the order : It came on the first day of talks between top Mexican officials and their counterparts in Washington and just days before a meeting between the two countries ’ presidents . The action was enough to prompt President Enrique Peña Nieto of Mexico to consider scrapping his plans to visit the White House on Tuesday according to Mexican officials . In a video message delivered over Twitter on Wednesday night Mr. Peña Nieto did not address whether he would cancel the meeting saying only that future steps would be taken in consultation with the country ’s lawmakers . Instead he reiterated his commitment to protect the interests of Mexico and the Mexican people and chided the move in Washington to continue with the wall . “ I regret and condemn the United States ’ decision to continue with the construction of a wall that for years now far from uniting us divides us ” he said . It mattered little to Mexicans whether Mr. Trump ’s order would receive congressional approval or the funding required to fulfill it . The perceived insults endured during the campaign had finally turned into action . Decades of friendly relations between the nations — on matters involving trade security and migration — seemed to be unraveling . Calls began to come in from across the political spectrum for Mr. Peña Nieto to cancel his visit
" WASHINGTON — Scientists and environmentalists reacted with fear this week as the Trump administration purged nearly all mention of climate change programs from the White House and State Department websites and ordered a freeze on federal grant spending at the Environmental Protection Agency and other government agencies . Memos ordered employees of at least four agencies not to send out news releases or to create social media posts blog entries or official website content and to consult with senior officials before speaking to the news media . Such memos or oral communications landed this week at the E. P. A. and the Departments of the Interior Agriculture and Health and Human Services in a broad halt to external communications while the Trump administration struggles to put political appointees into position . Small of communications — apparently in dissent — appeared on Twitter but they were quickly stopped . The Twitter posts of the social media division of the Badlands National Park broadcasting the threat of climate change became something of a cause célèbre before they disappeared from the platform on Tuesday . A White House spokesman Sean Spicer attributed those Twitter posts to a former park employee who had commandeered the park ’s account . Longtime employees at three of the agencies — including some career environmental regulators who conceded that they remained worried about what President Trump might do on policy matters — said such orders were not much different from those delivered by the Obama administration as it shifted policies from the departing White House of George W. Bush . They called reactions to the agency memos overblown . On Wednesday Douglas Ericksen a spokesman for the E. P. A. said that grants had been only briefly frozen for review and that they would be restarted by Friday . “ I ’ve lived through many transitions and I don ’t think this is a story ” said a senior E. P. A. career official who spoke on the condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to speak to the news media on the matter . “ I don ’t think it ’s fair to call it a gag order . This is standard practice . And the move with regard to the grants when a new administration comes in you run things by them before you update the website . ” But the White House and State Department did delete nearly all mentions of climate change policy — which had been a top priority for Mr. Obama — and have begun replacing them with pages detailing Mr. Trump ’s plans to roll back those policies — a top priority for the new president . It is standard practice for new administrations to make changes to their websites to reflect their different policy positions . The full contents of the Obama administration ’s White House and State Department websites including working links to climate change reports have been archived and are readily available to the public . But environmental advocates and Democrats took advantage of the moves noting that they appeared to target agencies that focus on environmental protection and scientific research and calling them a chilling signal that the Trump administration intends to suppress communication about science and environmental policy and possibly scientific data . If nothing else the memos and ensuing reaction furthered the impression of turmoil throughout the government as Mr. Trump tries to assert control . Scientists said that even if no climate or other scientific data has been deleted from government websites
" WASHINGTON — President Trump intends to move forward with a major investigation of voter fraud that he says cost him the popular vote White House officials said Wednesday despite bipartisan condemnation of his allegations and the conclusion of Mr. Trump ’s own lawyers that the election was “ not tainted . ” In his first days in the Oval Office Mr. Trump has renewed his complaint that millions of people voted illegally depriving him of a majority . In two Twitter posts early Wednesday morning the president vowed to open an inquiry to reveal people who are registered to vote in multiple states or who remain on voting rolls long after they have died . “ We have to understand where the problem exists how deep it goes and then suggest some remedies to it ” said Sean Spicer the president ’s press secretary . He said the White House would reveal more details this week . But voting officials in both parties across the country said the answer to those questions is already clear : Fraudulent voting happens in tiny sporadic episodes that have no impact on the outcome of elections . It is virtually impossible several state election officials said that millions of people voted illegally in last year ’s presidential contest . In fact that was the conclusion of Mr. Trump ’s own lawyers last year as they sought to stop recount efforts in Michigan Pennsylvania and Wisconsin . “ All available evidence suggests that the 2016 general election was not tainted by fraud or mistake ” Mr. Trump ’s lawyers wrote in their response to recount petitions by Jill Stein the Green Party presidential candidate . Mr. Spicer said the lawyers were referring only to states where Mr. Trump campaigned extensively . In Ohio Secretary of State Jon A. Husted a Republican said Wednesday in an interview that there was “ no evidence ” that voter fraud was happening on a large scale . Edgardo Cortés
" When Indira Islas was in third grade at Centennial Arts Academy a public elementary school in Gainesville Ga . she decided it was time to get serious . It was 2006 and she was in the lowest reading group in her class . She had been in that group since arriving two years earlier speaking no English in Gainesville a city of 38000 just northeast of Atlanta ’s booming outer suburbs . But being at the bottom went against everything she believed about herself . “ I wanted to be with the smart kids ” she recalls . Starting the year before in second grade she read every volume of the “ Magic Tree House ” books in her library a series about two ordinary siblings who climb into their backyard treehouse and to Pompeii the Wild West the ice age feudal Japan and beyond . “ I absolutely loved them ” she says . “ It was like going on adventures all over the world . ” It was also the opposite of her own life . Indira left Mexico for the United States at age 6 with her parents and two younger sisters . Her mother cleaned houses when she wasn ’t caring for the children — there would eventually be seven of them — and her father worked in construction and there was no money for lessons or soccer clubs let alone traveling . “ I ’d hear about trips and experiences of my white friends and I remember thinking : I ’ll never go to the beach or Disney World for spring break ” Indira says . Her parents told her that education was all that mattered and she had to spend all her free time inside
" President Trump who flew across the country on hundreds of nights during the 2016 campaign to sleep in his own bed has now spent five straight days in the unfamiliar surroundings of the White House . His aides said privately that he seemed apprehensive about the move to his new home but Mr. Trump has discovered there is a lot he likes . “ These are the most beautiful phones I ’ve ever used in my life ” Mr. Trump said in a telephone interview Tuesday evening . “ The world ’s most secure system ” he added laughing . “ The words just explode in the air . ” What he meant was that no one was listening in and recording his words . The president sat at his desk — the one used by former Presidents Barack Obama George W. Bush Bill Clinton Ronald Reagan and John F. Kennedy among others — at the end of his fourth full day in office . His mornings he said are spent as they were in Trump Tower . He rises before 6 a. m. watches television tuned to a cable channel first in the residence and later in a small dining room in the West Wing and looks through the morning newspapers : The New York Times The New York Post and now The Washington Post . But his meetings now begin at 9 a. m. earlier than they used to which significantly curtails his television time . Still Mr. Trump who does not read books is able to end his evenings with plenty of television . In between Mr. Trump signs executive orders in the Oval Office and has meetings in the West Wing . “ They have a lot of board rooms

The initiation fee at Mr. Trump ’s club in Florida — which the president himself has called the Winter White House — has doubled to $ 200 000 after membership applications surged in the wake of Mr. Trump ’s election the head of membership there said . Bernd Lembcke the managing director at the Palm Beach Fla . club said the change in the initiation fee had been planned last fall before the election and that $ 200 000 had been the fee before 2010 when it was cut in half because of the recession . But Mr. Lembcke who has been at the club for 21 years said that it also reflected the upswing in ’s popularity . “ We have had a sudden surge in requests ” he said adding that new members must be recommended by someone who is already a member as is the case at many private clubs .

" We ’re resurfacing this article in light of President Trump ’s recent comments on Nafta . After calling it the “ worst trade deal ” he seems to be softening his stance . It was a deal that created a deeply intertwined economy stretching from the Arctic to Central America and a generation of mostly warm relations between the United States and its two neighbors . It has also contributed to the loss of manufacturing jobs in the United States and added to discontent in the communities that lost them . That in turn helped propel a sharp critic of the deal to the White House . So with Donald J. Trump in charge what happens now to the North American Free Trade Agreement ? It ’s one thing to assail it as the “ worst trade deal ever ” as the president did during the campaign . It ’s quite another to come up with an arrangement that is more advantageous to American workers and businesses . “ Nafta is logically the first thing for us to deal with ” said Wilbur Ross the president ’s nominee to be commerce secretary in his confirmation hearing . It will be he said a “ very very early topic in the administration . ” So what might that actually mean ? What can the president actually do what benefits might be attained for the United States and what could go wrong ? Trade experts say there really is room to make major change in the agreement . A renegotiation could well lead to a better deal for all three countries . But it will require the United States to make concessions that the Trump administration may be wary of offering . If not approached carefully revamping an agreement that has created the economic underpinning of major industries would risk American jobs as well as higher prices for consumers . And the closer the Trump administration gets to blowing up the deal the larger those risks loom . Before diving into what could go wrong — and right — as President Trump looks to rework Nafta it ’s worth starting with the basics . What is Nafta ? On Oct. 71992 President George H. W. Bush stood in San Antonio flanked by the president of Mexico and the prime minister of Canada . “ This meeting marks a turning point in the history of our three countries ” he said . “ We are creating the largest richest and most productive market in the entire world . ” Mr. Bush ’s successor Bill Clinton was the one to push the North American Free Trade Agreement through a divided Congress . By 1994
" How could Mexico inflict the most damage on the United States ? In normal times this question would not be top of mind for Mexican policy makers . Mexican governments over the last have consistently pushed back against the nation ’s historical resentment toward the United States hoping to build a more cooperative relationship with its overbearing northern neighbor . But these aren ’t normal times . As President Trump prepares the opening gambit in his project to either renegotiate the North American Free Trade Agreement or pull out Mexico ’s most important strategic goal is narrowing to one word : deterrence . It must convince Mr. Trump that if he blows up the trade agreement on which Mexico has staked its hopes of development by weaving its economy ever more closely into that of the United States the United States will suffer too . The critical question is whether Mexico ’s threat will be convincing . Mexico ’s main challenge as it confronts a hostile Trump administration is the enormous asymmetry of the bilateral relationship . Ending Nafta would hurt the United States : Six million American jobs depend on exports to Mexico according to Mexican officials . But to Mexico it could prove devastating . Mexico has relied on the pact to draw foreign capital into the country not only ensuring multinational companies stable access to the largest consumer market in the world but also guaranteeing that their investment is safe noted Luis Rubio who heads the Center of Research for Development in Mexico City . The makings of a Mexican strategy for defending its interests started coming into focus on Monday when President Enrique Peña Nieto declared that negotiations for a future relationship with the United States would not be limited to trade . “ We will bring to the table all themes ” he said in a speech . “ Trade yes but also migration and the themes of security including border security terrorist threats and the traffic of illegal drugs weapons and cash . ” His hope is that by introducing broader uncertainty about the bilateral relationship — Will Mexico still cooperate in the fight against drug trafficking ? Will it stop foreign terrorists from using Mexico as a way station into the United States ? — Mexico can raise the stakes enough for Mr. Trump to reconsider his “ America first ” approach to commerce . “ Mexico has a lot of chips to play ” said Jorge Castañeda a former foreign secretary who has staked out a combative approach . Let Mr. Trump pull the United States out of Nafta he argues . Instead of stopping Central American migrants at its southern border
" WASHINGTON — The Trump administration is preparing a sweeping executive order that would clear the way for the C. I. A. to reopen overseas “ black site ” prisons like those where it detained and tortured terrorism suspects before former President Barack Obama shut them down . President Trump ’s draft order titled “ Detention and Interrogation of Enemy Combatants ” and obtained by The New York Times would also undo many of the other restrictions on handling detainees that Mr. Obama put in place in response to policies of the George W. Bush administration . If Mr. Trump signs the draft order he would also revoke Mr. Obama ’s directive to give the International Committee of the Red Cross access to all detainees in American custody . That would be another step toward reopening secret prisons outside of the normal wartime rules established by the Geneva Conventions although statutory obstacles would remain . Mr. Obama tried to close the prison at Guantánamo Bay Cuba and refused to send new detainees there but the draft order directs the Pentagon to continue using the site “ for the detention and trial of newly captured ” detainees — including not just more people suspected of being members of Al Qaeda or the Taliban like the 41 remaining detainees but also Islamic State detainees . It does not address legal problems that might raise . The draft order does not direct any immediate reopening of C. I. A. prisons or revival of torture tactics which are now banned by statute . But it sets up policy reviews to make further recommendations in both areas to Mr. Trump who vowed during the campaign to bring back waterboarding and a “ hell of a lot worse ” — not only because “ torture works ” but because even “ if it doesn ’t work they deserve it anyway . ” Elisa Massimino the director of Human Rights First denounced the draft order as “ flirting with a return to the ‘ enhanced interrogation program ’ and the environment that gave rise to it . ” She noted that numerous retired military leaders have rejected torture as “ illegal immoral and damaging to national security ” and she said that many of Mr. Trump ’s cabinet nominees had seemed to share that view in their confirmation testimony . “ It would be surprising and extremely troubling if the national security cabinet officials were to acquiesce in an order like that after the assurances that they gave in their confirmation hearings ” she said . A White House spokesman did not immediately respond to an email inquiring about the draft order including when Mr. Trump may intend to sign it . But the order was accompanied by a statement that criticized the Obama administration for having “ refrained from exercising certain authorities ” about detainees it said were critical to defending the country from “ radical Islamism . ” Specifically
" Mary Tyler Moore who died on Wednesday at 80 had a career in show business . But she is most remembered for two indelible sitcom roles : Laura Petrie on “ The Dick Van Dyke Show ” and later Mary Richards on “ The Mary Tyler Moore Show . ” [ Read Mary Tyler Moore ’s obituary | 5 great episodes to stream ] Ms. Moore first appeared in The New York Times in 1962 during the first season of “ The Dick Van Dyke Show ” which ran from 1961 to 1966 . A reporter interviewed her during a brief trip to New York to CBS executives and affiliates . ( “ When they saw Mary there was quite a bit of applause and a few whistles ” a network spokesman said . ) By 1965 the show was a hit and Ms. Moore was a star . The writer Joanne Stang called her the “ virtually uncontested popularity queen of weekly television ” marveling that Ms. Moore “ has made housewifery a highly palatable pastime . ” “ I guess they simply like me ” Ms. Moore said in the article . At the time she was preparing to try to leverage her TV success into a film career having recently signed a contract with Universal . But she was similarly about her prospects . “ If I don ’t have the chemistry for the big screen I guess I ’ll look for something else to do when the ‘ Van Dyke Show ’ goes off ” she said . Ms. Moore did appear in films like “ Thoroughly Modern Millie ” “ What ’s So Bad About Feeling Good ? ” and “ Change of Habit ” but it was another television show that became her defining role . “ The Mary Tyler Moore Show ” which Ms. Moore produced with her Grant Tinker debuted in 1970 arriving in an era whose social mores were signified by the groaner headline The Times used to introduce it and other new series : “ Out of the Kitchen Ladies . ” Early coverage was similarly dismissive : “ Mary Tyler Moore is caught in a preposterous item about life as an ‘ associate producer ’ in a TV newsroom ” Jack Gould wrote in The Times in a preview of the 1970 TV season . In his brief review of “ The Mary Tyler Moore Show ” Mr. Gould complained that the star was saddled with “ one set of bizarre happenings at a TV station ’s newsroom and another in her living accommodations . ” But within a few years
" “ Let ’s get her some sex . ” Susan Silver says that was one of her chief contributions as a writer on “ The Mary Tyler Moore Show . ” Playing the beloved young housewife Laura Petrie a few years earlier Ms. Moore and her TV husband Dick Van Dyke had been made to sleep in separate beds . But it was the 1970 s now . Even good girls had sex . Ms. Silver and the other women writing for “ The Mary Tyler Moore Show ” made sure of it . [ Read Mary Tyler Moore ’s obituary | How she changed fashion ] As Ms. Moore ’s new sitcom character the independent single career woman Mary Richards put it in one episode : “ I ’m hardly innocent . I ’ve been around . Well all right I might not have been around . But I ’ve been nearby . ” Ms. Silver said there was no particular feminist agenda for the show . There was however an number of female writers on it — well over a dozen in the show ’s run that started in 1970 . They were encouraged she said to write from their own experience and to let Mary Richards ’s derive “ organically . ” That made “ The Mary Tyler Moore Show ” a laboratory for the social issues of the day which in some cases were being reflected for the first time on television . Sex birth control equal pay workplace sexism homosexuality — all took a turn on the show and not from the bully pulpit but from the “ girl ” who could turn the world on with her smile . Here ’s how they played : When Lou Grant ( Ed Asner ) interviews Mary Richards for an associate producer job in his Minneapolis TV newsroom he asks questions that women in the workplace often got asked but that weren ’t necessarily legal : How old are you ? Are you married ? Divorced ? What religion are you ? She calls him out but answers anyway
" She had us at the hat toss . Mary Richards was a modest Midwestern girl to be sure but she had style and she had spunk as her new boss Lou Grant pointed out the day she walked into the newsroom in her white boots a pleated miniskirt and those impeccable manners . When she threw her tam in the air during the show ’s opening credits we knew she was thrilled to be single and on her own in the big city of Minneapolis . But as the series unfolded and we watched Mary Tyler Moore ’s most famous character dress for work in the uniform of career women all over the country — the clingy knit dresses the matching pantsuits the Evan Picone separates — she showed us her heart was in that newsroom . Ms. Moore died on Wednesday in Greenwich Conn . [ Read Mary Tyler Moore ’s obituary | 5 great episodes to stream ] There was a cultural sweet spot in the 1970 s as the old social mores unraveled ( along with the “ sweater girl ” ) and women flexed new muscles as working women divorced women women commited to the single life newly conscious women — to use the parlance of the feminist playbook — and fashion reflected the fluidity of that time . As women were reinventing themselves fashion helped them along . Clothing even in the office was colorful and personal those jersey dresses and knit pantsuits moved with the body . And they were womanly . Mary ’s inherent authority — that moral compass — was never compromised by the fact that she dressed in the basic idiom of her gender . ( By the next decade that freedom would be snuffed out
" MOGADISHU Somalia — When the first explosion rang out the men on the hotel patio looked up for a moment then at one another — and kept on eating breakfast . Mogadishu the capital of Somalia long ago grew accustomed to such jarring sounds and nobody seemed surprised by a loud bang somewhere not too far away . It took another even louder explosion a few minutes later to get everyone ’s attention . Something fatal was going on . A of the militiamen who guard the hotel piled into a pickup with their Kalashnikovs and ammunition vests while the photographer Tyler Hicks and I grabbed our gear — cameras notebooks bulletproof vests press credentials bottles of water — and climbed into an armored truck slamming the door tight behind us . We headed for the hospital . I have been to Mogadishu many times but this was my first visit in several years and when I got to town I was struck by how much progress the capital seemed to be making . There was still plenty of evidence of the city of old — the crushed houses craters and walls — but there were also new apartment complexes crowded markets and freshly painted shops selling TVs . It was even possible to go out for pizza Tuesday night something I would never have dared before . The scene at the hospital tore at that hopeful illusion . The floor was slippery with blood . Dozens of wounded people streamed in bleeding from their heads faces
4.0"PARIS — France ’s financial prosecution office opened an embezzlement investigation Wednesday into François Fillon a leading presidential candidate following a newspaper report that his wife had been paid around $ 535 000 in public money for a job a revelation that could upend the tightly contested election . Mr. Fillon who won November ’s primary has been considered a favorite in the race but now must contend with questions about whether the payments to his wife were inappropriate . According to the satirical weekly The Canard Enchaîné Mr. Fillon ’s wife Penelope received about 500000 euros over eight years first as his parliamentary assistant and then as assistant to his deputy Marc Joulaud who took over when Mr. Fillon became a minister in the government in 2002 . It is not illegal in France for members of Parliament to employ family and around 10 to 15 percent do so according to French media . But if Mrs. Fillon did nothing holding a fake job in effect in return for the public funds
" Usain Bolt is no longer a Olympic gold medalist . Bolt and the Jamaican team have been stripped of their relay gold medal from the Beijing Games in 2008 because one runner Nesta Carter was found guilty of a doping violation the International Olympic Committee said on Wednesday . Bolt won the 100 meters the 200 and the 4x100 relay at the last three Summer Olympics for a total of nine gold medals tied for the most of any track athlete . Carter initially tested negative after the race in 2008 . But his sample was one of many retested by the I. O. C. last year . It was found to contain a prohibited stimulant methylhexaneamine . Carter ’s lawyer told Reuters on Wednesday that he intended to file an appeal of the ruling to the Court of Arbitration for Sport . Olympic officials last year intensified scrutiny of samples from past Olympics after Russia was found to have executed an elaborate doping scheme . Dozens of athletes from the Beijing and London Games have been found upon retesting of their stored samples to be guilty of doping violations . Many were medalists . It is standard practice for Olympic officials to store urine samples for up to a decade so they may conduct additional tests often with more advanced newly developed techniques . Carter was also a part of the winning 4x100 relay team in London in 2012 but no announcement about the status of that medal has been made . The I. O. C. directed the international track federation to “ modify the results ” of the 2008 event . Trinidad Japan and Brazil were second third and fourth in the race and would each move up a notch . The United States dropped the baton in its heat and did not make the final . The I. O. C. also told the Jamaican federation to secure the return of the physical gold medals . The other two team members in the final were Asafa Powell and Michael Frater . The Jamaican team finished in 37 . 10 seconds which was a world record at the time . When one member of a team tests positive it is typical for the entire team to be stripped of its medals although there have been exceptions . Marion Jones lost two relay medals from 2000 after doping violations but her teammates were allowed to keep theirs after an appeal to the Court of Arbitration for Sport . When news of Carter ’s positive test first emerged last year Bolt told The Guardian
" UNIONDALE N. Y. — Seeking to meet growing electric demand in the Hamptons with renewable energy the Long Island Power Authority approved the nation ’s largest offshore wind farm on Wednesday set for the waters between the eastern tip of Long Island and Martha ’s Vineyard . The farm with as many as 15 turbines capable of powering 50000 average homes over all is the first of several planned by the developer Deepwater Wind . It will be in a parcel with room for as many as 200 turbines that the company is leasing from the federal government . “ It is the largest project to date but it will not be the last project ” the power authority ’s chief executive Thomas Falcone said before the vote as a crowd of supporters erupted in whoops and applause . Wind power has struggled to take off in the United States but the Long Island project signals that the promise of a new source of electricity is poised to become part of the national energy mix . It has been given new life by New York ’s push to meet Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo ’s goal of drawing 50 percent of the state ’s power from renewable sources by 2030 . That goal includes 2. 4 gigawatts of offshore wind enough to power 1. 25 million homes . It is the largest commitment to offshore wind in the country and is part of the state ’s way of showing the nascent industry it is serious about developing the resource . “ This project will not only provide a new reliable source of clean energy but will also create jobs continue our efforts to combat climate change and help preserve our environment ” Mr. Cuomo said Wednesday in a statement two weeks after he publicly called for the power authority to approve the proposal . The project ’s cost was projected at $ 1 billion but is now expected to be $ 740 million . Deepwater plans to finance the project with loans and equity investments
" TOKYO — President Trump ’s decision to pull the United States out of the Partnership trade deal should have been good news for Hitoshi Kondo a Japanese rice farmer . The sweeping agreement negotiated by the Obama administration and formally rejected by Mr. Trump on Monday would have opened swaths of Japan ’s highly protected agricultural sector and was bitterly opposed by farmers . Now without American involvement the deal looks as good as dead . Mr. Kondo isn ’t celebrating though . “ It ’s actually scarier because what comes next will be a lot harsher ” he said on Wednesday as Japanese leaders scrambled to find a coherent response . What comes next many in Japan believe could be a bruising showdown between Tokyo and Washington . They fear a return to the trade wars of the 1980 s and early ’90s when many Americans saw Japan as an untrustworthy economic adversary . The is a setback for Japan ’s prime minister Shinzo Abe . Mr. Abe viewed the Partnership as a way to advance two cherished goals : drawing the United States closer to Japan and other friendly Pacific Rim countries ( the trade deal known as TPP does not include China the region ’s increasingly bristly superpower ) and bolstering Japan ’s lackluster economy . Such is Mr. Abe ’s enthusiasm for the deal that his government finished ratifying it on Friday just before Mr. Trump ’s inauguration despite Mr. Trump ’s promise to withdraw . Mr. Trump has repeatedly said he wants to alter the American trade relationship with Japan
" When you are traveling solo it ’s not always a breeze to strike up a conversation with a stranger . In fact how do you meet other single travelers or locals in the first place ? And if you ’re looking for friendship — or even something more — how do you ensure that amid all the fun you don ’t neglect to take safety precautions ? Before we get to tactics it ’s helpful to know that you are likely to be rewarded for overcoming apprehensions about approaching someone new when you ’re on the road . “ Its easy to imagine all the ways things will go badly or believe that this person doesn ’t want to connect ” said Nicholas Epley a professor of behavioral science at the University of Chicago Booth School of Business . But if you reach out he continued “ almost everybody reaches back . ” Social scientists have found that making such connections whether traveling or not boosts happiness and yet strangers in proximity “ routinely ignore each other ” as Dr. Epley and his colleague Juliana Schroeder put it in the Journal of Experimental Psychology last year . During a series of nine experiments they saw again and again that we underestimate other people ’s interest in connecting . How to break the ice then ? Dr. Epley suggests simply saying to that stranger on the bus or in the cafe : “ Hi I ’m visiting . Can you tell me what I ought to see in town ? ” “ Everybody loves to brag about their city ” he said . Or offer a compliment he suggested . “ I think you ’re just best off in your relationships if you ’re transparent with people . ” ( This is not to gloss over any genuine concerns about talking to strangers Dr. Epley said .

" Now that Joaquín Guzmán Loera the crime lord known as El Chapo has been extradited from Mexico and has pleaded not guilty in Brooklyn to charges of running the planet ’s biggest drug empire his prosecution will enter a crucial phase — provided of course he does not manage to tunnel free from the jail in Manhattan where he is being held . Two chief questions will define what comes next : Will Mr. Guzmán decide to go to trial ? And if he does what sort of defense will he mount to counter what appears to be a Matterhorn of evidence against him ? When Robert L. Capers the United States attorney in Brooklyn outlined the government ’s case against Mr. Guzmán at a news conference on Friday he seemed unable to disguise a sly smile of satisfaction . After all that morning Mr. Capers ’s office had filed a memorandum that set forth in exhaustive detail the cinematic story of Mr. Guzmán ’s rise from a teenage marijuana farmer to an international kingpin who armed himself with a diamond encrusted pistol . It further noted that dozens of witnesses were lined up to testify and corroborate what prosecutors described as extensive secret recordings in which Mr. Guzmán discussed drug transactions . Several lawyers who have represented drug lords in the past said that the aggressive tenor of the memo suggested that at least for now federal prosecutors were serious about trying Mr. Guzmán and were unlikely to offer him a deal to plead guilty to lesser charges . Mr. Guzmán moreover is facing life in prison on a sweeping count of running a continuing criminal enterprise . So there was no real downside the lawyers said for him to fight the government ’s case . “ The government has made it clear that they ’re going full bore with this ” said David O. Markus who negotiated the 2006 guilty pleas for Gilberto and Miguel Rodríguez Orejuela Colombian brothers who helped found the Cali cartel . “ For El Chapo
" With one dramatic no a major artist has just escalated the culture world ’s war against Donald J. Trump . For more than 20 years the artist Christo has worked tirelessly and spent $ 15 million of his own money to create a vast public artwork in Colorado that would draw thousands of tourists and rival the ambition of “ The Gates ” the saffron transformation of Central Park that made him and his collaborator and wife two of the most artists of their generation . But Christo said this week that he had decided to walk away from the Colorado project — a silvery canopy suspended temporarily over 42 miles of the Arkansas River — because the terrain federally owned has a new landlord he refuses to have anything to do with : President Trump . His decision is by far the most visible — and costly — protest of the new administration from within the art world whose dependence on and sometimes politically conservative collectors has tended to inhibit galleries museums and artists from the kind of public disavowal of Mr. Trump expressed by some other segments of the creative world . Last week the artist Richard Prince fired an opening salvo returning a $ 36 000 payment for an artwork depicting Ivanka Trump the president ’s daughter owned by her family . The Christo project titled “ Over the River ” conceived with his wife who died in 2009 has been fiercely opposed in state and federal court by a group of Coloradans who contend that it will endanger wildlife and cause other problems in Bighorn Sheep Canyon .

" A team of American chefs on Wednesday won the biennial Bocuse d’Or culinary competition — the equivalent of the Olympics for professional cooks — for the first time in the contest ’s history . In the finals in Lyon France a group of 10 chefs and helpers from the United States won the gold medal . Norway took the silver medal and Iceland won the bronze . In 2015 an American team was awarded the silver medal in the competition which was founded by the French chef Paul Bocuse . Teams from 24 countries competed this year . “ I promised Monsieur Paul 10 years ago that we ’d make it to the top of the podium ” said the chef Thomas Keller who is the president of Team U. S. A. “ We made it in nine . ” The team ’s head chef was Mathew Peters 33 from Meadville Pa . who was most recently the executive of Mr. Keller ’s New York restaurant Per Se . His commis or helper was Harrison Turone 21 from Omaha who also worked at Per Se . Both of the chefs took a year off to prepare for the contest a fierce competition in which the American team is made up of younger chefs who can spare the time to train . Philip Tessier a member of the team that won second place in 2015 was the Americans ’ coach . This year the chefs were required to prepare a meat platter and a vegan dish in 5 hours 35 minutes . “ We had to use two proteins Bresse chicken and crayfish ” Mr. Peters said . “ And this was the first year there was a vegan dish . ” The teams were required to interpret “ Poulet de Bresse aux Écrevisses
" MOSCOW — Russian lawmakers on Wednesday moved to decriminalize some forms of domestic battery for offenders who do not do serious physical harm to their victims . Members of the State Duma passed the controversial amendment to the Russian criminal code in its second reading which essentially assures it will go to President Vladimir V. Putin for his signature . The amendment treats a first conviction for domestic battery as an administrative offense carrying a penalty of a $ 500 fine or 15 days in jail . If Mr. Putin signs the measure into law only injuries like concussions or broken bones or repeated offenses committed in a family setting would lead to criminal charges . Defenders of the measure say it will protect parents ’ rights to discipline their children and generally reduce the state ’s role in domestic life . “ In the traditional Russian family culture relations between ‘ fathers and sons ’ are built upon the authority of parents ’ power mutual love and personal indispensability as the basis for children ’s upbringing ” said Yelena B. Mizulina one of the initiators of the new legislation and author of a law that banned “ gay propaganda ” aimed at minors . Opponents called it a step back to medieval times and a license for violent behavior by domestic tyrants . “ It is clear that lawmakers recognized violence as a norm of family life ” said Svetlana G. Aivazova a Russian specialist in gender studies . “ This shows that Duma deputies are not simply conservative or traditional it shows that they are archaic . ” Ms. Aivazova and other experts say that Russia has a serious problem with domestic violence . Citing data provided by Russia ’s Interior Ministry Ms. Aivazova told Mr. Putin in 2015 that “ 40 percent of all grave violent crimes are committed in families . ” In 2013 she said more than 9000 women died in criminal assaults and more than 11000 were badly injured . In 2014 she said “ more than 25 percent of all murders were committed in families . ” In the United States by comparison
" Brent Musburger is calling it a career at ESPN after being the man in the booth at sporting events enjoyed by millions of Americans most prominently when he was the lead voice for CBS Sports in the 1980 s . Musburger who is 77 said he was leaving active sportscasting to help his family get a sports handicapping business started and to use some of the millions of airline miles he has earned for recreational travel . His last game will be the men ’s basketball game Tuesday night . That takes him back to Rupp Arena where he called Villanova ’s upset over Georgetown in the final of the N. C. A. A. tournament in 1985 . Musburger and ESPN said his comments about the Oklahoma football player Joe Mixon that were criticized as insensitive during the Sugar Bowl this month had nothing to do with his exit . On the broadcast Musburger said that he hoped Mixon who had been suspended for a year after punching a woman and breaking her jaw would make the most of his second chance . He did not initially talk about Mixon ’s victim . A former sportswriter Musburger ’s broadcast fame took off through his work on “ N. F. L. Today ” the pro football pregame show . He broadcast the N. B. A. college basketball the Masters golf tournament and tennis — most of CBS ’s marquee events . He was behind the mike for one of college football ’s most memorable plays Doug Flutie ’s “ Hail Mary ” pass that beat Miami for Boston College in 1984 . He confessed to Flutie later that it took him awhile to identify Gerard Phelan Flutie ’s roommate as the receiver of that pass — and Flutie told him he didn ’t know either until he had run off the field . Musburger was abruptly dropped by CBS in 1990 in what was perceived as a salary dump then went to work for ABC and ESPN . “ Brent made every event feel larger ” said Stephanie Druley ESPN senior vice president for events and studio production . “ To me there is probably not a greater storyteller as a person . He can spin a yarn like nobody else and it made games definitely more enjoyable to watch . ” Musburger ’s opportunities for national exposure grew more limited in recent years when ESPN assigned him to its SEC Network for college football . But he still called college basketball regularly

Craig Burke the publicity director at Penguin USA said that the publisher had ordered 75000 new copies of the book this week and that it was considering another reprint . “ We ’ve seen a big bump in sales ” Mr. Burke said . He added that the rise “ started over the weekend and hit hyperactive ” on Tuesday and Wednesday morning . Since Friday the book has reached a 9500 percent increase in sales he said . He said demand began to lift on Sunday shortly after the interview Kellyanne Conway an adviser to Donald J. Trump gave on “ Meet the Press . ” In defending a false claim by the White House press secretary Sean Spicer that Mr. Trump had attracted the “ largest audience ever to witness an inauguration ” Ms. Conway used a turn of phrase that struck some observers as similar to the dystopian world of “ 1984 . ” When asked on NBC ’s “ Meet the Press ” why Mr. Spicer had said something that was provably false Ms. Conway replied airily “ Don ’t be so dramatic . ” Mr. Spicer she said “ gave alternative facts . ” In the novel

Amtrak disconnected the board on Monday stretching tarpaulins over one side of the familiar sign that told commuters whether the 5:54 to Metuchen N.

Amtrak had said the departure board ’s demise would begin around 10 p. m. on Monday after the evening rush . For once Amtrak was early . By the time commuters arrived at 6 p. m. the board was off compounding the aggravation of a bad night caused by heavy winds and rain . Some commuters wondered if the board was related to the delays on New Jersey Transit which shares Penn Station with Amtrak and the Long Island Rail Road . An Amtrak spokeswoman Kimberly Woods said it was not . She said the board was turned off for testing and restarted before the final shutdown after 10 . As early as 3:37 p. m. New Jersey Transit had warned on Twitter that there would be “ major delays ” because a storm had knocked down power lines in Linden N. J.

" PHILADELPHIA — President Trump ’s decision to build a wall along the length of the United States ’ southern border with Mexico erupted into a diplomatic standoff on Thursday leading to the cancellation of a White House visit by Mexico ’s president and sharply rising tensions over who would pay for the wall . With the conflict escalating Mr. Trump appeared to embrace a proposal by House Republicans that would impose a 20 percent tax on all imported goods . The White House press secretary Sean Spicer told reporters that the proceeds would be used to pay for the border wall estimated to cost as much as $ 20 billion . But a furious uproar prompted Mr. Spicer to temper his earlier remarks saying the plan was simply “ one idea ” that might work to finance the wall . Mr. Spicer said it was not the job of the White House to “ roll something out ” on tax policy while Mr. Trump ’s chief of staff Reince Priebus said the administration was considering “ a buffet of options . ” If Mr. Trump does eventually announce his support for the tax plan it could have a broad impact on the American economy and its consumers and workers by sharply increasing the prices of imported goods or reducing profits for the companies that produce them . Other nations could retaliate prompting a trade war that could hit consumers around the globe . Retail businesses could see their tax bills surge said David French of the National Retail Federation who predicted that those costs would be passed on to consumers . He called the idea “ very counter to the way consumers are feeling at the moment . ” If nothing else the developments showed Mr. Trump that international diplomacy and a overhaul of the tax code would not be as easy as an announcement before a campaign microphone . The events unfolded after Mr. Trump signed an executive order on Wednesday to strengthen the nation ’s deportation force and start construction on a new wall along the border . Adding to Mexico ’s perception of an insult was the timing of the order : It came on the first day of talks between top Mexican officials and their counterparts in Washington and just days before a scheduled meeting between Mr. Trump and the Mexican president Enrique Peña Nieto . The sense of chaos and confusion about the tax issue added to the fallout from Mr. Trump ’s conflict with Mr. Peña Nieto his first direct clash with a world leader since becoming president a week ago . The Mexican peso bounced sharply with each new development . Tensions between the two have been simmering for months
" The White House floated an idea on Thursday afternoon that in initial reports sounded like a major tariff on Mexican imports — something that would have gone a long way toward unwinding one of the United States ’ deepest economic relationships . The reality of what Sean Spicer the press secretary suggested is a lot less dramatic . But it sends important signals about how people in the Trump administration are thinking about overhauling the tax code — and how they ’re thinking about claiming victory on some of the president ’s audacious campaign promises . It is a sign of just how fluid things are in this moment when so much of American public policy around taxes trade and diplomacy is in flux . Mr. Spicer suggested a way the administration could accomplish President Trump ’s goal of building a border wall paid for by Mexico . A 20 percent tax on imports from Mexico would do the trick Mr. Spicer said . That might sound as if Mr. Spicer was proposing that the United States slap a new tariff meant to punish Mexican exporters . Such a move would result in higher prices for American consumers create profound challenges for industries with supply chains that span the border and possibly prompt the collapse of the North American Free Trade Agreement . But you get a different picture when you put Mr. Spicer ’s words into the context of the rapidly evolving debate in Washington around overhauling corporate taxation . He was pointing out that in an overhaul of taxes that House Republicans are considering imports from all countries would be taxed at 20 percent while American exports would be tax free . It ’s called border adjustment and it would make the United States corporate tax code more closely resemble the tax that is commonplace in other countries . House Republicans see the policy as a way to reshape the tax code to give businesses less incentive to move operations overseas while also generating revenue they can use to reduce tax rates . Opponents of the plan which include major retailers are skeptical . Among the risks : It could drive up consumer prices for all sorts of imported goods from German cars to Mexican avocados if the dollar does not rise as much as economists predict . And the policy may violate World Trade Organization rules which could tangle it up in legal proceedings . But that Mr. Spicer was floating that plan as a way to fulfill Mr. Trump ’s Mexican wall promises is interesting on two levels . First less than two weeks ago the threw cold water on the House plan . “ Anytime I hear border adjustment I don ’t love it ” Mr. Trump told The Wall Street Journal . “ Because usually it means we ’re going to get adjusted into a bad deal . ” On Thursday Mr. Spicer was explicitly suggesting that a border tax could be used to pay for a border wall . Referring to the tax plan
" MEXICO CITY — President Donald J. Trump ’s decision to build a wall along the southern border escalated into a diplomatic standoff on Thursday with Mexico ’s president publicly canceling a scheduled meeting at the White House and Mr. Trump firing back accusing Mexico of burdening the United States with illegal immigrants criminals and a trade deficit . Mr. Trump ’s push to fulfill his campaign pledge and build a border wall brought to a head months of simmering tensions culminating in a remarkable between the two leaders . By afternoon Mr. Trump ’s spokesman said the president would pay for the border wall by imposing a 20 percent tax on imports to the United States which he said would raise billions of dollars . The sparring began Thursday morning when the president of Mexico announced on Twitter that he was canceling his meeting with Mr. Trump next week rejecting the visit after the new American leader ordered the border wall between the two nations . Having called for dialogue in the face of Mr. Trump ’s vows to build a wall during the American presidential campaign President Enrique Peña Nieto ultimately bowed to public pressure in Mexico to respond more forcefully to his northern neighbor . On Wednesday Mr. Trump signed an executive order to beef up the nation ’s deportation force and start construction on a new wall along the border . Adding to the perceived insult was the timing of the order : It came on the first day of talks between top Mexican officials and their counterparts in Washington and just days before the meeting between the two presidents . Mr. Trump ’s action was enough to prompt Mr. Peña Nieto to start discussing whether to scrap his plans to visit the White House according to Mexican officials . In a video message delivered over Twitter on Wednesday night Mr. Peña Nieto reiterated his commitment to protect the interests of Mexico and the Mexican people and he chided the move in Washington to continue with the wall . “ I regret and condemn the United States ’ decision to continue with the construction of a wall that for years now far from uniting us divides us ” he said . Then on Thursday morning Mr. Trump fired back warning that he might cancel the meeting himself if Mexico did not agree to pay for the wall . Just before Mr. Trump fired off his Twitter post the Mexican foreign minister and Mr. Trump ’s Homeland Security secretary
" WASHINGTON — With Twitter posts leaks and executive orders President Trump is moving quickly to show he will make good on some of his key campaign pledges . Within a period this week he ordered or signaled significant new policies on border security terrorism crime and voting . But as Mr. Trump ’s predecessor learned in 2009 when he ordered the military prison at Guantánamo Bay closed implementing policy is not as easy as the stroke of a pen . Details to carry out security policies exceed Twitter ’s limit and in some cases the public can only infer Mr. Trump ’s plans . Here is what he has promised and what authority he has to carry it out . No political promise came to symbolize Mr. Trump ’s candidacy like his pledge to build a wall between the United States and Mexico . The costs and logistical headaches of such a project — which would cut through private property — have always been daunting but Mr. Trump ’s supporters were unfazed : “ Build the wall ! ” they chanted . On Wednesday Mr. Trump signed an order to build it and announced that work would begin immediately on a project that is estimated to cost more than $ 20 billion . He offered few details including any that would address the fact that Congress not the White House writes the checks . The Antideficiency Act prohibits the government from spending money for any reason that Congress has not appropriated . The president can announce whatever plans he wants . But whether the plan is “ build a wall ” or “ close Guantánamo ” if Congress does not go along it can amount to wishful thinking . As one Republican lawmaker said of Mr. Obama ’s 2009 order on Guantánamo “ This is an executive order that places hope ahead of reality . ” Mr. Trump a real estate developer by trade seemed undeterred . “ We do not need new laws ” he said Wednesday . “ We will work within the existing system and framework . ” While that appeared to mean that he intended to shift some already appropriated money to the wall ’s construction it was unclear where the funds would come from . He cannot easily cannibalize one program to pay for the wall . “ It doesn ’t work out like that
" WASHINGTON — Just days after President Trump spoke of a “ running war ’ ’ with the media his chief White House strategist Stephen K. Bannon ratcheted up the attacks arguing that news organizations had been “ humiliated ” by the election outcome and repeatedly describing the media as “ the opposition party ” of the current administration . “ The media should be embarrassed and humiliated and keep its mouth shut and just listen for a while ” Mr. Bannon said in an interview on Wednesday . “ I want you to quote this ” Mr. Bannon added . “ The media here is the opposition party . They don ’t understand this country . They still do not understand why Donald Trump is the president of the United States . ” The scathing assessment — delivered by one of Mr. Trump ’s most trusted and influential advisers in the first days of his presidency — comes at a moment of high tension between the news media and the administration with skirmishes over the size of Mr. Trump ’s inaugural crowd and the president ’s false claims that millions of illegal votes by undocumented immigrants swayed the popular vote against him . Mr. Bannon who rarely grants interviews to journalists outside of Breitbart News the provocative website he ran until August was echoing comments by Mr. Trump last weekend when the president said he was in “ a running war ” with the media and called journalists “ among the most dishonest people on earth . ” Mr. Bannon ’s remarks added to the growing acrimony between the press and a president who made attacks on the media a rallying point of his election campaign . Among Mr. Trump ’s advisers in the White House Mr. Bannon is responsible for putting into action the nationalist vision that Mr. Trump channeled during the later months of the campaign one that stemmed from Mr. Bannon himself . And in many ways Mr. Trump has acted on that vision during his first week in office — from the description of “ American carnage ” he laid out in his inauguration speech to a series of executive actions outlining policies on trade agreements immigration and the building of a border wall . Mr. Bannon is one of the strongest forces in an administration with competing power centers . A savvy manipulator of the press and a proud provocateur he was among the few advisers in Mr. Trump ’s circle who were said to have urged Sean Spicer the new press secretary to give a confrontational emotional statement to a shocked West Wing briefing room on Saturday
" PHILADELPHIA — From the time Donald J. Trump became their candidate until he took the oath of office congressional Republicans treated his policy pronouncements — largely out of step with Republican dogma — as essentially a distraction . He would talk . They would drive the policies . But now the question of whether congressional Republicans would change President Trump or Mr. Trump would change them has an early answer . Mr. Trump cheerfully addressed the group here at their policy retreat on Thursday and they responded with applause to many proposals they have long opposed . Republican lawmakers appear more than ready to open up the coffers for a $ 12 billion to $ 15 billion border wall perhaps without the commensurate spending cuts that they demanded when it came to disaster aid money to fight the Zika virus or funds for the tainted water system in Flint Mich . They also seem to back a swelling of the federal payroll that Mr. Trump has called for in the form of a larger military and 5000 more border patrol agents . They have stayed oddly silent as Mr. Trump and Senate Democrats push a $ 1 trillion infrastructure plan larger than one they rejected from President Barack Obama . Once fierce promoters of the separation of powers Republicans are now embracing Mr. Trump ’s early governing by executive order something they loudly decried during Mr. Obama ’s second term . Speaker Paul D. Ryan whose own website this week still praised the Partnership trade deal now applauds Mr. Trump for putting the final shovel of dirt over the accord with the president saying he is interested in bilateral agreements instead . Many Republicans who have been longstanding opponents of Russia and written laws that prohibit torture have chosen to overlook or even concur with Mr. Trump ’s embrace of both . Even on the subject of Mr. Trump ’s call for an investigation into voter fraud a widely debunked claim Republicans have often demurred . “ The notion that election fraud is a fiction is not true ” said the Senate majority leader
" ■ President Trump at a political gathering of congressional Republicans asks “ Where ’s my C. I. A. director ? ” ■ A new Quinnipiac University poll put President Trump ’s approval rating at 36 percent compared to Barack Obama ’s 59 percent in the opening weeks of his presidency . ■ The professional golfer Bernhard Langer released a statement saying he never told President Trump a story of voter fraud that Mr. Trump relayed to congressional leaders . President Trump may be unaware that America ’s spy chiefs are not supposed to be creatures of partisan politics . Speaking on Thursday in Philadelphia at an annual retreat for Republican lawmakers Mr. Trump seemed to think Mike Pompeo the new director of the Central Intelligence Agency would be among the senators representatives and party operatives hooting and hollering in the crowd . “ Where is Pompeo ? Where the hell is he ? ” Mr. Trump said scanning the crowd . The answer in case Mr. Trump has not yet figured it out : Mr. Pompeo was not in Philadelphia . The C. I. A. like the military is supposed to be apolitical and its chief does not have a direct role in creating administration policies . Though Mr. Pompeo has attended the Republican retreat in years past — he was a Republican representative before taking over the C. I. A. on Monday — it would be considered highly inappropriate for him to take part in his new role running the country ’s premier intelligence agency . It was not the first time that Mr. Trump appeared to mix partisan politics and C. I. A business . He accused the C. I. A. ’s previous leadership of playing politics after American intelligence agencies said they believed that Russia tried to help him win the election . Then on Saturday he gave a speech at C. I. A. headquarters that was filled with campaign trail rhetoric . The speech was widely criticized by former C. I. A. officials from both Republican and Democratic administrations . But Mr. Trump in an interview on Wednesday with ABC News cast the visit to C. I. A. as a highlight of his first days in office . “ That speech was a home run ” he said . “ I got a standing ovation . In fact they said it was the biggest standing ovation since Peyton Manning had won the Super Bowl and they said it was equal . I got a standing ovation . It lasted for a long period of time . ” President Trump
" Janet Napolitano president of the University of California knows exactly what ’s at stake if President Trump shuts down an Obama administration program that has given work permits and protection from deportation to some 752000 young undocumented immigrants . In 2012 in her previous job as secretary of Homeland Security she signed the document — nothing more than a policy memo — that created the program . So when alarm spread among immigrants on college campuses following Mr. Trump ’s election Ms. Napolitano moved quickly to determine what the California system could do to shelter its students if he carried through on his pledges to cancel the program Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals . The university estimates that almost 3800 among its 190000 students are undocumented many but not all with DACA . Ms. Napolitano retaining her law enforcement instincts does not mention the word “ sanctuary ” when describing what the university could offer . “ Sanctuary is such a vague term we don ’t use it ” she said crisply . Instead the university has published detailed principles of support for undocumented students including assurances that campus police would not question students solely about their immigration status or join any cooperation agreements with federal immigration authorities under the Trump administration . Through the Davis campus law school the university is organizing legal help for students detained for deportation . Another worrisome prospect Ms. Napolitano said is that students could lose the permits that allow them to work . Undocumented students including any losing DACA
" Words matter . And from the moment he became president Donald J. Trump has unleashed so many of consequence that the public has barely had time to parse their full implication . Words about the dishonest media the end of Obamacare the construction of that border wall with Mexico — this is an abbreviated list and he hasn ’t even completed his first week in office . Amid the verbal deluge President Trump this week repeated an assertion he made shortly after his election : that millions of ballots cast illegally by undocumented immigrants cost him the popular vote . If true this would suggest the wholesale corruption of American democracy . Not to worry : As far as anyone knows the president ’s assertion is akin to saying that millions of unicorns also voted illegally . But such a baseless statement by a president challenged the news media to find the precise words to describe it . This will be a recurring challenge given President Trump ’s habit of speaking in hyperbole and his tendency to deride any report as “ fake news . ” The words needed to be exactly right . “ And the language has a rich vocabulary for describing statements that fall short of the truth ” said Geoffrey Nunberg a linguist who teaches at the University of California Berkeley School of Information . “ They ’re ‘ baseless ’ they ’re ‘ bogus ’ they ’re ‘ lies ’ they ’re ‘ untruths . ’ ” Rarely are these words each with its own nuance applied directly to something said by a president though others have also dissembled ( like Bill Clinton on whether he had sex with an intern ) . “ This is the very unique situation that we find ourselves in as journalists and as a country ” said Joshua Benton
" There isn ’t any evidence to support President Trump ’s assertion that three to five million illegal votes were cast in the 2016 presidential election . But there is one study that has been interpreted to suggest it is at least possible . It found that between 32000 and 2. 8 million noncitizen voters might have fraudulently cast ballots in the 2008 presidential election . The study based on a survey of 38000 people after that election has been under fire since it was published in 2014 . Now even its authors concede that it probably overstated the amount of noncitizen voting . “ The estimates are likely incorrect ” Jesse Richman one of the of the study and a political science professor at Old Dominion University said in an email exchange on Wednesday . In a post online he also said that the findings do not support Mr. Trump ’s contention that millions cast ballots illegally . Mr. Richman still maintains that some small percentage of noncitizens vote in American elections . But the debate over this study has moved on . It ’s no longer about whether millions of illegal votes were cast but whether there ’s any evidence for noncitizen voting at all . The study ’s bold claims fell apart because of something called response error : the possibility that people taking a survey don ’t answer a question correctly — in this case a question about being American citizens . There is always a tiny amount of response error in surveys . Respondents might not understand the question . Or they might understand it but mark the wrong answer by mistake if the survey is . An interviewer if there is one could accidentally record the wrong answer . Such errors usually aren ’t a problem large enough to change the results of a survey . But both the survey and the question posed by researchers were unusual . The survey — the Cooperative Congressional Election Study — was huge with 38000 respondents in 2008 . And the group in question — noncitizens — was very small just 339 of those respondents . The problem is that even a tiny amount of response error among the 38000 respondents could have been enough to contaminate the results of the tiny group of noncitizens . Imagine for instance
" LONDON — As American allies across Europe and Asia brace for President Trump Britain stands out for the degree to which it is proceeding as if little has changed . The country consumed with managing “ Brexit ” and its associated domestic political dramas appears to have taken relatively few steps to prepare for the geopolitical earthquakes that Mr. Trump could bring to the international and European orders on which Britain relies and that his proposals would undermine . “ The people at the top of our system whether they ’re politicians or officials or journalists or think tankers like me we ’re all totally focused on Brexit ” said Charles Grant who heads the Center for European Reform . “ We haven ’t thought about Trump as much as we should have . ” It is possible that Prime Minister Theresa May by throwing in her lot with Mr. Trump could ride out any changes to the international order . But if that approach does not succeed it could have severe consequences both for her nation and for the world that Britain plays a role in keeping together . Mrs. May has sought to win over Mr. Trump whom she will visit this week just as her European counterparts are exploring more fundamental questions about American reliability . “ The British debate on Trump is over very trivial stuff like who Trump spoke to before May and the German debate is over the future of the liberal order in the West ” said Mark Leonard the director of the European Council on Foreign Relations . Steinmeier the German foreign minister wrote in a column this week for the German newspaper Bild that with Mr. Trump ’s election
" In the world according to President Trump the United States and Britain are about to make their special relationship great again . Having cast off decades of global niceties — the United States by putting him in the White House Britain by voting to leave the European Union — they can now forge a magnificent future . Mr. Trump is readying proof . As he prepares to host Prime Minister Theresa May of Britain at the White House on Friday he intends to begin discussions on a agreement that would deepen commercial ties between their countries . A trade agreement would make for useful political theater on both sides of the Atlantic particularly as President Barack Obama had pointedly warned that a deal would not easily happen . But as a spur to economic expansion and hiring a deal would almost certainly amount to very little . Until Britain actually leaves Europe — a step most likely at least two years away — it is legally barred from entering a trade agreement with any country . If a deal was quietly negotiated to take effect after Britain ’s departure its economic punch would probably be modest . Tariffs between the countries are already minimal meaning there are relatively few trade impediments left to clear away . What areas of business could be opened to increased competition tend to be the most politically sensitive : agriculture government procurement and defense . Legions of lobbyists would mount ferocious battles to preserve the privileges of industries . American federal government contracts would attract keen interest from British defense and aerospace companies especially as Mr. Trump has vowed to rebuild the military . But opening such business to foreign competitors in a trade agreement would directly collide with Mr. Trump ’s “ America First ” mantra . “ If President Trump genuinely means ‘ buy American hire American ’ above all else then there ’s going to be very little left to offer other countries ” said Adam S. Posen a former member of the committee at the Bank of England and now president of the Peterson Institute for International Economics in Washington . “ There is no way in hell this is a massive trade deal . It would take massive effort to create a trade deal of even minimal effect . ” Trade it is worth noting tends to involve . Negotiations are politically fraught because they expose domestic industries to the prospect of greater competition with overseas companies . In exchange domestic consumers gain access to more and cheaper products . British steak aficionados may cheer the shrinking of steep tariffs that limit the influx of American beef . The British beef industry would probably respond less enthusiastically . It would seek protection particularly as Britain ’s exit from the bloc would eliminate European subsidies for British agriculture . Any proposed opening of agriculture would probaly provoke British opposition to genetically modified crops . British insurance companies may be eager for a greater crack at the enormous American market but that would be outside the scope of a potential deal . In the United States
" WASHINGTON — Vice President Mike Pence will speak on Friday to a gathering of activists on the National Mall a sign of the movement ’s new and growing authority in a government now dominated by Republicans . The organizers for the event the March for Life had extended invitations to President Trump and Mr. Pence . A senior White House official confirmed that Mr. Pence would address the marchers . Mr. Pence ’s appearance will come just a few days before Mr. Trump is expected to reveal his nominee for the Supreme Court seat left vacant by the death of Justice Antonin Scalia last year . Mr. Trump has said his pick like Mr. Scalia would oppose abortion rights one of several promises he has made to roll back legal protections for the procedure . Other Republican presidents including Ronald Reagan and George W. Bush have spoken to the march but remotely . leaders see the Trump administration ’s commitment to their cause and the looming Supreme Court nomination battle as a tipping point after eight years of a Democratic administration . The symbolism of hearing from Mr. Pence and another senior Trump administration official Kellyanne Conway at the march is hard to overlook . Mr. Trump eventually won over many reluctant leaders who had chafed at his past support for abortion rights and his history of being a role model for religious conservatives . Mr. Trump ’s pledges to them which he made in writing before the election have gone a long way to rebuilding trust . activists say they are among the most detailed and serious pledges a president has made to their cause . They include a vow to sign a nationwide ban on abortion at 20 weeks of pregnancy and a commitment to ensuring that his Supreme Court appointments are against the procedure . "
" WASHINGTON — When President Obama relied heavily on executive orders to push through policies that had no chance in Congress Republicans called him a dictator who abused his power and disregarded the Constitution . They even took him to court . “ We have an increasingly lawless presidency where he is actually doing the job of Congress writing new policies and laws without going through Congress ” Representative Paul D. Ryan then the Budget Committee chairman said in a 2014 television interview after Mr. Obama made clear in his State of the Union address that he would readily take unilateral action to get his way . Now President Trump at the start of his tenure is relying heavily on executive actions not just to reverse Obama administration initiatives but to enact new federal policies covering immigration health care and other areas in ways that could be seen more as the province of the House and Senate . And he is doing that with clear Republican majorities in Congress . The flurry of administration edicts flowing from the Trump White House puts some top Republicans in the awkward position of welcoming aggressive executive muscle flexing from a president of their own party after castigating Mr. Obama for using the same approach . Their rationale : Mr. Obama took executive action too far stretching the intent of legislation to fulfill an ideological agenda . “ We ’ve never been against executive action ” said Ashlee Strong a spokeswoman for Mr. Ryan now the House speaker . “ We ’re against overreaching illegal action . ” Mr. Trump ’s eager embrace of the executive order — he signaled clearly during his campaign that he intended to follow his predecessor ’s lead — allows him to claim immediate progress on his campaign promises rather than waiting for a lengthy legislative process to play out . Many of his major proposals — building a border wall hiring more border and immigration officers creating a new office for victims of crimes committed by immigrants in the country illegally — will presumably require funding by Congress and that is no certainty in the current political environment . The question then becomes how Mr. Trump would proceed if Congress balks . House Republicans are currently suing the executive branch — and winning — in a case that argues the Obama administration spent more than $ 13 billion on health insurance subsidies without necessary congressional approval in a clear breach of the Constitution . The health care executive order issued by Mr. Trump last week directed federal officials to find ways to minimize the financial burden of the health care law on governments health care providers and others . Many saw the move as a backdoor attempt by the new White House to undermine the current law of the land while Republicans try to figure out a way to repeal it . It was the reverse of the type of action Republicans criticized President Obama for — using his executive powers to prop up the health care law without sufficient authority . But there were no loud complaints from Republicans this time a fact not lost on Democrats . “ Congressional Republicans ’ hypocritical acquiescence to President Trump ’s executive orders is an abdication of their responsibility to govern especially in light of their vocal opposition to even the most restrained use of executive authority by President Obama
" President Trump has carried his Twitter habit into his presidency . He has also brought with him another tech habit that is causing concern . Mr. Trump has been using his old unsecured Android phone to post on Twitter since moving to Washington late last week . The president ’s desire to use his old personal smartphone raises concerns that its use could be exposing him and the nation to security threats . He is using the Android smartphone mainly to post on Twitter not to make calls . But it ’s unclear what security measures have been put in place on the device and how vulnerable he could be to someone stealing data or breaking into his Twitter account . The White House did not respond to a request for comment . Twitter requires a connection to the internet which exposes the device to security vulnerabilities if proper measures like authentication — a password and a code texted to a phone for example — are not in place . If he uses the smartphone on an unsecure network he could be exposing his location and other personal information on the device . “ The absolutely minimum Trump could do to protect our nation is to use a secure device to protect him from foreign spies and other threats ” said Senator Ron Wyden a Democrat from Oregon on the Intelligence Committee . “ It would be irresponsible in the extreme for the commander in chief to use an unsecure device that could be easily hacked or intercepted . ” Among the concerns by security experts : ■ It is unclear if the device and its functions like texting are encrypted to thwart hacking . ■ The device could be more vulnerable to hacking if used on unsecured and cellular networks such as when Mr. Trump travels between meetings or anywhere outside the White House . ■ Hackers could access the device to turn on the camera and microphone . ■ Stingray devices a type of surveillance tool often used by law enforcement can track a device ’s location and other information . “ There are a lot of questions but it is clear there are often vulnerabilities in our phones and internet systems — and it is critical that people take precautions to ensure their sensitive information is protected from hackers and other malicious actors ” said Neema Singh Guliani legislative counsel with the American Civil Liberties Union . The president ’s use of the personal device is particularly notable given his criticism of Hillary Clinton for using a personal email address and server when she was secretary of state . In 2009 President Barack Obama fought to become the first president with a smartphone though he won the use of a White secure device came with many rules . “ As president he is the biggest sitting target in the world ” said Kevin Bankston the director of New America ’s Open Technology Institute .

" ( Want to get this briefing by email ? Here ’s the . ) Good evening . Here ’s the latest . 1. President Trump ’s aggressive moves on security and immigration drew strong responses both domestically and internationally . Tensions with Mexico are particularly high . Its president Enrique Peña Nieto above canceled a meeting with Mr. Trump and the two feuded — largely over Twitter — as reports emerged that Mr. Trump could consider a 20 percent tax on imports to pay for a border wall . Mexico said its 50 consulates in the United States would work to protect the rights of Mexican immigrants while America ’s sanctuary cities including New York Boston and Los Angeles vowed to resist immigration enforcement . _____ 2. Mr. Trump told Republican leaders at a policy retreat in Philadelphia that this Congress would be the busiest “ in decades maybe ever . ” His adviser Steve Bannon deepened tensions with the news media saying it had been humiliated by election missteps and should “ keep its mouth shut . ” He added : “ I want you to quote this . The media here is the opposition party . ” This may not come as a surprise : Sales of dystopian novels most notably George Orwell ’s “ 1984 ” are spiking . Our literary critic offers a reappraisal . The Times is tracking Mr. Trump ’s full agenda and covering many more aspects of his administration . You can also sign up for our daily politics newsletter here . _____ 3. Vice President Mike Pence will speak at the March for Life on the National Mall on Friday . Organizers have ramped up attendance efforts not wanting to be embarrassed by a poorer turnout than the women ’s marches last weekend . And health clinics across the developing world are bracing for cuts because of Mr. Trump ’s revival of a policy prohibiting foreign aid to groups that discuss abortion a rule that often curtails broader health services . Above a woman who suffered complications from a botched abortion in the Democratic Republic of Congo . _____ 4. The Doomsday Clock has moved nearer to midnight than it ’s been in more than 60 years . Devised by the nonprofit Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists it ’s meant to convey “ how close we are to destroying our civilization with dangerous technologies of our own making . ” It debuted in 1947 . Two of the group ’s scientists cited alarm over Mr. Trump ’s positions on nuclear weapons and climate change . _____ 5. In China hundreds of millions of people are traveling from industrial regions to their hometowns to celebrate the start of Lunar New Year on Saturday . Some cities have restricted the use of fireworks over pollution concerns . _____ 6. For the first time biologists have succeeded in growing human stem cells in pig embryos . The advance brings scientists closer to developing human organs in animals for later transplant . Since the organ would be made of a patient ’s own cells
" The election of Donald Trump and the accompanying rehabilitation of fossil fuels should have been by all rights devastating for Tesla Motors . Tesla is the top maker of autos and it completed its merger with SolarCity a leading manufacturer of solar energy panels days after the presidential election . Elon Musk the visionary founder of both companies openly criticized Mr. Trump ’s candidacy saying on CNBC just before the vote that he was “ not the right guy ” for the job . Mr. Musk has pressed for a carbon tax to combat global warming which Mr. Trump once dismissed as a Chinese hoax . The mere mention of a carbon tax inflames the old guard of the energy industry . Moreover both Tesla and SolarCity benefit from federal subsidies . Robert E. Murray a coal executive and Trump supporter has called Mr. Musk “ a fraud ” for accepting $ 2 billion in government handouts . So why have Tesla shares surged since Mr. Trump ’s election closing this week within striking distance of a record high ? Adam Jonas a prominent automotive analyst at Morgan Stanley upgraded Tesla stock to overweight last week with a target price of $ 305 a share . ( It was trading this week at about $ 255 . ) “ When you look at the businesses Tesla is in you see many areas of overlapping interest ” with the Trump administration Mr. Jonas told me . “ To the extent the new administration prioritizes the creation of valuable innovative high tech and manufacturing jobs
" Rosanne Bloom and her family had just settled into their seats on a flight from Philadelphia to Turks and Caicos Islands on Christmas morning when two airline employees ordered Dr. Bloom her husband and two boys off the plane . Their luggage had already been removed . The problem ? Dr. Bloom had informed the crew that her teenage sons had severe nut allergies . “ I said ‘ We have our medicine . We brought our own food and we ’re comfortable staying on the plane . ’ I offered to sign a waiver ” said Dr. Bloom an orthodontist in Clarksville Md . “ We were off the plane in two minutes . ” Matt Miller a spokesman for American Airlines said such decisions are left to the pilot . “ The pilot determined it would be best for the family not to travel based on the severity of the allergy and the need to divert the airline if anyone were eating nuts ” he said . Airline carriers have a long tradition of serving peanuts on flights and often serve little else . But the practice also presents a challenge to travelers with severe nut allergies who can suffer a reaction simply by touching a surface that has been exposed to nuts . But tensions between passengers with food allergies and airline staff members have risen in recent years as airlines have begun to enforce stricter rules related to preboarding passengers . In the past parents of young children could board the plane early giving them a chance to wipe down seats trays and armrests to reduce exposure to allergens . But today many airlines have stopped letting families with children board before other passengers . When families request permission to preboard — or pose another request such as asking whether nuts will be served — they risk being taken off the flight or threatened with removal said Mary Vargas a lawyer whose family was almost kept off a plane from London back to the United States in December because of a nut allergy . Now families with nut allergies are waging a legal challenge against such policies . Two formal complaints filed with the Department of Transportation in the last month accuse American Airlines of discrimination against passengers with allergies . The complaints cite the airline ’s preboarding policy which prohibits preboarding specifically for people with allergies and not for others . “ This is about being allowed to fly like everybody else in the United States
" BEIJING — Xu Zhengming was lugging a television through the Beijing West Railway Station on his way home for China ’s Lunar New Year . Another passenger was hauling a tub of meat . And many migrant workers returning to their home villages carried bundles of clothes and gifts for children they see maybe once a year . They all said that they could not go home for China ’s biggest holiday . Even if that meant carting a television for two days across 1000 miles . “ I get to go back just once a year . It ’s a long way ” Mr. Xu said as he heaved the television bundled in protective clothing through the railway station . He was headed to a village outside Chengdu the capital of the southwestern province of Sichuan a journey he estimated would take about 20 hours . “ My father is in the countryside and the family is hard up ” said Mr. Xu a construction laborer in Beijing the Chinese capital . “ He always wanted a television so I ’m taking mine home to give him . ” He and most other passengers at this cavernous thrumming station were among hundreds of millions of Chinese on the move for the Lunar New Year . Many wore red hats or scarves the color of good luck . While the total number of holiday travelers is hard to pin down this is the world ’s largest annual migration . Zhang Kemin a restaurant worker dragging a plastic tub holding about 18 pounds of beef and lamb said he was taking the meat home to Hebei Province adjacent to Beijing to make boiled dumplings filled with a mix of meat and vegetables an essential part of the holiday food in northern China . “ There ’s pork at home ” he explained . In the days before the holiday
" HAENGCHI VILLAGE South Korea — Each day hundreds of visitors many with young children make a pilgrimage to Haengchi Village where Ban was born 72 years ago . They wander through a replica of Mr. Ban ’s old house . They learn about his personal journey to the United Nations where he was secretary general for 10 years . Despite criticism of his tenure there Mr. Ban is seen as a role model by vast numbers of South Koreans . School textbooks for example celebrate him as a “ man who made South Korea proud . ” And many South Koreans want Mr. Ban to be their next president succeeding Park whom the National Assembly voted to impeach last month on corruption charges . When Mr. Ban arrived home on Jan. 12 crowds of turned out at the airport waving flags and shouting “ Ban please save this country ! ” Yet there is also deep skepticism about his potential presidential bid especially among the nation ’s progressives . They say he is trying to be part of the establishment yet against it at the same time — a “ Mr. ” in the words of critics . ( The word “ ban ” in Korean means “ half . ” ) Mr. Ban calls himself “ a child of the United Nations ” part of a generation of South Koreans who remembered United Nations handouts in the destitute years after the Korean War as well as United Nations Forces who fought in the war . Many of his contemporaries view the United States as South Korea ’s savior and protector . “ I am ready to give my all to uniting the divided country and making South Korea a nation ” Mr. Ban said . “ As United Nations secretary general I have seen why some nations prosper and why some fail . ” His advocates say he is a seasoned diplomat who can best deal with both North Korea ’s advancing nuclear weapons program and President Trump who has raised questions about Washington ’s trade and defense commitments to its allies . One of the first things Mr. Ban did after his homecoming was support the deployment of an American missile defense system that has angered North Korea and China . Critics say his place in the establishment makes him unsuitable as a figure who can restore trust in government . They believe the political class has been disgraced by Ms. Park ’s corruption scandal and yet is also desperate for a candidate it can support in an election that could take place as early as this spring . The Constitutional Court is expected to rule in the coming weeks whether Ms. Park should be formally unseated . As Mr. Ban crisscrossed the country after his return paying homage to the dead at national cemeteries and shaking hands with street vendors
" SEOUL South Korea — The defector from North Korea in years said on Wednesday that the days of the country ’s leadership were “ numbered ” and that its attempts to control outside information were not working because of corruption and discontent . “ I am sure that more defections of my colleagues will take place since North Korea is already on a slippery slope ” the defector Thae said during a news conference in Seoul the capital of South Korea . “ The traditional structures of the North Korean system are crumbling . ” Mr. Thae had been the North ’s No. 2 diplomat in London until he fled to the South last summer with his family . South Korea has hailed his defection as a sign of growing disillusionment among North Korean elites with the country ’s leader Kim . Since December Mr. Thae has given a series of interviews to share his dire view of today ’s North Korea . Mr. Thae ’s diagnosis of Mr. Kim ’s rule is hardly new . Defectors from the North as well as some conservative analysts and policy makers in the South widely share that view . Still it signaled a drastic change of roles for Mr. Thae . Before his defection he was a career diplomat fluent in English who had served in Britain Denmark and Sweden often delivering passionate speeches glorifying the Kim family that has ruled North Korea for seven decades . In the South Mr. Thae now affiliated with the Institute for National Security Strategy a think tank arm of the National Intelligence Service has vowed to spend the rest of his life trying to bring down the North Korean government . Mr. Thae said he had high expectations when Mr. Kim took power after the death of his father
" The conservative radio host Glenn Beck called the Women ’s March in Washington an “ AstroTurf ” rally funded by the liberal billionaire George Soros . He complained that the news media refused to acknowledge this fact . But there ’s one news organization he praised as an exception : The New York Times . As evidence he pointed to a piece by Asra Q. Nomani a liberal feminist and Trump voter who claimed to document the extensive financial ties Soros had to march partners . The conservative website Breitbart News tied the piece to The Times in a prominent headline . And the site The Daily Stormer wrote about the piece under a headline that referred to Soros as an “ International Jew . ” Suddenly The Times was a crowd pleaser . Only it wasn ’t The Times that ran this article . It was published on a site affiliated with The Times — but completely distinct from the paper — called Women in the World . The site is part of an events organization founded by Tina Brown ( of The Daily Beast and The New Yorker fame ) . The Times is a business investor in Women in the World and provides the website ’s digital platform but the two have separate editorial operations . None of that was apparent to many readers who wrote in confused about whether the story was the work of The Times . Here ’s one from Susan Kruglinski of New York : It ’s easy to be confused . I was . At the top left corner of the website for example there is the familiar “ T ” logo of The New York Times and the URL has “ nytimes ” in it . Click the stylized “ T ” and you ’ll be taken to The Times ’s website . If you scroll to the very bottom of the Women in the World home page squint to find the “ About Us ” link and click you ’ll be taken to a page that in the fourth paragraph explains the relationship between The Times and Women in the World . For the most part the site publishes news and features about women that don ’t seem particularly controversial . This one which was labeled Opinion was more ideologically charged and made The Times the perfect foil for conservative news sites . Adam Bryant who oversees the newsroom ’s role in conferences was sympathetic to the idea that something more might need to be done to make evident the degree to which the two organizations are separate . “ As part of the The New York Times ’s business relationship with Women in the World we currently provide the digital platform for them

" LaGRANGE Ga . — Some people here had never heard about the lynching of Austin Callaway — about how almost 77 years ago he was dragged out of a jail cell by a band of masked white men then shot and left for dead . Some people never forgot . But on Thursday evening the fatal cruelties inflicted upon Mr. Callaway — long obscured by time fear professional malfeasance and a reluctance to investigate the sins of the past — were acknowledged in this city of 31000 people when LaGrange ’s police chief Louis M. Dekmar who is white issued a rare apology for a Southern lynching . “ I sincerely regret and denounce the role our Police Department played in Austin ’s lynching both through our action and our inaction ” Chief Dekmar told a crowd at a traditionally church . “ And for that I ’m profoundly sorry . It should never have happened . ” He also said that all citizens had the right to expect that their police department “ be honest decent unbiased and ethical . ” “ In Austin ’s case and in many like his those were not the police department values he experienced ” he said . The apology for the Sept. 8
" For the first time biologists have succeeded in growing human stem cells in pig embryos shifting from science fiction to the realm of the possible the idea of developing human organs in animals for later transplant . The approach involves generating stem cells from a patient ’s skin growing the desired new organ in a large animal like a pig and then harvesting it for transplant into the patient ’s body . Since the organ would be made of a patient ’s own cells there would be little risk of immune rejection . The pigs would be examples of chimeras animals composed of two different genomes . They would be generated by implanting human stem cells into an early pig embryo resulting in an animal composed of mixed pig and human cells . One team of biologists led by Jun Wu and Juan Carlos Izpisua Belmonte at the Salk Institute has shown for the first time that human stem cells can contribute to forming the tissues of a pig despite the 90 million years of evolution between the two species . Another group headed by Tomoyuki Yamaguchi and Hideyuki Sato of the University of Tokyo and Hiromitsu Nakauchi of Stanford has reversed diabetes in mice by inserting pancreas glands composed of mouse cells that were grown in a rat . The Salk team ’s report is published in Thursday ’s issue of Cell and the team ’s in Wednesday ’s issue of Nature . The two reports together establish the feasibility of trying to grow replacement human organs in animals though such a goal is still far off . “ I think this is very promising work in principle ” said Rudolf Jaenisch a stem cell expert at the Whitehead Institute in Cambridge Mass . Many technical and ethical barriers have yet to be overcome but the research is advancing alongside the acute need for organs some 76000 people in the United States alone are awaiting transplants . Creating chimeras especially those with human cells
" MELBOURNE Australia — The sibling rivalry at least on the tennis tour started right here at the Australian Open for the Williams sisters . It was 1998 and older sister Venus beat younger sister Serena ( 4 ) in a match that — as intrusive as it felt to watch — surely drew more attention than any match in history between a pair of Australian Open debutantes . The fascination in their dynamic and their futures was there from the start in Melbourne Park known then as Flinders Park when it had only one stadium with a retractable roof instead of three . A picture of Venus consoling Serena after the match was on the front page of The New York Times . Though it would be tempting to label their Australian Open final on Saturday as a moment and to speculate that it might be their last meeting at this late a stage of a Grand Slam tournament it seems best to resist the temptation . The Williams sisters have taught us a lot about the limits of conventional tennis wisdom through the years . And so even if 19 years have passed and Serena is now 35 and Venus 36 it is wise to avoid fencing them in again after they have run roughshod over so many other preconceptions . “ I watched Venus today celebrating after she won the semifinal like she was a girl and it made you want to cry for joy just watching her ” said Marion Bartoli a former Wimbledon champion . “ Such a powerful image and it makes you think about all those questions she was getting : ‘ When are you retiring ? Have you thought about retiring ? How much longer ? ’ “ You must let the champions decide when the right moment comes . ” The Williamses are both great champions even if Serena is clearly the greater player with her 22 Grand Slam singles titles and her long run at No. 1 a spot she can reclaim from Angelique Kerber with a win Saturday . Serena has been the most prolific Grand Slam winner after age 30 in tennis history and she is back in rare form again after another extended break at the end of 2016 . She disconnected completely from the game and physical training initially and had to push hard to get back in shape in November and December . It worked . She has not dropped a set here despite a challenging draw nor has she even been pushed to a tiebreaker . Newly engaged to the American technology entrepreneur Alexis Ohanian who has watched her matches from the players box and seemingly refreshed Serena deserves to be the favorite to win her 23rd major singles title and break her tie with Steffi Graf for the highest total in the Open era . In this tournament
" Kenny Wells the feckless owner of a Nevada mining company is the latest entry in the Matthew McConaughey gallery of charming rogues . Swaybacked and paunchy with a thinning dome and an appetite for Winstons and Seagram ’s that would keep both brands in business if the rest of the world went cold turkey Kenny doesn ’t quite have the wolfish charisma or the mystical intensity of some of Mr. McConaughey ’s other recent characters . But like them — like Mick Haller in “ The Lincoln Lawyer ” Ron Woodroof in “ Dallas Buyers Club ” and that guy in those car commercials — he is fun to watch and hard not to root for . “ Gold ” which chronicles a few of Kenny ’s rises and falls in the 1980 s describes itself as “ inspired by actual events ” but inspiration is precisely what the film directed by Stephen Gaghan from a script by Patrick Massett and John Zinman seems to lack . Mr. McConaughey is a ball of profane entrepreneurial energy bouncing around in a vacuum . The story swings from the Nevada desert to the Indonesian rain forest to Wall Street boardrooms and the screen bristles with signifiers of capitalist activity : meetings phone calls stock tickers . But the movie isn ’t really doing any work . It ’s just looking busy . Having nearly run the family prospecting business into the ground ( so to speak ) Kenny gambles on the expertise of a Mike Acosta ( Édgar Ramírez ) a geologist with an almost mystical reputation . They strike gold in Indonesia and a gilded future opens up for Kenny and his longtime girlfriend Kaylene ( Bryce Dallas Howard ) . There are shadows and complications of course including the corruptions of wealth the treachery of rivals and Kenny ’s own impulsiveness . Broad hints are dropped that things will end badly . But enough goes wrong along the way — with the movie I mean
" Can I finally admit that my role model was a sitcom character ? Mary Richards — played to perfection by the beloved Mary Tyler Moore — was more than a role model she was a template . Even in fashion and home décor — my choices mimicked hers . Mary Tyler Moore had shown up just when everything about women ’s lives was about to change . Her show debuted in 1970 when I was 19 still in college and not imagining a career in television — or a career in anything . But two years after Mary first joyfully threw her tam hat up in the air and joined in Minneapolis I began my television career in a city also ending in ’apolis . That part is coincidental of course — but my home ? Mary lived in a studio apartment with a pullout sofa bed and not coincidentally so did I. And if my apartment was not quite so charming it wasn ’t for lack of copying . I didn ’t yet have a style of my own so whenever possible I borrowed Mary’s . A few years later when to outward appearances I was making it on my own I was on the cover of Chicago Tribune magazine holding a find — a large gold number “ 5 ” — for Channel 5 my new broadcast home . But in truth the inspiration was Mary . She had a big “ M. ” It was affixed to the wall part of the furniture just like her highboy chest of drawers . I also had one of those . In Chicago I moved up into a condo in a high rise . Mary had also moved out of her studio and into a condo where she gives herself a housewarming . Her parties — this was a running gag — were always dull . Sitting alone on the floor after her last guest has left she surveys her modern new home and says “ I HATE IT . ” I loved her for that . The ’70s were my formative years and when my career got way out ahead of me
" Mary Tyler Moore whose iconic television roles reflected the changing place of women in America died on Wednesday eliciting an outpouring of tributes on social media . Dick Van Dyke who played Ms. Moore ’s husband in the 1960 s sitcom “ The Dick Van Dyke Show ” said on Twitter that Ms. Moore had changed his life for the better . Other former and friends also shared their grief and gratitude online . They included the actors Ed Asner who played her boss at a local television station in the 1970 s sitcom “ The Mary Tyler Moore Show ” Ben Stiller and Patricia Arquette who with her in the 1996 movie “ Flirting With Disaster ” and Michael Keaton who appeared on her variety show “ Mary . ” Some remembered Ms. Moore as a role model who portrayed strong female characters onscreen . They included Oprah Winfrey who has said she grew up inspired by Ms. Moore as well as Ellen Degeneres Marlee Matlin and George Takei all of whom described Ms. Moore as a trailblazer . The comedian and actor Stephen Fry said he was rehearsing on Wednesday at the stage where “ The Mary Tyler Moore Show ” was produced adding that he and others observed a minute of silence in her honor . Female journalists felt a special affinity for Ms. Moore who starred in that show as Mary Richards a news producer at a Minneapolis television station . "
" The news can seem grim . Refugee crises extreme weather and wars plague the globe . Cellphones have exploded . America is bitterly divided . Mary Tyler Moore died . Even the doomsday clock has been reset . But we thought you could use a break whatever your politics your fears your troubles . The nation ’s zoos agree . Welcome to the Great National Cute Animal of 2017 . Over the past two days zoos and aquariums have dominated the conversation on Twitter with photo after photo of adorable animals . And the world cracked a smile . It all started according to The with a Smithsonian National Zoo announcement on Wednesday of the birth of a female gray seal on Jan. 21 a pup described as “ nursing moving and bonding well with mom . ” The baby ’s mother a gray seal named Kara set a record for being the oldest seal of her kind to give birth in a zoo . ( The Washington Post even had a Facebook Live presentation of her ultrasound in December . ) The seal ’s birth was a reminder that gray seals moved from the endangered list to being a species of least concern in 2016 by the International Union for Conservation of Nature . Their numbers rose to more than 600000 worldwide . The Smithsonian birth announcement set off a ripple online and generated a hashtag — #CuteAnimalTweetOff — which grew into a viral phenomenon as zoos posted photos of cute and fuzzy pandas otters orangutans and tiger cubs . There is even a baby turtle as well as a pun or two in the fray . “ Here we have an otterly adorable submission to #CuteAnimalTweetOff ” the Aquarium of the Pacific said on Twitter with a photo of otters . “ Leapin ’ Lemurs the #cuteanimaltweetoff is going strong ” the Maryland Zoo wrote with a photo of a lemur . The postings have gone international suggesting that maybe just maybe
" BEIRUT Lebanon — There was once a nice sea view at the Al Jazira beach club and umbrellas of palm fronds sticking from the sand are reminders of nicer days . Nowadays the place is surrounded by an garbage dump . “ It used to be a beach ” said Hassan a Syrian man who works as a caretaker at the club and insisted on being identified only by his first name because of a lawsuit concerning the landfill . “ There was sea . There were rocks . I used to fish . ” Just up the shoreline Mohammed Jradi who has been fishing the waters of the Mediterranean off Beirut for 20 years said the trash had driven even the fish away . “ All over the world they have solutions for this but not here ” he said . There is no end it seems to Lebanon ’s trash crisis a potent symbol of the dysfunctional politics that define this tiny country — just half the size of Vermont the journalist and historian David Hirst has noted . When trash piles built up across this city two years ago enveloping Beirut in a nasty stench they spawned a protest movement called “ You Stink
" It is getting closer to midnight . On Thursday the group of scientists who orchestrate the Doomsday Clock a symbolic instrument informing the public when the earth is facing imminent disaster moved its minute hand from three to two and a half minutes before the final hour . It was the closest the clock had been to midnight since 1953 the year after the United States and the Soviet Union conducted competing tests of the hydrogen bomb . Though scientists decide on the clock ’s position it is not a scientific instrument or even a physical one . The movement of its symbolic hands is decided upon by the Science and Security Board of the Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists . The organization introduced the clock on the cover of its June 1947 edition placing it at seven minutes to midnight . Since then it has moved closer to midnight and farther away depending on the board ’s conclusions . Thursday ’s announcement was made by Rachel Bronson the executive director and publisher of the bulletin . She was assisted by the theoretical physicist Lawrence Krauss the climate scientist and meteorologist David Titley and the former United States ambassador Thomas Pickering . Dr. Bronson in a interview explained why the board had included the mark in the measurement . She said that it was an signal that was meant to acknowledge “ what a dangerous moment we ’re in and how important it is for people to take note . ” “ We ’re so concerned about the rhetoric and the lack of respect for expertise that we moved it 30 seconds ” she said . “ Rather than create panic we ’re hoping that this drives action . ” In an for The New York Times
" The actor and performance artist Shia LaBeouf was arrested early Thursday morning on misdemeanor assault and harassment charges while protesting President Trump at a livestream art installation in Queens . In videos online Mr. LaBeouf — who has a history of provocative behavior and a record of arrests for minor offenses — expresses outrage evidently aimed at Mr. Trump and uses language to ask how the public can make it normal “ to be a Nazi out here . ” In one video a small gathering of fellow protesters chants “ He will not divide us ” as the bearded Mr. LaBeouf speaks . A police officer approaches and Mr. LaBeouf appears to get into a verbal altercation with him before the officer places him in handcuffs and escorts him out of the camera ’s view . Mr. LaBeouf was arrested just after 12 . 30 a. m. and charged with misdemeanor assault and with harassment according to Detective Adam Navarro of the New York City Police Department . He was issued a desk appearance ticket and instructed to come to court on April 4. He was not jailed . Detective Navarro said that the police were called after Mr. LaBeouf got into an argument with another man at the installation pulled off the man ’s scarf and in the process scratched his face . The man did not need to be hospitalized the detective said . The livestream is part of Mr. LaBeouf ’s latest art project “ He Will Not Divide Us ” a collaboration with the artists Nastja Sade Ronkko and Luke Turner . On Inauguration Day the actor placed a camera outside the Museum of the Moving Image in Astoria Queens and invited members of the public to repeat the words “ he will not divide us ” into the camera . The aim is to keep streaming images of people repeating the words throughout Mr. Trump ’s time in office . Representatives for Mr. LaBeouf did not immediately reply to requests for comment on Thursday morning . The arrest is not Mr. LaBeouf ’s first with the law : In 2014 while at a Broadway performance of the musical “ Cabaret ” he was arrested and later charged with disorderly conduct and criminal trespass . The actor first rose to prominence as a child performer on the Disney Channel television series “ Even Stevens ” and in 2008 starred in Steven Spielberg ’s “ Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull . ” More recently
" DURHAM N. C. — As North Carolina State ’s star freshman Dennis Smith Jr . down Coach K Court one last time on Monday night to put an exclamation point on the Wolfpack ’s upset of the Blue Devils many sports fans received an opportunity to take up one of their favorite pastimes : hating Duke . For Duke students and supporters the reaction to the program ’s first loss to N. C. State at Cameron Indoor Stadium since 1995 — before some of them were born — was different . “ It was a really tough one ” Richard Liu a senior who attended the game wrote in an email “ because N. C. State is a team we really should have beaten especially at home . ” It has been a rare year of disappointments for Duke . The Blue Devils began the season at No. 1 but lost the top ranking before Thanksgiving . At times they have been without their best player Grayson Allen ( suspended for tripping an opponent ) several promising freshmen from their recruiting class ( injuries ) and their Hall of Fame Coach Mike Krzyzewski ( lost to a back operation this month and still out ) . Those misfortunes of course mean it has also been a rare year of schadenfreude for many outside Duke . But perhaps there is something to be said for what Duke offers its fans . At a time when entire segments of the country have retreated into private echo chambers of elation or fear sports is not a terrible place to try to put oneself in another ’s shoes . Call it sympathy for the Blue Devils . “ Imagine how you ’d feel if you ’d gone to school there or if you played there ” said Jay Bilas an ESPN commentator who played for Duke in the 1980 s and later was an assistant coach for the Blue Devils . “ Like it ’s a blast . ” It is true that other fan bases — almost all of them actually — are more in need of a . Since 1985 — the year the N. C. A. A. tournament expanded to 64 teams and college basketball began its climb to the status of national spectacle — Duke has been the country ’s most successful program
" SAN FRANCISCO — Google and Facebook have been taking steps to curb the number of false news articles propagated across their sites . On Wednesday the Silicon Valley companies showed that they were still in the early stages of their battle to limit misinformation online . In a blog post Google said it had permanently banned nearly 200 publishers from its AdSense advertising network near the end of last year after putting into effect a policy in November to choke off websites that try to deceive users from its online ad service . On the same day Facebook introduced changes to its Trending Topics feature — a part of the social network that some have blamed for spreading false information — to better promote reliable news articles . Yet taken together the efforts showed how the fight against fake news remains a work in progress . Google ’s bans were a drop in the bucket compared with the almost two million publishers that use AdSense . Facebook ’s new measures were part of a continuing series of small experiments by the company to find out what worked best in displaying news to its users . “ We genuinely asked Google and Facebook for ‘ moonshots ’ ” said Jason Kint the chief executive of Digital Content Next an online publishing industry group . “ We appreciate the work but based on the numbers that ’s hardly even running in place . ” Google and Facebook have been in something of a situation in recent months when it comes to fake news . Both companies have been grappling with a widespread backlash over how their sites may have spread rumors on a vast scale and how little responsibility they take for any of the content that appears on their platforms . The issue came to a head after the American presidential election when commentators accused Facebook in particular of swaying voters to President Trump through misleading and untrue news articles . In response both companies have tried various measures to limit fake news . Google in November said it would ban sites that spread misinformation from AdSense as a way to impair how such sites make money . That same month Facebook updated some of its policy language which already said it would not display ads on sites that show misleading or illegal content to include fake news sites . Facebook has since introduced other changes including consulting news organizations like The Associated Press and ABC News about the accuracy of articles that users report as being false . Google ’s blog post on Wednesday was the first time the company explained the results of its moves against publishers that spread misinformation . The search giant said it reviewed 550 sites “ suspected of misrepresenting content to users including impersonating news organizations ” in November and December . It took action against 340 of those sites and kicked nearly 200 publishers off its network permanently . Google was careful not to say that these were fake news sites only sites that deceive users by misrepresenting themselves or their content . This month
" An autocratic leader has won the vote . He has charm yes and smarts of a kind but also a cruel streak . Beatings are frequent and assassination — foreign and domestic — has become commonplace . His cultural pronouncements have had a chilling effect on the arts theater in particular . Take your seat for “ Evening at the Talk House ” an comedy by the playwright and actor Wallace Shawn ( “ The Designated Mourner ” “ Aunt Dan and Lemon ” ) for the New Group that begins performances at the Signature Center on Tuesday Jan. 31 . Though written years before Donald J. Trump announced his candidacy and first produced in London in the fall of 2015 the play may strike some as oddly prescient . Set in the course of one night it eavesdrops on several people who worked together on “ Midnight in a Clearing With Moon and Stars ” a fictitious flop from a decade ago . They have gathered for a reunion at a rundown club . As they snack and sip and reminisce they reveal the brutality of the world outside and the ways that artists can abet it resist it and ignore it . The London production stoked controversy with The Independent approvingly describing a “ disturbing balefully hilarious new play ” while many other critics attacked its tone pace and politics . More than a year later in the wake of Brexit and the presidential election that controversy is likely to resonate anew . On the morning of President Trump ’s inauguration
2.0"LOS ANGELES — When “ Zoot Suit ” first opened at the Mark Taper Forum in 1978 little about the production screamed hit . Much of the cast had scant acting experience . The story itself was a Brechtian take on a relatively obscure unsolved murder in 1942 Los Angeles its climax involved a humiliating assault on a Latino man by racist United States servicemen . Just a decade earlier its writer and director Luis Valdez was creating short skits for audiences of striking farmworkers in the fields of the Central Valley in California . But audiences kept coming and coming selling out show after packed show . Fans came one week and returned with their families the next Jerry Garcia of the Grateful Dead is said to have seen the play 22 times . After running for 11 months to audiences first at the Taper and then at the Aquarius Theater in Hollywood “ Zoot Suit ” moved to New York ’s Winter Garden in 1979 where it became the first Chicano theatrical production on Broadway . Mr. Valdez then directed a version which was released in 1982 . “ We had no idea any of this would happen man ” he said . “ It was like this huge explosion . ” On Tuesday Jan. 31 a revival of “ Zoot Suit ” begins its run at the Taper kicking off the theater ’s season . A fantastical reimagining of the Sleepy Lagoon murder case in which 12 Latino youths were unjustly convicted by a biased judge “ Zoot Suit ” features racist prosecutors and lovelorn kids lively swing tunes and family squabbles .

" Enjoy the guacamole as you watch the Super Bowl on Feb. 5. Some of the ingredients might be a little more expensive next year . House Republicans and President Trump have been talking about imposing a 20 percent tax on imported goods with a White House spokesman suggesting on Thursday that such a tax might start with goods from Mexico . With the tax the price for some heavily imported items could go up . But other foods produced mainly in the United States might become slightly cheaper . While many details remain unclear here are a few indications of how the tax might work and how it would affect prices in the fruit and vegetable aisle at the supermarket . A third of all avocados eaten by Americans are grown in the United States and the rest are imported . More than nine of every 10 imported avocados come from Mexico while most of the rest come from Chile Peru and the Dominican Republic . The average retail price of an avocado varies considerably . Prices can creep up toward $ 1. 50 for the Super Bowl and Fourth of July the two biggest spikes in demand . The retail price falls toward $ 1 apiece around Christmas as demand falters but the trees grown in mild subtropical climates keep producing . Organically grown avocados have been commanding a premium of about 30 percent lately a premium that has widened over the last few years . The tax would not end up being 20 percent of a $ 1 to $ 1. 50 avocado which would be 20 to 30 cents . That is because the import tax would only be on what is known a the dutiable value — the wholesale price of the avocado assessed when it crosses the border . That does not include the cost of trucking it from the border to a grocery store in the United States the store ’s rent the store ’s bills for and other utilities or the wages for the store ’s staff . None of these costs would be subject to the tax but can help determine the retail price of the avocado . For the first 11 months of last year the average wholesale price of avocados crossing the border was 50 cents apiece . So a 20 percent tax on that wholesale price at the border would only add a dime to the cost of each avocado . It takes four or five years for a newly planted avocado tree to bear fruit . If an import tax were to be imposed on foreign avocados American farmers could not increase production quickly . That means many Americans might have to pay for taxed avocados imported from Mexico and elsewhere for a few years or potentially do without . That is right — a good guacamole needs onions
" TIJUANA Mexico — Even before President Trump decided to build the wall this Mexican border city was already overwhelmed . So many Haitian migrants traveling across the Americas began arriving here last year with hopes of crossing into the United States that churches community halls programs rehabilitation centers and private citizens have opened their doors to house feed and clothe them . In one shelter about 250 migrants — men women and children — share two toilets and one shower . Four hundred are crammed into a church . A soup kitchen sleeps hundreds in hallways a pantry and a lot out back . Now some officials and advocates worry that Mr. Trump ’s plan could spur immigration crises in towns and cities all along the border and indeed throughout Mexico . The Mexican government they say may not be able to handle it . Mr. Trump is seeking to tighten the border restrict immigration and increase deportations from the United States . In announcing his actions this week the president said they would “ help Mexico by deterring illegal immigration . ” “ Going to be very very good for Mexico
" UNITED NATIONS — The American ambassador to the United Nations Nikki R. Haley issued a stark warning on Friday to allies and rivals abroad saying in her first remarks at the headquarters of the world body that the Trump administration would hold to account those who do not back the United States . “ You ’re going to see a change in the way we do business ” Ms. Haley said . “ Our goal with the administration is to show value at the U. N. and the way we ’ll show value is to show our strength show our voice have the backs of our allies and make sure our allies have our back as well . ” “ For those who don ’t have our back ” she added “ we ’re taking names we will make points to respond to that accordingly . ” Ms. Haley offered no further details in brief remarks to reporters nor did she take questions before presenting her diplomatic credentials to the secretary general António Guterres . A former socialist politician from Portugal who took over the United Nations at the start of the year Mr. Guterres is under pressure to persuade the Trump administration to not gouge the organization and to uphold America ’s international obligations including on climate change . President Trump has dismissed the United Nations as a social club and suggested the United States could cut its funding of the organization ’s efforts . His “ America first ” pledges have raised concerns among diplomats at the United Nations about his commitment to international cooperation . The administration ’s antipathy toward the United Nations has been sharpened since a Security Council resolution last month condemning Israeli settlements . Mr. Trump and Ms. Haley have criticized the Obama administration ’s decision not to veto the resolution . And several Republican senators have supported legislation threatening to defund the United Nations unless the Security Council reverses the terms of the resolution which Council diplomats say would be politically unworkable . The United States is the United Nations ’ largest single donor providing 22 percent of its regular budget according to the terms of an international agreement that sets a country ’s contribution based on its wealth . That assessed contribution pays for operating expenses like the electricity bills at its headquarters and human rights investigations in places like Syria and South Sudan . The United States also contributes voluntarily to other United Nations programs including those that provide food and blankets to refugees fleeing war zones and that immunize children against preventable diseases . A draft executive order obtained by The New York Times proposes at least a 40 percent cut to those voluntary funds . Some of the provisions in the draft text are redundant and it is unclear how serious these proposals are or if they will ever be signed . Current and former officials said Friday that the Trump administration was delaying its plan to issue the order . The money that the United States voluntarily contributes to the United Nations is a little over 0 . 1 percent of the total federal budget . Some Republican lawmakers have sought in the past to make some of the assessed dues also voluntary but that idea has never passed muster with Congress . One area that is likely to draw scrutiny from the Trump administration
" WASHINGTON — President Trump plans to open a dialogue with Russia on Saturday that could lead to lifting American sanctions even as Britain ’s visiting prime minister and leading senators from his own party urged him not to let up the pressure on the Kremlin until it reverses its armed intervention in Ukraine . In what will be their first conversation since Mr. Trump took office he and President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia intended to talk by telephone on Saturday about areas of possible cooperation particularly in fighting terrorism in the Middle East a collaboration that would represent a significant turnabout from years of friction between the two countries . At the direction of the White House American officials in recent days have been preparing memos outlining possible common ground including the prospect of removing some or all of the sanctions imposed by former President Barack Obama according to officials briefed on the matter . Mr. Trump has suggested lifting the punitive measures in exchange for nuclear arms cuts and Russian cooperation in fighting the Islamic State . Asked about sanctions on Friday Mr. Trump played down the possibility of quick action but did not rule it out . “ As for sanctions very early to be talking about that ” Mr. Trump said Friday at a White House news conference with Prime Minister Theresa May of Britain . “ But we look to have a great relationship with all countries ideally . ” As for Mr. Putin he offered a far more distant assessment after months of praising the Russian president for his leadership . “ I don ’t know the gentleman ” Mr. Trump said . “ I hope we have a fantastic relationship . That ’s possible and it ’s also possible that we won’t . We will see what happens . ” Standing at Mr. Trump ’s side Mrs. May warned against easing sanctions unless Russia abides by a peace settlement for Ukraine negotiated in Minsk the capital of Belarus . “ We believe the sanctions should continue until we see that Minsk Agreement fully implemented and we ’ve been continuing to argue that inside the European Union ” she said . Any talk of lifting sanctions is all but certain to spark the first serious conflagration between Mr. Trump and congressional Republicans who have largely given the president a pass on myriad policy areas where they disagree . Republican lawmakers have been bracing for Mr. Trump to make this move
" Abortion opponents gathered on Friday in Washington for their annual march which has taken place every year since 1974 to protest the Supreme Court ’s Roe v. Wade decision from 1973 . ■ Vice President Mike Pence the official to ever speak in person at the march told the crowd that “ life is winning . ” ■ Kellyanne Conway counselor to President Trump also addressed the crowd . ■ The march drew thousands of activists . Mr. Pence using the refrain “ life is winning ” assured the crowd that Mr. Trump shared their opposition to abortion and would appoint a justice to the Supreme Court who held that view as well . “ We will not rest until we restore a culture of life in America ” Mr. Pence said and thousands in the crowd cheered . He also said that by many measures — the views of members of Congress and advances in science among them — “ life is winning in America . ” Standing where other Republican leaders have usually just sent video or audio recordings of their message Mr. Pence said the movement should embrace the moment . Kellyanne Conway may have sprung onto the national political scene largely unknown . But inside the movement of those opposing abortion she has been a leading figure for two decades . “ Kellyanne is one of us ” is how she was introduced at the March for Life . As a pollster and political strategist she advised numerous groups like the Susan B. Anthony List and the March for Life urging them to adopt what she often described as a more approach that avoided some of the more incendiary language of the movement in the past . Opponents of abortion gather every year on the National Mall and march to the Supreme Court . Usually their defiance is not much more than symbolism — the court is the origin of Roe v. Wade the decision in 1973 that they have sought for more than 40 years to overturn . This year they have ample reason to believe that under a government they will begin to see movement for the first time in more than a decade . In previous years no president or vice president has ever addressed the march in person . This year the Trump administration will be out in full force with the appearances of Mr. Pence and Ms. Conway . President Trump in one of his first official acts
" WASHINGTON — Sensing a political opportunity they have not had in more than a decade social conservatives are preparing for a lengthy fight over abortion rights that promises to widen the culture war fissures that Republicans have tried for years to bridge . Two fights now loom in Washington that are galvanizing the right as it solidifies control of two branches of government and moves to dominate the third : an effort in Congress to eliminate Planned Parenthood ’s federal funding and President Trump ’s forthcoming choice of a Supreme Court nominee . The choice for the court is likely to meet conservatives ’ expectations . But fulfilling even a goal of the movement like defunding Planned Parenthood will be a longer and more complicated process than it appears setting up an early and potentially defining test for the new president . Mr. Trump an eager if improbable combatant in the cause made bold promises about what he would do to restrict abortion if elected and in turn won overwhelming support from religious conservatives . Yet those promises are now tangled in intraparty politics and in some cases at least will be blocked by Senate Democrats . They include laws that would ban abortion after 20 weeks of pregnancy and permanently prohibit all federal funding including Medicaid from paying for abortions . Cutting off Planned Parenthood is part of the larger and messier debate over repealing and replacing the Affordable Care Act which Republicans so far have been unable to do . Even if the law is scrapped there is no guarantee a Planned Parenthood funding ban could easily move forward given that women ’s groups will bring intense pressure upon moderate Republicans to vote against it . On the other side of the spectrum among women ’s groups is the Susan B. Anthony List which has been lobbying to gut Planned Parenthood ’s funding and is planning to target senators who may be wavering especially in states where Mr. Trump won . “ The commitments in the House and the Senate and in the White House are so strong and the desire to get it signed is so palpable ” said Marjorie Dannenfelser
" Opponents of abortion watching the women ’s march on their televisions last Saturday stewed as they saw the Planned Parenthood logo over the stage and the actress Scarlett Johansson praising the group for the gynecological care she received as a teenager . But for these viewers there was an even bigger problem . The women ’s march had drawn an estimated people to Washington and many more to simultaneous demonstrations around the country dominating the nation ’s news coverage just six days before abortion foes were holding their annual march . Since then the organizers of that march have been telling their followers : You ’d better turn out on Friday . This year ’s march in Washington — the 44th annual March for Life — was expected to be a celebratory event at which abortion opponents could finally savor a few victories . The new president Donald J. Trump is already delivering on his promises to sign a slate of measures . He has promised to nominate a Supreme Court justice who could overturn Roe v. Wade the decision that legalized abortion 44 years ago . And a Congress dominated by Republicans is poised to cut funding for Planned Parenthood the nation ’s largest abortion provider . But a new sense of urgency anxiety and maybe a little envy has accompanied this year ’s event with organizers suddenly realizing they had a tough act to follow . “ We ’re definitely pulling out all the stops this year to try to get people to come ” said Amelia Irvine president of Georgetown Right to Life at Georgetown University in Washington . National organizers of the March for Life said that while they were hopeful of a large turnout on Friday they did not have any way to gauge how many would attend . This year ’s event will have two major draws : Vice President Mike Pence and Kellyanne Conway who managed Mr. Trump ’s campaign and is now a White House counselor are scheduled to speak . No president or vice president has ever addressed the march in person . Last year many marchers were deterred by a snowstorm that trapped some buses en route and stranded some marchers in town for days afterward . Organizers said that since so many had to cancel last year there is energy this year . One of the largest turnouts was in 2013 the 40th anniversary of Roe v. Wade and the march itself . Some abortion opponents claimed that as many as 650000 marchers showed up . But for this and every year the March for Life organization itself played it conservative
" MOUNT GILEAD Ohio — The challenge Annette Cottrell pondered was how to grade President Trump ’s stormy first full week on the job . A trade war bubbling up with Mexico . A divisive border wall . A ban on refugees from countries . Brawls with the news media and national parks . “ I ’d give him an ” Ms. Cottrell 38 said from her salon Mane Attraction on Main Street here in the seat of a conservative Ohio county of pastures and maple groves where Mr. Trump won 70 percent of the vote . “ He ’s doing what he said he was going to be doing . ” So about that week . Mr. Trump drew a torrent of criticism after pressing a series of falsehoods about voter fraud the size of the crowd at his inauguration and his attacks on the intelligence community . His executive actions reversing years of policy on immigration abortion and the environment left his critics seething and fearful and liberal opponents preparing a volley of legal challenges to blunt them . But in more than two dozen interviews this week voters who helped hand Mr. Trump the presidency — and reluctant supporters alike — were cheering from their living rooms offices and diners across America as they saw the outlines of a new conservative era in government fast taking shape even if they were still a little uneasy about the man doing the shaping . Yes they said Mr. Trump should tone down his tweets and rein in what they gently called his impulse toward “ exaggeration . ” “ Honestly he sometimes needs to shut up ” said Joshua Wade 24 of Ann Arbor Mich . a state that had not supported a Republican for president since George Bush in 1988 . “ Just do what we elected you to do . We won . Drop the inauguration stuff . It ’s fine . ” Gun rights top Mr. Wade ’s wish list for the new administration . He wants Supreme Court nominees friendly to gun owners and laws that extend rights across state lines . He said he had been encouraged that Mr. Trump took swift action on some campaign promises during his early days in office . “ There ’s no doubt : He ’s good at showmanship ” said Mr. Wade a registered Republican . “ But I think this first week is proving he ’s capable of following through on that with real action . ” But what appeals to supporters may be turning off independents . A Quinnipiac University poll released on Thursday gave Mr. Trump only a 36 percent job approval rating and found that majorities of people surveyed said he was neither honest nor levelheaded . Still
" ■ President Trump would not say whether he favors lifting sanctions imposed on Russia for its invasion of Ukraine and meddling in the election as his British counterpart rejected such a move . ■ Battle lines are forming within the Republican Party ahead of Mr. Trump ’s phone call Saturday with Russia ’s president Vladimir V. Putin . ■ The commander in chief said his defense secretary will “ override ” his views in favor of torture . President Trump said on Friday that it was “ very early ” to be talking about lifting sanctions on Russia deflecting a question about whether he would raise the issue with Russian President Vladimir V. Putin on Saturday morning even as his British counterpart flatly rejected such a move . Speaking to reporters after a meeting with Theresa May the British prime minister Mr. Trump did not say whether he supports keeping sanctions that were put in place following Russia ’s military involvement in Ukraine and its interference in the 2016 election . But he said he hoped to have a good relationship with Mr. Putin . “ If we could have a great relationship with Russia and with China and with all countries I ’m all for that ” Mr. Trump said in a brief answer to the question . Ms. May was more direct in her answer to the question about sanctions on Russia . She said the United Kingdom “ believes that the sanctions should continue . ” The answers highlight what could be one of the differences between the two leaders even as both of them insisted Friday that they plan to continue the close working relationship that has long existed between the two nations . President Trump ’s phone call scheduled on Saturday with Russia ’s president — their first conversation since Mr. Trump took office — has Republicans on edge . As one of his last acts as president Barack Obama imposed sanctions on Russia for interfering in the election to help install Mr. Trump in the Oval Office . Senator John McCain of Arizona chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee warned Mr. Trump on Friday against lifting the sanctions . What came next was a list of Russian abuses : its invasion of Ukraine its annexation of Crimea and its support of “ the murderous Assad regime as it has waged war on the Syrian people and killed more than 400000 civilians . ” Then came this : “ And in the most flagrant demonstration of Putin ’s disdain and disrespect for our nation Russia deliberately interfered in our recent election with cyberattacks and a disinformation campaign designed to weaken America and discredit Western values . ” UPDATE : Another Republican senator Rob Portman of Ohio joins in : President Trump said Friday that he will let his secretary of defense “ override ” him by banning torture even though he believes the tactics do work in getting information out of terror suspects . In a remarkable show of deference to his own subordinate Mr. Trump noted that Jim Mattis the Pentagon chief does not believe torture is effective . The president
" Donald J. Trump spent his first week in office repeating the lie that between three million and five million people had voted illegally in the November election first to members of Congress then on Twitter then in an ABC News interview then again on Twitter on Friday citing an unsubstantiated claim popular in conspiracy circles . On Wednesday Mr. Trump had announced in a pair of tweets that he would be asking for a “ major investigation ” into voter fraud “ including those registered to vote in two states . ” Since then a variety of news organizations have found that several members of Mr. Trump ’s inner circle were registered in more than one state during the election . Several still are . There is no evidence that any of them voted twice . • Steve Bannon Mr. Trump ’s strategist was registered to vote in Florida and New York the Sarasota found . • Tiffany Trump Mr. Trump ’s youngest daughter was registered in Pennsylvania and New York NBC News reported . • Sean Spicer his press secretary was registered in both Virginia and Rhode Island according to The Washington Post . • Jared Kushner his and close adviser was registered in New York and New Jersey according to The Washington Post . • Steven Mnuchin
" WASHINGTON — President Trump spoke by telephone with the acting director of the National Park Service the day after his inauguration to ask why someone from the agency had shared someone else ’s Twitter post giving an unflattering comparison of his inaugural crowd according to Mr. Trump ’s deputy press secretary . “ It was a ‘ What ’s going on ? ’ type of thing ” Sarah Huckabee Sanders the White House spokeswoman said on Thursday evening . “ Why is the National Park Service tweeting out comparison photos ? That was the bigger issue there . ” During the call Mr. Trump also asked the National Park Service ’s acting director Michael T. Reynolds if he could produce further photographic evidence of the size of his inaugural crowd according to a second person briefed on the Jan. 21 telephone call between the two men . Since becoming president Mr. Trump has repeatedly expressed outrage toward the news media for what he believes is a deliberate attempt to undermine his legitimacy by understating the size of the crowd that attended his and speech . One of those instances happened on Inauguration Day when an employee of the National Park Service used the agency ’s Twitter account to share someone else ’s post of images comparing the inaugural crowds in 2009 and 2017 . The images originally posted by a New York Times reporter showed the 2009 crowd to be much larger . Mr. Trump ’s press secretary Sean Spicer expressed outrage the next day during a forceful statement at the White House in which he lashed out at the press and claimed inaccurately that Mr. Trump had drawn “ the largest audience to ever witness an inauguration . ” Mr. Spicer later said he was talking about a combination of television and online audiences . That same morning before Mr. Spicer ’s statement Mr. Reynolds received a message from the White House that the president wanted to talk to him . They connected in the early afternoon according to one of the people who was briefed on the call and asked for anonymity because he was not authorized to discuss it . The new president asked for additional photos that could confirm his view of his crowd size . A park service spokesman
1.0"WASHINGTON — Few companies have been as intimately tied to the Democratic Party in recent years as Google . So now that Donald J. Trump is president the giant company in Silicon Valley parlance is having to pivot . The shift was evident a day after Congress began its new session this month . That evening about 70 lawmakers a majority of them Republicans were feted at the stately Smithsonian Arts and Industries Building where they clinked champagne and bourbon glasses and posed for selfies with the 600 guests assembled in their honor . The event ’s main host was not from the Republican establishment . Instead the party was primarily financed and anchored by Google . “ We ’ve partnered with Google on events before but nothing like this party ” said Alex Skatell founder of The Independent Journal Review a news with a millennial audience which also helped host the event . The event was emblematic of an by Google . Over the last eight years the company was closely associated with former President Barack Obama . Google employees overwhelmingly supported Mr. Obama ’s presidential campaigns and some later took roles in his administration .

" ( Want to get this briefing by email ? Here ’s the . ) Good evening . Here ’s the latest . _____ 1. Prime Minister Theresa May of Britain became the first foreign leader to meet President Donald Trump . Ms. May had been on edge over Mr. Trump ’s gleeful support of her country ’s withdrawal from the European Union which she opposed but has to carry out . But they vowed to work together on security and trade as they met at the White House affirming the “ special relationship ” between the two countries . Our reporters offered analysis which you can see along with the video of their press conference here . Later in the day Mr. Trump traveled to the Pentagon where he ordered “ new vetting measures to keep radical Islamic terrorists out ” of the country . He closed the nation ’s borders to refugees from around the world and temporarily suspended immigration from seven predominantly Muslim countries The American Civil Liberties Union described it as a “ euphemism for discriminating against Muslims . ” The move was met with disappointment across the Muslim world with many saying it would be interpreted as a sign that Mr. Trump sees Islam itself as the problem . _____ 2. Mr. Trump also addressed his feud with President Enrique Peña Nieto of Mexico . The two spoke by phone on Friday morning a day after Mr. Peña Nieto canceled a trip to Washington . Mr. Trump said that it was a “ very friendly call ” but repeated that he would take a tough stance on trade . Mr. Peña Nieto ’s office released a statement saying that they had agreed not to speak publicly about who will pay for the wall . Above some of the existing fencing . _____ 3. On the Mexican side of the border there ’s deep worry over the impact of Mr. Trump ’s immigration policies . Many places are already overwhelmed by migrants from Central America . In Tijuana above Haitians hoping to cross the border have crowded into churches and community centers . Immigrants ’ advocates say the Mexican government isn ’t doing enough to address the crisis and local charities don ’t have the capacity to deal with a big wave of deportees . _____ 4.

" President Trump ’s target for economic growth just got a little more distant . The government reported Friday that the economy grew by only 1. 6 percent last year shy of what experts had estimated and well below the 4 percent rate that Mr. Trump has vowed to deliver — a pledge now cited on the White House website . There are plenty of signs of life in the economy . Consumer spending is healthy and an index of consumer sentiment just hit a high . Stocks have been surging and the jobless rate is near what the Federal Reserve considers full employment . But however solid the recovery under President Barack Obama never reached exuberance . It is the second longest recovery in American history but the first in the postwar era in which growth for a full year did not hit 3 percent . Mr. Trump made that data point a focus of his campaign citing factories that closed during the recession but never reopened and workers who gave up looking for jobs and dropped out of the labor force . And economists even if they disagree with his policy prescriptions acknowledge that many areas have been left behind . While Friday ’s report will provide more support for Mr. Trump ’s argument the lackluster pace of economic growth may also complicate the new administration ’s plans . Indeed some of the headwinds in 2016 — like a widening trade deficit and cautious spending by businesses — could persist into 2017 and beyond . In particular lower exports and higher imports also hurt growth in the fourth quarter which fell to an annual rate of 1. 9 percent from 3. 5 percent in the prior quarter the Commerce Department said Friday . In 2016 personal consumption — which accounts for a majority of economic activity — slowed from 2014 and 2015 . In addition the sharp plunge in oil prices over the same period prompted steep cuts in energy production and exploration contributing to a drop in business investment . All of this underscores why analysts say that Mr. Trump ’s growth rate target of 4 percent is audacious at best and fanciful at worst especially given broader factors like an aging population and the growth rate of 2 percent or so that has prevailed since the recovery began in 2009 . “ It would defy gravity ” Diane Swonk a veteran independent economist in Chicago said . Four percent growth would require big gains in the size of the work force and productivity but neither is in the offing
" Even if President Trump ’s fails over the long run to create jobs or prevent companies from moving offshore there ’s a good chance that it will appear at first to be a success . But this is a dangerous illusion the result of companies responding strategically to the new president ’s threats . And it could lead to more bad policy if voters or policy makers draw the wrong conclusions . That ’s why it ’s important to understand precisely how these new policies are likely to shape the numbers over the next few years . Some simple economics can help . Mr. Trump has taken to Twitter to name and shame manufacturing firms planning to relocate some of their production lines overseas . His attacks on Carrier on Toyota on General Motors have made their chief executives squirm and in some cases have produced what appear to be results . Carrier for instance has promised to keep some of the jobs it had planned to send offshore in the United States . Other companies have recycled old announcements of their domestic expansion plans . At first glance pressuring a handful of companies seems unlikely to have much impact in an economy as large as that of the United States . Imagine that you are a chief executive of a company that has not been a Trump target there are so many companies in the country that the risk of yours being denounced by the president is tiny . At least that ’s what the math shows . But the psychological reality is very different . Research has shown that people often overreact to insignificant risks especially when the risks are so vivid . Just as it is almost certain that you won ’t get eaten by a shark this summer it is a near certainty that the vast majority of companies won ’t end up in Mr. Trump ’s cross hairs . Yet the fears persist and people take greater precautionary measures than the actual threat warrants . Moreover Mr. Trump is targeting the asset that corporate bosses tend to protect most jealously : their personal reputation . Which makes them edgy . So far the evidence bears this out . There are plenty of anecdotes suggesting that Mr. Trump has executives running scared . Some are hiring communications and crisis managers . Few have been willing to announce the sort of plant closings that might put them in the harsh glare of the president ’s spotlight . But this doesn ’t mean that Mr. Trump ’s tweets have saved jobs . At least not in a lasting sense . To see why not put yourself in the shoes of a C. E. O. You ’re not just deciding whether to send production offshore you also need to decide when to act . This gives you a relatively cheap way to avoid the president ’s ire : Mothball your blueprints for the new overseas factory but don ’t burn them . When the political threat passes — and eventually
" HONG KONG — You might call it a Noah ’s Ark for an era of melting polar ice sheets . An audacious plan to respond to climate change by building a city of floating islands in the South Pacific is moving forward with the government of French Polynesia agreeing to consider hosting the islands in a tropical lagoon . The project is being put forward by a California nonprofit the Seasteading Institute which has raised about $ 2. 5 million from more than 1000 interested donors . Randolph Hencken the group ’s executive director said work on the project could start in French Polynesia as early as next year pending the results of some environmental and economic feasibility studies . “ We have a vision that we ’re going to create an industry that provides floating islands to people who are threatened by rising sea levels ” Mr. Hencken said . The group ’s original founders included Peter Thiel a billionaire investor and prominent supporter of President Trump although Mr. Thiel is no longer donating to the institute Mr. Hencken said . Mr. Hencken said that the project ’s pilot islands would cost a total of $ 10 million to $ 50 million and house a few dozen people and that the initial residents would most likely be buyers from the developed world . He added that the institute was seeking to build the islands in what would be a nautical version of a special economic zone and that it would showcase innovations in solar power sustainable aquaculture and wind farms . The project ’s leaders face many hurdles such as building systems for the islands and convincing investors to buy property in such an untested environment . Joe Quirk a spokesman for the Seasteading Institute said in a 2014 video that the cost of housing on the artificial islands would initially be on par with real estate in London or New York City . But the project also appears to show how the acceleration of climate change has prompted technology entrepreneurs to devise innovative solutions to problems like rising sea levels . “ The oceans are the most ignored part of the planet so I ’m excited by the possibilities which will emerge when you get some of Silicon Valley ’s more adventurous souls focusing on the sustainable use of our coastal and marine areas ” Lelei LeLaulu a development entrepreneur from Samoa who specializes in the Pacific Islands and advises the International Finance Corporation on sustainable business said in an email from French Polynesia . But the project has critics in French Polynesia and beyond . Alexandre Le Quéré
" Some winter nights when my heart is tight I take the F train from work to stand on the sidewalk in front of the window at Lucali the famed candlelit pizzeria on Henry Street in Brooklyn and watch Mark Iacono make pizza . His movements are slow deliberative . They resemble a jungle cat grooming . The dough moves back and forth in his hands slowly growing in circumference . Iacono barely looks at it . He looks at the people in the dining room though his gaze is unfocused . His is a meditation . should be a meditation . I go home and make pizza . On other suffering evenings I walk down the echoing corridors and ramps of Grand Central Terminal and make my way to a stool in the Oyster Bar for a pan roast . I like the cherrystone version better than the oyster one and especially the rich interplay of the clam juice and the cream the way it soaks into the toast points floating in the center of the bowl . I do not make pan roasts at home . Pan roasts should be made only in the steam kettles of the Grand Central Oyster Bar . But I do make clam chowder and I float toast points on top of it and that is what John Cheever called a triumph over chaos every time . Lately I ’ve been doing both at once : pizza a balm against the pain of the world . It was probably Frank Pepe who invented the clam pizza in New Haven scattering freshly shucked littlenecks onto a round of dough then pecorino cheese
" One night six years ago on a quiet side street in Crown Heights Brooklyn I came across a photo album that had been put out with the trash . I lived around the corner and I was walking home when I saw it sitting beneath a streetlamp on Lincoln Place . It looked handmade with a wooden cover bound with a shoelace . But it had been tied up with twine like a bunch of old newspapers and left atop a pile of recycling . After hesitating a moment I picked it up and took it home . The pages were fragile and they cracked when I turned them as if the album hadn ’t been opened in a long time but the photos were perfectly preserved . They seemed to chronicle the life of a black couple at midcentury : a beautiful woman with a big smile and a man who looked serious or was maybe just and had served in World War II . As I turned the pages the scenery changed from country picnics to city streets and crowded dance halls in what appeared to be Harlem and the couple went from youth to middle age . Looking at the album I was struck by how joyful the photos were — and by the fact that as fabled as this era was I had never seen a black family ’s own account of that time . I wondered who these neighbors were and who had thrown the album out . For decades this part of Crown Heights had been mostly black . When I arrived in the neighborhood several years before
" MELBOURNE Australia — Rafael Nadal completed a slate of throwback singles finals at the Australian Open beating Grigor Dimitrov ( 5 ) ( 4 ) in a battle of 4 hours 56 minutes that started Friday evening and ended at 12:44 Saturday morning . In Sunday ’s final Nadal 30 will face his longtime rival Roger Federer 35 a nostalgic counterpoint to the women ’s championship match between Venus Williams 36 and Serena Williams 35 . Nadal and Federer have not met in a Grand Slam final since the 2011 French Open . Against Dimitrov Nadal saved three break points in a tightly fought fifth set including two at . With a backhand winner down the line he earned the crucial break in the next game to go up by and serve for the match . On Nadal ’s third match point Dimitrov ’s final backhand landed long to end a rally and Nadal fell to the ground in relief . “ Difficult to describe the emotions ” he said in his interview . “ First of all I was tired . ” That last point was emblematic of how the Nadal managed to outlast the Dimitrov time and again showing his superior physicality in the longest exchanges . The two were more evenly matched on shorter points but of the 64 points that lasted nine or more shots
" Last Saturday swarms of women ( and more than a few men ) marched in Washington and around the world following Donald Trump ’s inauguration . Some readers were concerned that The Times did an inadequate job estimating how many people showed up when it described the number as more than a million worldwide . Estimating crowd sizes has long been a fraught topic . Large gatherings of people can be difficult to estimate in precise terms — and no one will be happy with the outcome . There ’s even a group of scientists who specialize in “ crowd estimates ” as a Times piece comparing the sizes of the Washington women ’s march to Trump ’s inauguration noted . The Times used estimates compiled by the police as well as figures from mayoral public safety and homeland security offices . For greater accuracy in estimating the Washington numbers editors asked Marcel Altenburg and Keith Still crowd scientists at Manchester Metropolitan University in Britain to analyze aerial photographs and video . The Times incorporated all this material to reach its final estimate of “ more than one million . ” Since march organizers have a vested interest in a high turnout The Times only included their estimates parenthetically through a link to a website reporting a total turnout of nearly five million : “ ( March organizers offered a worldwide tally for the 673 ‘ sister ’ marches but when asked could not provide an explanation of how the tally had been calculated . ) ” An editor who helped anchor the coverage in New York said : The marches here in the States drew foreign protesters too but some were denied entry on questionable grounds . That story did not appear in The Times ’s pages and several readers noticed . The public editor ’s take : Not a huge story but from what I ’ve read on other news sites it seemed like a compelling one . Unfortunately Times readers missed out . Readers also noticed a story that is a repeated issue for The Times and one on which the public editor has written about previously . The public editor ’s take : I ’m with Schafran on this one for the reasons she states . Then there were Trump ’s views on women during the presidential campaign which came up again last weekend during the marches
" BANJUL Gambia — A week after he was inaugurated in another country Adama Barrow landed in Gambia on Thursday afternoon setting foot inside his own national borders for the first time as the new president . Throngs of supporters some holding Gambian flags lined the roads to greet Mr. Barrow who had flown in from Dakar Senegal where he had fled more than a week earlier out of security concerns after his predecessor Yahya Jammeh refused to step down . As he entered Banjul the capital Mr. Barrow dressed in all white poked out of a white Land Cruiser surrounded by military vehicles and waved to onlookers . “ Today is freedom day ” said Mariama Bah a nurse from Serekunda a town nearby who came to the airport to welcome President Barrow . “ We now have a president that we can be proud of . ” Mr. Barrow defeated the longtime president Mr. Jammeh
" NBC is looking to place its new star Megyn Kelly in the morning hours . Ms. Kelly who announced this month that she was leaving Fox News for NBC will start at the network in May and plans are beginning to take shape for her new show two people briefed on the discussions said Friday . Ms. Kelly is being considered for a time slot at 9 or 10 a. m. for a show that is expected to begin in the fall . If she moves to 10 a. m. the popular fourth hour of “ Today ” hosted by Kathie Lee Gifford and Hoda Kotb will move to 9 a. m. One thing that is known for sure : The current iteration of the third hour of “ Today ” hosted by Tamron Hall and Al Roker will be a thing of the past once Ms. Kelly ’s show begins . Ms. Kelly ’s apparent move to the morning which Variety reported earlier removes her from the tricky minefield of syndicated daytime TV . Other TV news hosts including Jane Pauley Meredith Vieira and Katie Couric have tried their hand at the format and failed . That was one of the reasons that NBC initially planned to make Ms. Kelly ’s show a straight news show because other anchors could not make it work the network saw no reason to try that strategy again . But in recent weeks NBC executives have had more of an open mind over what direction her show should take : There have been discussions about whether it should be softer in focus than what was originally discussed one person briefed on the plans said . They also have not decided whether Ms. Kelly ’s show will be branded as part of the “ Today ” show . If Ms. Kelly locked up the 9 a. m. hour it would also set up an intriguing battle royal that would pit her against another longtime morning host ABC ’s Kelly Ripa . The 9 a. m. hour for “ Today ” has long been a tricky proposition for NBC : Facing formidable competition against Ms. Ripa ’s “ Live With Kelly ” the network has tried a number of solutions
2.0"Calling your local lawmaker to express your opinion is generally seen as more effective than sending emails . But legislators have been experiencing such a high volume of calls from constituents recently that their voice mail inboxes have been filled to capacity . High on the agendas of callers : President Trump ’s cabinet nominations and the flurry of actions taken in his first week in office . J. P. Freire a spokesman for Senator Orrin Hatch Republican of Utah said on Friday that the office had doubled its voice mail capacity in the past few months when it became clear that with the new administration “ we were going to play an even larger role . ” “ Certainly we have a high call volume ” Mr. Freire said . While he declined to comment on the topics discussed with constituents he attributed some of the high volumes to Senator Hatch ’s position on several congressional committees . With votes scheduled to take place on Jan. 31 on his nominee for education secretary Betsy DeVos and his pick for attorney general Senator Jeff Sessions Republican of Alabama online campaigns promoting telephone activism are also picking up steam . Constituents and political activists are organizing to try and influence lawmakers ’ votes on the nominations and are tagging them on Twitter or Facebook if they are unable to reach staff members by telephone . On Thursday Senator Dianne Feinstein a Democrat took note of the feedback in her home state California with notes tacked onto her Twitter timeline by people trying to reach her and blaming telephone backlogs .

" A mishandled handoff between foremen may have played a role in an Amtrak crash last April in which two workers were killed when a train slammed into construction equipment that was on the tracks near Chester Pa . according to documents released on Thursday . The documents part of a continuing investigation by the National Transportation Safety Board also revealed the train ’s operator tested positive for marijuana and show a supervisor ’s distress upon hearing that the track had been cleared for use . “ Oh my gosh you ’ve got to be kidding me ” John Yaeger an Amtrak day shift foreman whose shift had just begun told a dispatcher according to a transcript of radio communications from that morning . “ Oh man . The backhoe got plowed . I can ’t believe it . ” The documents released on Thursday do not draw conclusions about what caused the crash though possible factors are cited . The crash occurred around 7:50 a. m. on April 3 when the train struck a backhoe that was being used during a multiday maintenance operation on a neighboring track according to the documents . During an interview with investigators Mr. Yaeger suggested there had been confusion in the handoff from a night foreman about whether the track had been cleared for traffic . The backhoe operator Joseph Carter Jr . 61 and his supervisor Peter Adamovich 59 died . people were taken to hospitals . The preliminary N. T. S. B. documents consist of hundreds of pages of interviews transcripts and reports and include the revelation that the train ’s operator Alexander Hunter
" In 2004 France banned vending machines from schools . In 2011 it limited servings of french fries to once a week in school cafeterias . A year later it imposed a “ soda tax . ” On Friday the government said no restaurants can offer free refills of sodas and other sugary drinks . The new regulation is the latest attempt to tackle what the government called a relentless rise in the national obesity rate . restaurants usually foreign chains are expected to be targeted under the new law . The law which takes effect immediately said it aimed to “ limit especially among the young ” the risks of obesity and diabetes . The move by France is in line with recommendations by the World Health Organization which has urged countries to impose a tax on sugary drinks to battle an increase in obesity presenting data in 2016 on the beneficial health effects of such a tax . The French are on average less overweight than other Europeans and Americans . The share of obese adults ( age 18 and older ) in France was 15 . 3 percent in 2014 just below the European Union average 15 . 9 percent according to Eurostat the statistical office of the European Union . Malta has the highest share of adult obesity of European nations 26 percent . In the United States it is 36 . 5 percent
" We all know the stereotype : silly millennials tethered to their phones unable to accomplish the simplest tasks without scrolling their Instagram feeds snapping their friends tweeting inanely . But a Nielsen report released last week shows that Americans from 18 to 34 are less obsessed with social media than some of their older peers are . Adults 35 to 49 were found to spend an average of 6 hours 58 minutes a week on social media networks compared with 6 hours 19 minutes for the younger group . More predictably adults 50 and over spent significantly less time on the networks : an average of 4 hours 9 minutes a week . Sean Casey the president of Nielsen ’s social division said the finding initially surprised him because “ the going thought is that social is vastly owned by the younger generation . ” “ It ’s kind of synonymous ” said Mr. Casey who wrote the foreword to the report . “ When you think of millennials you think of social . ” Mr. Casey 46 said that eventually the finding started to make more sense to him . “ At a time when we wanted to be connected it came out right when we were at the top of our media consumption ” he said . “ It ’s become second nature to our generation . ” The finding underscores how ubiquitous the smartphone has become . The report released on Jan. 17 found that in the United States 97 percent of people 18 to 34 and 94 percent of people 35 to 49
" My grandmother F. Helen Hunt was tough . I learned this when I was 13 the year I moved alone from London to Clinton County Ind . to live with her on her farm . I sailed in amid the wreckage of my parents ’ marriage . Maybe I should say as part of the wreckage . Upon my arrival my grandmother took one look at furious hurt young me and prescribed hugs — she was never stingy with them — and what felt to me lately prowling the streets of South Kensington and St. John ’s Wood like outrageous amounts of manual labor . These weren ’t chores : She paid me not unfairly for what I did . But it wasn ’t quite voluntary either . I hauled wood I mowed her enormous lawn with a little push mower I cleared fallen branches I raked I burned I strung and tested electric fences I dug holes I ran a rototiller I pulled weeds I knocked down derelict buildings with a crowbar and sledgehammer
" PARIS — At the end of the Jean Paul Gaultier couture show — after a stream of etched tuxedo suits 1980 s Crayola leathers and furs with hibiscus prints after the models had finally left the runway and the audience started packing up — a man with a guitar slung around his neck appeared and perched on a stool by the side of the stage . Oops . Guess it wasn ’t over after all . Then up the curtain went again to reveal … a barefoot girl standing on a swing in an angelic silken nightie with a long blond braid trailing down her back and lacy sleeves like wings . She swayed to and fro for awhile to the strumming then hopped off the swing and twirled down the catwalk before being swept off her feet by a shirtless stud in denim overalls deposited in a wheelbarrow and carted off with great fanfare into the sunset . Or at least backstage . It was a vignette sweetly meant . But couture bills itself as “ the dream . ” And are women ’s dreams these days really about being spirited into the future by a of burning man flesh ? That was mostly a rhetorical question . There ’s a reason that Isabelle Huppert just off her best actress Oscar nomination for playing a woman in “ Elle ” who instead of falling to pieces after an attack takes her vengeance into her own hands attended the Armani Privé show not in the usual elaborate cocktail gown that celebrities favor for the front row but rather a turquoise trouser suit and black mock turtleneck and looked the cooler for it . When her fellow celeb Nicole Kidman in a classic little black dress with statement jewels knelt down to pay homage you thought “ I know what you mean . ” It was on the other hand more difficult to figure out what Mr. Armani meant with the tangerine dream on the runway from orange croc jackets to orange sequined slithers to long jeweled orange vests ( there was some black too ) . To paraphrase Prime Minister Justin Trudeau of Canada
" WASHINGTON — A federal judge in Brooklyn came to the aid of scores of refugees and others who were trapped at airports across the United States on Saturday after an executive order signed by President Trump which sought to keep many foreigners from entering the country led to chaotic scenes across the globe . The judge ’s ruling blocked part of the president ’s actions preventing the government from deporting some arrivals who found themselves ensnared by the presidential order . But it stopped short of letting them into the country or issuing a broader ruling on the constitutionality of Mr. Trump ’s actions . The legal case played out on Saturday amid global turmoil as the executive order signed by the president slammed shut the borders of the United States for an Iranian scientist headed to a lab in Massachusetts a Syrian refugee family headed to a new life in Ohio and countless others across the world . The president ’s order enacted with the stroke of a pen at 4:42 p. m. Friday suspended entry of all refugees to the United States for 120 days barred Syrian refugees indefinitely and blocked entry into the United States for 90 days for citizens of seven predominantly Muslim countries : Iran Iraq Libya Somalia Sudan Syria and Yemen . The Department of Homeland Security said that the order also barred green card holders from those countries from the United States . In a briefing for reporters White House officials said that green card holders from the seven affected countries who are outside the United States would need a waiver to return . Mr. Trump — in office just a week — found himself accused of constitutional and legal overreach by two Iraqi immigrants defended by the American Civil Liberties Union . Meanwhile large crowds of protesters turned out at airports around the country to denounce Mr. Trump ’s ban on the entry of refugees and people from seven predominantly Muslim countries . Lawyers who sued the government to block the White House order said the judge ’s decision could affect an estimated 100 to 200 people who were detained upon arrival at American airports . Judge Ann M. Donnelly of Federal District Court in Brooklyn who was nominated by former President Barack Obama ruled just before 9 p. m. that implementing Mr. Trump ’s order by sending the travelers home could cause them “ irreparable harm . ” She said the government was “ enjoined and restrained from
" WASHINGTON — President Trump on Friday afternoon approved a sweeping executive order that suspended entry of all refugees to the United States for 120 days barred Syrian refugees indefinitely and blocked entry into the United States for 90 days for citizens of seven predominantly Muslim countries : Iran Iraq Libya Somalia Sudan Syria and Yemen . It also barred green card holders from those countries from the United States the Department of Homeland Security said though the administration said exemptions could be granted . Here are some major excerpts from the executive order with comments by The New York Times . The full text of the order is available here . Most of the 19 hijackers on the planes that crashed into the World Trade Center the Pentagon and a field in Shanksville Pa . were from Saudi Arabia . The rest were from the United Arab Emirates Egypt and Lebanon . None of those countries are on Mr. Trump ’s visa ban list . The nation ’s founding principles as reflected in the Declaration of Independence included dissatisfaction with what were said to be overly restrictive immigration practices . “ There is no statutory requirement that noncitizens entering the United States support the Constitution ” said Peter J. Spiro a law professor at Temple University . “ The executive order seems to suggest that even temporary visitors like tourists and students should support the U. S. Constitution which doesn ’t make a lot of sense . ” This provision is the key to the power Mr. Trump claims . It says : “ Whenever the president finds that the entry of any aliens or of any class of aliens into the United States would be detrimental to the interests of the United States he may by proclamation
" Social media shook with emotion . Headlines shouted the news . Legal scholars debated the order ’s scope . But the most immediate effect of President Trump ’s executive order barring refugees from entering the United States and halting entry from seven predominantly Muslim countries could be quantified on a human scale : refugees and other immigrants from those seven countries some on their way to the United States on Friday when Mr. Trump signed the order who were no longer able to enter the United States . Here are some of their stories . Hearing of Mr. Trump ’s plan to slam the door on Muslim immigrants this week Mr. Shareef hurried his wife and three children onto a plane in the Iraqi city of Erbil in the early hours of Saturday . They had been cleared to resettle in Nashville — a new life that Mr. Shareef considered a great opportunity . After the American invasion of Iraq in 2003 Mr. Shareef worked as a translator with American officials and he received death threats . But after the Shareefs arrived in Cairo on Saturday a official spoke to Mr. Shareef . “ He said they had just received an email from the U. S. Embassy in Baghdad ” Mr. Shareef said . “ It said we could not get on the flight . ” Speaking by phone from an airport lounge Mr. Shareef said he had sold the family home and car . His wife had given up her job . His two daughters 10 and 17 had quit school . He had spent $ 5 000 on flights . “ I thought in America there are institutions democracy ” he said . “ This looks like a decision from a dictator . I don ’t understand . ” “ Donald Trump ruined my life ” he said . Ms. Omer 39 is a green card holder has lived in the United States since 1993 and graduated from Harvard University . On Friday night Ms. Omer was detained at Kennedy International Airport as she returned from Sudan where she is a citizen after a research trip for her anthropology Ph. D. at Stanford University . Ms. Omer said customs officials were apologetic and appeared confused about what they were supposed to do with the detained travelers . “ I have to do this
" Rarely does an executive order announce a more straightforward and laudable purpose than the one President Trump signed on Friday : “ Protecting the Nation From Foreign Terrorist Entry Into the United States . ” But the president ’s directive is unlikely to significantly reduce the terrorist threat in the United States which has been a minuscule part of the overall toll of violence since 2001 . Many experts believe the order ’s unintended consequences will make the threat worse . While the order requires the Department of Homeland Security to issue a report within 180 days providing detailed statistics on foreign nationals who commit acts of violence terrorism researchers have already produced rich and revealing data . For instance since the terrorist attacks of Sept. 112001 no one has been killed in the United States in a terrorist attack by anyone who emigrated from or whose parents emigrated from Syria Iraq Iran Libya Somalia Sudan and Yemen the seven countries targeted in the order ’s visa ban according to Charles Kurzman a sociology professor at the University of North Carolina . Of Muslim Americans involved in violent extremism of any kind — for instance charged with plotting terrorism or supporting a terrorist group — only 23 percent had family backgrounds in those countries said Mr. Kurzman who just published the latest of his annual studies of Muslim Americans and terrorism . The larger point of experts is that jihadist attacks garner news attention that far outstrips their prevalence in the United States and the president ’s order appears to address not a rational calculation of risks but the visceral fears that terrorists set out to inflame . There was a random quality to the list of countries : It excluded Saudi Arabia and Egypt where the founders of Al Qaeda and many other jihadist groups have originated . Also excluded are Pakistan and Afghanistan where persistent extremism and decades of war have produced militants who have occasionally reached the United States . Notably
" BEIRUT Lebanon — Sardar Hussain refused to believe it . He had been orphaned in Afghanistan by a Taliban bomb at age 13 . After waiting in limbo for two years he said he was only days away from getting on a plane to the United States when he heard that President Trump would be barring entry to refugees . Mustafa did believe it . He teared up saying his life was over at age 28 . An Iraqi refugee in Lebanon he thought he was so close to getting to the United States that he had gone out and bought a new shirt for his trip . When she read on Facebook about the temporary ban Alwia Abdullah 43 who fled from Darfur in Sudan to Jordan with her husband and six children got a sudden stabbing pain in her gut and couldn ’t sleep . “ We left because we were discriminated against in Darfur ” she said . “ So to be discriminated against by a U. S. president by a nation we see our future in is so disheartening . How do you live with that ? ” They were among an estimated 110000 people in line to be processed for resettlement in the United States during this fiscal year . In fact they thought they had already made it through the rigorous vetting procedure and after years of waiting were on the verge of having their hopes realized . Now all are suddenly indefinitely waiting again
" President Trump ’s ban on visitors from seven predominantly Muslim nations could have a wide impact on international sports including jeopardizing a warm relationship between the United States and Iran in wrestling competitions and threatening the chances of Los Angeles hosting the 2024 Summer Olympics and of the United States securing soccer ’s 2026 World Cup . On Saturday sports officials struggled to understand the implications of Mr. Trump ’s executive order including the question of whether athletes from the targeted nations could enter the United States to compete especially in the initial period of the ban . “ We are working closely with the administration to understand the new rules and how we best navigate them as it pertains to visiting athletes ” Patrick Sandusky a spokesman for the United States Olympic Committee said in an email . “ We know they are supportive of the Olympic movement and our bid and believe we will have a good working relationship with them to ensure our success in hosting and attending events . ” At least one International Olympic Committee delegate criticized Mr. Trump ’s decision . The delegate Richard Peterkin of St. Lucia said Saturday that he considered the executive order “ very very disappointing . ” He also called the United States a “ haven ” for many athletes hoping to train outside their home countries . “ Most of our athletes from St. Lucia train in the States ” Mr. Peterkin said . “ We don ’t have an issue because we ’re not on that list of seven but if we were — there go hopes and dreams . ” On Saturday evening a federal judge blocked part of the executive order but that decision appeared unrelated to the elements of the ban that troubled sports officials . The most immediate effect may come in wrestling given that one of the nations affected by Mr. Trump ’s ban is Iran which has long had a congenial relationship with the United States in that sport . Iran said on Saturday that it would stop American citizens from entering the country in retaliation for Mr. Trump ’s order . The United States freestyle wrestling team is scheduled to participate in a World Cup competition in Iran on Feb. 8. Steve Fraser the chief for U. S. A. Wrestling and a 1984 Olympic champion said on Saturday that the president of Iran ’s wrestling federation was scheduled to meet this weekend with government officials there in an attempt to make sure the Americans would still be invited to the meet . “ There ’s some nervousness by us that the Iranian government might say ‘ We can ’t get visas to go there
" Type the word refugees into Facebook and some alarming “ news ” will appear about a refugee rape crisis a refugee disease epidemic and a risk of female genital mutilation — none of it true . For the months leading up to the presidential election and in the days since President Trump took office ultraconservative websites like Breitbart News and Infowars have published a cycle of stories with misleading claims about refugees . And it is beginning to influence public perception experts say . That shift was evident on Friday as many Americans heralded the news that the Trump administration intended to temporarily curb all refugee resettlement and increase the vetting of Syrians . “ There really is a kind of cultural battle going on ” said Cecillia Wang the deputy legal director for the American Civil Liberties Union . “ There ’s no question that kind of xenophobic or bias is infecting our political discourse about refugees . ” In speaking to pollsters about refugee resettlement Americans tend to cite concerns about the country ’s national security and economic health as their biggest worries but they have also begun to point to disease or rape experts say . “ This is something where the fear outruns the fact by a factor of 100 to 1 or even 1000 to 1 ” said William Galston a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution who has tracked American sentiment about refugee resettlement over years . Mr. Galston said the reaction to misleading coverage of refugees was reminiscent of the wave of measures introduced in state legislatures in recent years to stop the spread of Islamic law despite scant evidence that it has been promoted anywhere . And while he doubted that alarmist stories about refugees were powerful enough to change people ’s minds he said the coverage played to existing fears and pushed mere differences of opinion into hyperpartisan outrage . “ I think their opinions are being intensified because the intensification of contrary sentiments is increasing polarization ” Mr. Galston said .

" TEHRAN — As Iranians woke on Saturday to the news that none of them would be able to enter the United States for at least 90 days on the orders of President Trump panic reigned . They were turned back from flights to the United States in Tehran and in the major transfer hubs of Istanbul and Dubai . Some of those who arrived in the United States after midnight when the decree went into effect were held or deported rights groups and airline representatives said . No one not passengers airline representatives or even United States border control officials seemed to know how to interpret the executive order that went into effect at midnight on Friday . Under the new policy refugees immigrants and almost anyone from seven countries deemed to be hotbeds of terrorism are banned from the United States for 90 days pending a review of policies . Officials are just interpreting the directive by themselves said one representative for an international airline who was based in Tehran . He said the airline did not know if Iranians could fly to the United States or not . On Saturday three international airlines shuttling passengers between Iran and the United States — Emirates Lufthansa and Qatar Airways — had stopped allowing Iranians with visas or even permanent residence cards to board their planes . The Qatar Airways office in Tehran confirmed that all Iranian passengers without United States passports were stopped from flying to the United States on Friday evening and sent back to Iran . In Istanbul during a stopover on Saturday passengers reported that security officers had entered a plane after everybody boarded and ordered a young Iranian woman and her family to leave the aircraft . Holders of green cards which confer the right to live and work indefinitely in the United States received conflicting information about whether or not they would be permitted to return to the United States . But on Saturday the Department of Homeland Security clarified the executive order saying it applied even to permanent residents from the seven countries named in the ban : Iran
" PARIS — The ability of an Iranian director to attend the Academy Awards ceremony next month has been thrown into question by President Trump ’s order temporarily banning citizens of seven predominantly Muslim countries from entering the United States . The director Asghar Farhadi whose film “ The Salesman ” is nominated in the best film category was not immediately available for comment . But early Saturday Trita Parsi director of the National Iranian American Council based in Washington said in a Twitter post : “ Confirmed : Iran ’s Asghar Farhadi won ’t be let into the US to attend Oscar’s . He ’s nominated for best film . .. #MuslimBan ” In a telephone interview hours later Mr. Parsi said he had heard only second hand that Mr. Farhadi would not attend the ceremony on Feb. 26 . Mr. Parsi said his intention with the message posted on Twitter was to show that under the new immigration policy announced on Friday no Iranians would be allowed entry into the United States for 90 days . “ The clarification of the law made it very clear that he can ’t come whether a green card holder or an Iranian citizen ” Mr. Parsi said of Mr. Farhadi whose film “ A Separation ” won an Oscar for best film in 2012 . Mr. Parsi added that he had not meant to imply that the United States government had requested that Mr. Farhadi not come to the Oscars ceremony but to call attention to the ban itself . “ It is so stunning and shocking — so profoundly — that people have a hard time wrapping their heads around it ” Mr. Parsi said . It was unclear whether Mr. Farhadi would request an exemption to the visa ban or be granted one by the United States government . Earlier this week one of the stars of “ The Salesman ” Taraneh Alidoosti said in a message on Twitter that she would boycott the Oscars to protest the visa ban which she called “ racist . ” The ban was not policy at the time . “ I decided not to go even if I could because it hurts me deeply to see ordinary people of my country being rejected for what might be their legal right to have access to their children abroad or to their school classes as students ” Ms. Alidoosti told The New York Times in an interview . The government of Iran approved the “ The Salesman ” for submission to the Academy Awards it is one of five films vying for best film . The film tells the story of a couple in Tehran whose lives are upended when they move from one apartment to another while they are acting in an amateur production of “ Death of a Salesman
" As a businessman Donald J. Trump was a serial fabulist whose boasts about everything he touched routinely crumbled under the slightest scrutiny . As a candidate Mr. Trump was a magical realist who made fantastical claims punctuated by his favorite verbal tic : “ Believe me . ” Yet even jaded connoisseurs of Oval Office dissembling were astonished over the last week by the torrent of bogus claims that gushed from President Trump during his first days in office . “ We ’ve never seen anything this bizarre in our lifetimes where up is down and down is up and everything is in question and nothing is real ” said Charles Lewis the founder of the Center for Public Integrity and the author of “ 935 Lies : The Future of Truth and the Decline of America ’s Moral Integrity ” a book about presidential deception . It was not just Mr. Trump ’s debunked claim about how many people attended his inauguration or his insistence ( contradicted by his own Twitter posts ) that he had not feuded with the intelligence community or his audacious and claim that Hillary Clinton won the popular vote only because millions of people voted for her illegally . All week long news organizations chased down one Trump tall tale after another . PolitiFact a website devoted to checking the veracity of claims by public officials published 12 “ of the most misleading claims ” Mr. Trump made during his first White House interview . The Chicago Tribune found that Mr. Trump was incorrect when he claimed two people were shot and killed in Chicago the very hour President Barack Obama was there delivering his farewell address . ( There were no shootings police records showed . ) The Philadelphia Inquirer found that Mr. Trump was incorrect when he said the city ’s murder rate was “ terribly increasing . ” ( The murder rate has steadily declined over the last decade . ) The indefatigable fact checkers at The Washington Post cataloged 24 false or misleading statements made by the president during his first seven days in office . But for students of Mr. Trump ’s long business career there was much about President Trump ’s ways that was familiar : the mystifying false statements about seemingly trivial details the rewriting of history to airbrush unwanted facts the branding as liars those who point out his untruths the deft conversion of demonstrably false claims into a semantic mush of unverifiable “ beliefs . ” Mr. Trump ’s falsehoods have long been viewed as a reflexive extension of his vanity or as his method of compensating for insecurities . But throughout his business career Mr. Trump ’s most noteworthy deceptions often did double duty serving not just his ego but also important strategic goals . Mr. Trump ’s habitually inflated claims about his wealth for example
" The leads have dried up in the killing of a young woman in Queens during a jog last summer . Tips about potential suspects have gone nowhere . A reward has failed to bear fruit even as it has swelled to over $ 280 000 . And the samples of a stranger ’s DNA found on the hands throat and cellphone of the jogger Karina Vetrano 30 did not match those in national offender databases . But the authorities say that the recovered DNA could hold the key to solving the case if state officials authorize what is called familial searching which allows investigators to search criminal databases to identify likely relatives of the offender . The technique which has been used more than a dozen times in the United States over the last 10 years represents a frontier in the evolving world of forensic science . While some methods like microscopic hair testing and matching have been challenged in recent years DNA testing remains a staple of forensic investigation used to both identify suspects and exonerate the wrongfully convicted . Familial searching allows investigators to search offender databases with wider parameters to identify people who are likely to be close relatives of the person who may have committed a crime . Law enforcement officials say a hit in the database is less a piece of evidence than it is a lead and such matches have helped solve some heinous crimes in states where the practice has been authorized . But the method raises some complicated ethical issues that have trailed the expansion of DNA technology since its introduction . And as the collection of DNA grows in the private sector so do the concerns about its potential misuse particularly in the hands of government institutions . Problems at some laboratories including the New York City medical examiner ’s office have highlighted how DNA evidence is not immune from human error . A 2013 review of more than 800 rape cases processed by the medical examiner ’s office found that DNA evidence was mishandled in dozens of cases . In the case of Ms. Vetrano who the police say was sexually assaulted and strangled
" WASHINGTON — The F. B. I. had a job offer for Nick Young a veteran Washington transit officer : Become an undercover informant for the bureau and gather information at local mosques on fellow Muslims who might pose a terrorism threat . The clandestine work would be “ a lot sexier ” than his current job Mr. Young remembered an agent named Ryan telling him . And it could pay him a lot of money if the intelligence was good . Mr. Young turned him down . But it would not be the last time he would see the F. B. I. agent . Last August five years later Mr. Young was summoned to the headquarters of the transit agency Metro where Ryan and other agents were waiting for him . “ You probably don ’t recognize me do you ? ” Ryan whose beard was now thicker asked him . “ Oh I recognize you ” Mr. Young said . This time the agent handcuffed Mr. Young on a charge of supporting the Islamic State — a case built in a twist by an informant who posed as a terrorist fighter . The prosecution of Mr. Young the only law enforcement officer among more than 100 Americans who have been accused of helping the Islamic State offers a revealing look at the F. B. I. ’s shadowy efforts to identify possible Islamic extremists . President Trump has vowed to intensify the effort as part of a campaign to “ annihilate ” the militant group . Mr. Young ’s case also poses a challenge to the F. B. I. ’s expanding use of undercover operations to identify Islamic State sympathizers inside the United States who might travel overseas to help the terrorist group or commit “ lone wolf ” attacks at home . His lawyer claims that the F. B. I. entrapped him with undercover operatives popping in and out of his life for at least six years . To law enforcement officials however Mr. Young represents one of their worst fears : a longtime officer with access to sensitive facilities
" MANILA — When Lizel Torreras 35 became pregnant with her third child she mixed a tincture of bitter herbs and mahogany bark a home remedy said to induce abortion . Her husband who worked as a garbage scavenger did not make enough money to buy a regular supply of birth control pills much less raise another child . “ With just two kids we were already struggling ” she said . “ The children were going to have a hard time . We might not have been able to send them to school . ” But after three attempts Ms. Torreras a churchgoing Catholic could not bring herself to drink the potion . Like millions of other women in the Philippines who have no access to contraception Ms. Torreras had the baby . Then another one . The Philippine president Rodrigo Duterte signed an executive order this month calling for the full and immediate enforcement of a 2012 law that would give six million women like Ms. Torreras free contraception and reproductive health services . Mr. Duterte portrayed the order as an antipoverty measure with an official calling it “ and development . ” But the order was also Mr. Duterte ’s latest jab at the Roman Catholic Church which wields significant power in the Philippines and has fought for years to keep the law from taking effect . Under the law government agencies will provide modern family planning services including free contraceptives and prenatal care to all women and families . The measure also mandates that sex education be taught in schools and that companies offer reproductive health services to their employees . But the law which took more than 13 years to be passed by Congress before being signed into law in 2012
" New York City apartments are notorious for their quirks and annoyances from awkward layouts to windows that face a brick wall . When it ’s time to sell these can be major turnoffs for potential buyers . But with a little creativity many of these issues can be minimized and you don ’t have to spend a lot of money to do it . THE PROBLEM Low ceilings THE SOLUTION White paint tall window dressings and furniture Using a lighter shade of paint on the ceilings than the walls tends to draw the eye upward and make the ceiling look higher . “ Use flat not semigloss on the crown molding in the same shade as the ceiling ” recommends Pat Christodoulou who stages homes in Connecticut and New York . “ This gives you an uninterrupted perspective which results in visually raising the ceiling . ” If you don ’t have moldings she said adding a cove molding which begins on the wall and extends to the ceiling will create an elongating effect . Minimalist furnishings that sit low to the floor will help increase the impression of height . sheers will also “ give the illusion of larger windows and higher ceilings ” said Elizabeth Kee a broker at CORE in Manhattan who recently hung curtains in a $ rental in Chelsea to “ create an optical illusion that the ceilings are soaring . ” THE PROBLEM Windows that face a brick wall or let in scant light THE SOLUTION Pops of bright color strategically placed bulbs or decorative window film “ At a window that faced an alleyway or brick wall
2.0"CAPE CANAVERAL Fla . — Back in his days as a test pilot at Air Force Base in Ohio Gus Grissom had a message for his wife Betty . “ If I die have a party ” he said . Betty Grissom never did have that party . But on Friday as for the past 25 years there was a solemn observance at the memorial for her husband and two crewmates who were killed in the Apollo 1 disaster . Mr. Grissom Roger Chaffee and Ed White died in a flash fire that engulfed their capsule atop a Saturn 1B rocket during a routine training operation on Jan. 271967 . Mr. Grissom was 40 . Ms. Grissom 89 was at the memorial again on Friday wearing a denim jacket with a large Apollo 1 patch in patriotic colors . She joined old friends family members and NASA officials and veterans among them Charlie Duke who took part in the Apollo 16 moon landing . With the recent deaths of the astronauts John Glenn and Eugene A. Cernan and the sea changes in Washington the gathering felt like a memorial for an era as well as for three men . At the ceremony candles were lit for the dead astronauts by members of their families
" ROME — It began as a fight over staffing . Then came a dispute about condoms followed by papal concerns about Freemasons . Now it has become a proxy war between Pope Francis and the Vatican traditionalists who oppose him with the battleground being a Renaissance palace flanked by Jimmy Choo and Hermès storefronts on Via dei Condotti Rome ’s most exclusive street . The palace is the headquarters of the Knights of Malta the medieval Roman Catholic order . For months an ugly if quiet spat over staffing simmered behind the order ’s walls before spilling across the Tiber River to the Vatican setting off a between the two camps . Francis and his lieutenants sent angry letters . The Knights ignored them claiming sovereignty . This past week the dispute finally blew up . Fed up Francis took the extraordinary steps of demanding the resignation of the order ’s leader — a decision the Knights officially accepted Saturday — and announcing that a papal delegate would step in . Conservatives promptly denounced what they called an illegal annexation and ideological purging by a pontiff while liberal observers saw the whole episode as resulting from an act of subterfuge by the pope ’s most public critic within the Vatican hierarchy Cardinal Raymond Burke an American . A seemingly obscure squabble had erupted into an unexpected shock to the church with ideological fault lines running to the top of the Vatican . “ The Vatican is a thing built of tradition ” said John Thavis the author of “ The Vatican Diaries ” and a veteran church analyst “ and once those traditional parts start feuding with each other that is a dangerous sign . ” Francis remains one of the world ’s most popular figures but the spat with the Knights is a small indicator of how the political tensions rippling across the globe are alive in the Vatican
" MELBOURNE Australia — Serena Williams was utterly unaware that a victory on Saturday night would put her back at No. 1. Her coach Patrick Mouratoglou did all he could to keep her in the dark . But there was no hiding the other statistical stakes as Williams walked back into Rod Laver Arena headphones around her neck and in place to play her older sister Venus Williams in the Australian Open final . The tennis circuit can be an echo chamber where the same questions and themes reverberate from week to week as the locations change but the protagonists do not . So even if Serena Williams refused to entertain questions during the tournament about the possibility of winning her 23rd Grand Slam singles title and breaking her tie for the record with Steffi Graf there was no dodging that number in her own head . Now after her victory over her sister she can celebrate No. 23 instead of fret over it . “ I ’ve been chasing it for a really long time ” Williams said . “ When it got on my radar I knew I had an opportunity to get there and I ’m here . It ’s a great feeling . No better place to do it than Melbourne . ” She and her sister made their first visit to Melbourne in 1998 . They were teenagers with braces on their teeth and braids in their hair and a clear sense that they were special but no idea of just how far their talents and confidence would carry them . Much has changed in 19 years . Rod Laver Arena now has a wraparound digital screen at court level and electronic line calling . The court once green is now a deep blue . The beads and the braces are long gone but the sisters ’ power tennis remains . And though their father Richard Williams in one of the great sports predictions saw the future clearly when he said the younger fiercer Serena would turn out to be the better player
" GLEN ELDER Kan . — Doug Palen a grain farmer on Kansas ’ plains is in the business of understanding the climate . Since 2012 he has choked through the harshest drought to hit the Great Plains in a century punctuated by freakish snowstorms and suffocating gales of dust . His planting season starts earlier in the spring and pushes deeper into winter . To adapt he has embraced an environmentally conscious way of farming that guards against soil erosion and conserves precious water . He can talk for hours about carbon sequestration — the trapping of gases in plant life and in the soil — or the science of the beneficial microbes that enrich his land . In short he is a climate change realist . Just don ’t expect him to utter the words “ climate change . ” “ If politicians want to exhaust themselves debating the climate that ’s their choice ” Mr. Palen said walking through fields of freshly planted winter wheat . “ I have a farm to run . ” Here in Kansas America ’s breadbasket and conservative heartland the economic realities of agriculture make climate change a critical business issue . At the same time politics and social pressure make frank discussion complicated . This is wheat country and Donald J. Trump country and though the weather is acting up the conservative orthodoxy maintains that the science isn ’t settled . So while climate change is part of daily conversation it gets disguised as something else . “ People are all talking about it without talking about it ” said Miriam Horn

" Don Ciccone may never have achieved the fame of Frankie Valli but he was a vital member of the Four Seasons and sang on some of their biggest hits . That is his catchy voice on tastier sections of “ Who Loves You ” and “ December 1963 ( Oh What a Night ) ” both revived in the smash Broadway musical “ Jersey Boys . ” Mr. Ciccone also led The Critters in the 1960 s with hits like “ Younger Girl ” and “ Mr. Dieingly Sad ” and was a musical director and bassist for Tommy James and the Shondells in the ’90s . An obscure footnote to his extensive recording career was an unreleased batch of songs he recorded in the early 1970 s with his longtime friend Brian Gari 64 a who lives on the Upper West Side of Manhattan . Mr. Gari wrote the songs and backed Mr. Ciccone on piano on recordings they made as demos to interest record labels . Of 20 selections several were produced and released as complete songs but even on the remaining sparse tracks Mr. Ciccone ’s vocals shone . “ Don had that kind voice and we always liked the tapes ” said Mr. Gari who hung on to those old demo tapes for the next 45 years . He and Mr. Ciccone would occasionally prod each other to dust them off and release them as a “ Ciccone Sings Gari ” album . In early October Mr. Ciccone contacted Mr. Gari and said he planned to finally do just that but a week later Mr. Ciccone died of a heart attack at age 70 . “ The week before he died Don told me he wanted to put out the demos ” Mr. Gari recalled . “ He said ‘ My next project is ‘ Ciccone sings Gari . ’ ” Mr. Gari said he decided to realize Mr. Ciccone ’s “ last wish

What did I tell you ? Be who you are . Don ’t follow and try to be who someone else is . ” Ms. Parker has never been one to mince words . She believes her directness does not dilute her warmth and affection . “ Sometimes I can be really harsh ” Ms. Parker acknowledged . “ Sometimes you just have to say what you have to say .

" They treaded water for seven hours before a neighbor heard their screams . On Oct. 292012 Hurricane Sandy flooded Staten Island . As the storm surge peaked at 14 feet in the borough — among the highest levels across New York City — the water crashed through the walls of their house and DeBraan Varvaro and her younger sister Carolyn Varvaro clung to the gutter of their roof and did not let go . They waved frantically as helicopters circled overhead but no one saw or heard them over the roaring water . “ We could swim before we could walk ” the elder Ms. Varvaro said of her childhood on Staten Island ’s beaches and teenage years as a lifeguard . “ We ’re ocean people . That ’s why we survived . ” Her sister grew tired in the water and Ms. Varvaro held her up as she treaded water . In the second hour a garden statue of the Virgin Mary floated past . The younger Ms. Varvaro saw it as a sign they would survive . She kicked with renewed hope . Finally at 6 p. m. a neighbor crouched in his attic heard the women ’s screams . He helped them get the attention of more neighbors and a young man swam through the water filled with sewage dead fish and gasoline to pull them out . They were safe . But everything changed after the storm . They no longer felt safe . Over four years later the night of the hurricane and all the nights after still haunt them . The elder Ms. Varvaro

But her adoptive mother refused to let her box . She was too much of a fighter out of the ring . Ms. Acevedo who as a child would not back down from a schoolyard brawl said her irascible nature stemmed from years spent in the foster system .

" MAIDUGURI Nigeria — In a concrete house on the outskirts of this city along the airport road Abdulrahman Adam ’s body trembled as he struggled to keep down what little food he had in him . At first his grandmother Hauwa Saleh sitting by his side on the dusty floor thought Abdulrahman was teething . But everything he ate came right back up . It continued for days in September and he added a cough and started to have diarrhea . By then the signs were clear : It was not a simple illness . In this northeastern part of Nigeria ravaged by the terrorist group Boko Haram where there is not enough food to go around and no one goes to bed full Abdulrahman was withering away from malnutrition . Nearly everyone in his neighborhood crumbling under the influx of refugees fleeing the Islamist rebels is skin and bones starving and slowly dying .

" WASHINGTON — Travelers were stranded around the world protests escalated in the United States and anxiety rose within President Trump ’s party on Sunday as his order closing the nation to refugees and people from certain predominantly Muslim countries provoked a crisis just days into his administration . The White House pulled back on part of Mr. Trump ’s temporary ban on visitors from seven countries by saying that it would not apply to those with green cards granting them permanent residence in the United States . By the end of the day the Department of Homeland Security formally issued an order declaring such legal residents exempt from the order . But the recalibration did little to reassure critics at home or abroad who saw the president ’s order as a retreat from traditional American values . European leaders denounced the order and some Republican lawmakers called on Mr. Trump to back down . As of Sunday evening officials said no one was being held at American airports although lawyers said they believed that dozens were still being detained . More than any of the myriad moves Mr. Trump has made in his frenetic opening days in office the immigration order has quickly come to define his emerging presidency as one driven by a desire for decisive action even at the expense of deliberate process or coalition building . It has thrust the administration into its first constitutional conflict as multiple courts have intervened to block aspects of the order and into its broadest diplomatic incident with overseas allies objecting . The White House was left to defend what seemed to many government veterans like a slapdash process . Aides to Mr. Trump insisted they had consulted for weeks with relevant officials but the head of the customs and border service in the Obama administration who resigned on inauguration day said the incoming president ’s team never talked with him about it . White House officials blamed what they portrayed as a hyperventilating news media for the confusion and said the order had been successfully carried out . Only about 109 travelers were detained in the first 24 hours out of the 325000 who typically enter the United States in a day they said . As of Sunday evening the Department of Homeland Security said 392 green card holders had been granted waivers to enter . That did not count many visitors who remained overseas now unable to travel . Reince Priebus the White House chief of staff said Mr. Trump simply did what he had promised on the campaign trail and would not gamble with American lives . “ We ’re not willing to be wrong on this subject ” he said on “ Face the Nation ” on CBS . “ President Trump is not willing to take chances on this subject . ” The order bars entry to refugees from anywhere in the world for 120 days and from Syria indefinitely . It blocks any visitors for 90 days from seven designated countries : Iran Iraq
" WASHINGTON — As President Trump signed a sweeping executive order on Friday shutting the borders to refugees and others from seven largely Muslim countries the secretary of homeland security was on a White House conference call getting his first full briefing on the global shift in policy . Gen. John F. Kelly the secretary of homeland security had dialed in from a Coast Guard plane as he headed back to Washington from Miami . Along with other top officials he needed guidance from the White House which had not asked his department for a legal review of the order . Halfway into the briefing someone on the call looked up at a television in his office . “ The president is signing the executive order that we ’re discussing ” the official said stunned . The global confusion that has since erupted is the story of a White House that rushed to enact with little regard for basic governing a core campaign promise that Mr. Trump made to his most fervent supporters . In his first week in office Mr. Trump signed other executive actions with little or no legal review but his order barring refugees has had the most explosive implications . Passengers were barred from flights to the United States customs and border control officials got instructions at 3 a. m. Saturday and some arrived at their posts later that morning still not knowing how to carry out the president ’s orders . “ The details of it were not thought through ” said Stephen Heifetz who served in the Justice and Homeland Security Departments as well as the C. I. A. under the previous three presidents . “ It is not surprising there was mass confusion and I expect the confusion and chaos will continue for some time . ” Stephen K. Bannon the chief White House strategist oversaw the writing of the order
" Even before President Trump issued an order on Friday banning immediate entry into the United States by people from several predominantly Muslim countries immigration lawyers having heard rumors of coming action from the White House were on alert . On Wednesday lawyers from the International Refugee Assistance Project at the Urban Justice Center who were concerned that the action would affect the project ’s clients sent out an email calling for lawyers who could volunteer immediately to go to airports where refugees were scheduled to enter the United States . “ It occurred to us that there were going to be people who were traveling who would land and have their status affected while in midair ” said Betsy Fisher the group ’s policy director . And that is exactly what happened . Across the country people were detained on Sunday after being caught up in the aftermath of Mr. Trump ’s order even though a petition filed on Saturday in federal court in Brooklyn led a judge to block part of the order . Hameed Khalid Darweesh and Haider Sameer Abdulkhaleq Alshawi the plaintiffs named in the petition were originally clients of Ms. Fisher ’s organization . The email received a tremendous response Ms. Fisher said with “ well over a thousand people ” expressing interest and availability . By Saturday morning the lawyers who heeded the call were at about a dozen airports around the country . Others who heard about the effort through colleagues or the news media went to airports on their own to pitch in . By early Sunday morning Ms. Fisher said lawyers offering services and advice were at “ most international airports in the United States . ” Andre Segura a lawyer for the American Civil Liberties Union arrived at Kennedy International Airport in New York at 1:30 p. m. on Saturday . He said that the outside section of Central Diner a restaurant in Terminal 4 was “ entirely taken over by attorneys ” all working to file petitions for individual clients with the help of the clients ’ families . “ There were attorneys from numerous major law firms
" President Trump ’s executive order on immigration set off a widening political and legal crisis one week into his presidency . The order indefinitely barred Syrian refugees from entering the United States suspended all refugee admissions for 120 days and blocked citizens of seven countries refugees or otherwise from entering the United States for 90 days : Iran Iraq Libya Somalia Sudan Syria and Yemen . The immigration ban unleashed chaos on the immigration system and in airports in the United States and overseas and prompted protests and legal action . It was condemned on Monday by former President Barack Obama at least 100 American diplomats and the acting attorney general Sally Q. Yates whom Mr. Trump quickly fired on Monday night . Here is a quick guide to what we know and what we don ’t know about the order . The executive order was signed at 4:42 p. m. Eastern on Friday . The full text can be found here . It does not affect naturalized United States citizens from the seven named countries . After the order was signed students visitors and legal permanent United States residents from the seven countries — and refugees from around the world — were stopped at airports in the United States and abroad including Cairo Dubai and Istanbul . Some were blocked from entering the United States and were sent back overseas . The order quickly prompted large protests across the country . On Saturday night a federal judge in Brooklyn blocked part of Mr. Trump ’s order saying that travelers being held at airports across the United States should not be sent back to their home countries . Federal judges in three states — Massachusetts Virginia and Washington — soon issued similar rulings . On Sunday morning the Department of Homeland Security said it would comply with the rulings while it continued to enforce the president ’s executive orders . Reince Priebus
" WASHINGTON — President Trump ’s executive order on immigration is straining relations with the partner the United States needs most to reclaim the Islamic State ’s stronghold in Mosul : the Iraqis . Iraqi officials were taken aback by the directive which they learned about through the American news media because they had not been consulted first . The order blocks citizens from Iraq and six other predominantly Muslim countries from entering the United States for 90 days . That lumps Iraq together with Iran Libya Somalia Sudan Syria and Yemen nations with no strategic alliance with Washington . “ The effect is that many Iraqis will feel that the United States does not want a relationship with Iraq ” said Lukman Faily who completed a stint as Iraq ’s ambassador to Washington in June . “ We hope it is a blip . It makes it difficult for us to decipher what President Trump is up to with regard to Iraq . ” Mr. Faily has been directly affected by the order . Though he holds dual British and Iraqi citizenship he said information he had received from the American Embassy in Baghdad indicated that he would not be allowed to travel to the United States in the coming weeks to participate in a conference he said in a telephone interview from Iraq . The edict followed inflammatory comments that Mr. Trump made during a visit to the C. I. A. this month in which he said that the United States should have “ kept ” Iraq ’s oil after the invasion and might still have a chance to do so . More broadly it clashes with a memo that Mr. Trump issued on Saturday calling on the Pentagon to submit a new plan for stepping up operations against the Islamic State including by empowering “ coalition partners . ” With Iraq furnishing the ground forces for the coming assault on western Mosul and with more than 5000 American troops in the country the political support of Baghdad is essential . But current and former American officials are worried that the directive will have a corrosive effect on relations at a critical stage in the fighting . “ My brothers in Iraq ’s Army who I proudly fought with are fighting ISIS tonight ” Mark Hertling
" TEHRAN — The Iranian director Asghar Farhadi whose film “ The Salesman ” is nominated for an Academy Award for best movie said on Sunday that he would not attend the Oscars ceremony next month even if he were granted an exception to President Trump ’s visa ban for citizens from Iran and several other predominantly Muslim countries . Mr. Farhadi said he had planned to attend the Feb. 26 ceremony in Los Angeles and while there bring attention to a decision he called “ unjust . ” But the executive order signed by President Trump on Friday presented “ ifs and buts which are in no way acceptable to me even if exceptions were to be made for my trip ” he said in a statement to The New York Times . The executive order blocked entry into the United States for 90 days for citizens of Iran Iraq Libya Somalia Sudan Syria and Yemen . It also suspended entry of all refugees for 120 days and barred Syrian refugees indefinitely . Here is Mr. Farhadi ’s statement : [ See where to stream Asghar Farhadi ’s dramas at Watching The New York Times ’s film and TV recommendation site . "
" SAN FRANCISCO — On Friday morning Silicon Valley was largely ambivalent about President Trump . The software programmers marketing experts and chief executives might not have voted for him but they were hopeful about finding common ground with the new administration . By Saturday night much of that optimism had yielded to anger and determination . Mr. Trump ’s executive order late on Friday temporarily blocked all refugees while also denying entry to citizens of Iran Iraq and five other predominantly Muslim countries . The directives struck at the heart of Silicon Valley ’s cherished values its fabled history and not least its approach to customers . Two worldviews collided : the mantra of globalization that underpins the advance of technology and the nationalistic agenda of the new administration . In response a significant part of the tech community went to the barricades . Netflix ’s chief executive Reed Hastings wrote on Facebook that Mr. Trump ’s actions “ are so it pains us all ” and that “ it is time to link arms together to protect American values of freedom and opportunity . ” Brian Chesky the chief executive of Airbnb made the same point . “ We must stand with those who are affected ” he wrote on Twitter . Sergey Brin a Google founder who immigrated from the Soviet Union when he was 6 seemed to take that suggestion literally attending an impromptu protest on Saturday evening at San Francisco International Airport . When some of the demonstrators realized that the man in America was with them they asked for selfies . He obliged . “ I ’m here because I ’m a refugee ” Mr. Brin said
" Any doubts that Hollywood would take sharp aim at President Trump ’s immigration order were swiftly vanquished at the Screen Actors Guild Awards on Sunday night . Amid upsets winner after winner lashed out at the policy pleaded for acceptance of differences in a bitterly divided time and in the case of the cast of “ Stranger Things ” adopted the stance of political firebrands . “ We will get past the lies we will hunt monsters ” said David Harbour a cast member of that Netflix series which won for best television drama as the audience roared its approval . “ And when we are lost amid the hypocrisy and casual violence we will punch some people in the face when they seek to destroy the weak and the disenfranchised and the marginalized . ” The political defiance dominating the night almost overshadowed the upset wins : “ Hidden Figures ” picked up best film ensemble over “ Moonlight ” and Denzel Washington the star of “ Fences ” won best actor over Casey Affleck in “ Manchester by the Sea . ” The Screen Actors Guild Awards are heavily predictive of Oscar wins and actors make up the biggest branch of the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences which doles out those prizes next month . But in a weekend when the eyes of the world were fixed on the immigration order and widespread resistance to it Hollywood was clearly primed to sound off . The awards held at the Shrine Auditorium in Los Angeles opened with Ashton Kutcher welcoming viewers and “ everyone in airports that belong in my America . ” He added : You are a part of the fabric of who we are . And we love you and we welcome you . ” The mantle was quickly picked up by the night ’s first winner Julia ( best actress in a comedy series for “ Veep ” ) . “ My father fled religious persecution in France
" Over the past decade Christians in the United States have grown increasingly alarmed about the persecution of other Christians overseas especially in the Middle East . With each priest kidnapped in Syria each Christian family attacked in Iraq or each Coptic church bombed in Egypt the clamor for action rose . During the campaign Donald J. Trump picked up on these fears speaking frequently of Christians who were refused entry to the United States and beheaded by terrorists of the Islamic State : “ If you ’re a Christian you have no chance ” he said in Ohio in November . Now President Trump has followed through on his campaign promise to rescue Christians who are suffering . The executive order he signed on Friday gives preference to refugees who belong to a religious minority in their country and have been persecuted for their religion . The president detailed his intentions during an interview with the Christian Broadcasting Network on Friday saying his administration is giving priority to Christians because they had suffered “ more so ” than others “ so we are going to help them . ” But if Mr. Trump had hoped for Christian leaders to break out in cheers that is for the most part not what he has heard so far . A broad array of clergy members has strongly denounced Mr. Trump ’s order as discriminatory misguided and inhumane . Outrage has also come from some of the evangelical Roman Catholic and mainline Protestant leaders who represent the churches most active in trying to aid persecuted Christians . By giving preference to Christians over Muslims religious leaders have said the executive order pits one faith against another . By barring any refugees from entering the United States for nearly four months it leaves people to suffer longer in camps and prevents families from reuniting . Also
" Women in hijabs and men in jeans strolled along Fifth Avenue in Bay Ridge Brooklyn on Saturday night beneath the signs of stores and restaurants written in Arabic . It would have seemed a typical Saturday night in one of New York ’s largest neighborhoods . Except that inside those storefronts and cafes there was worry disbelief and emergency meetings prompted by President Trump ’s executive orders that temporarily banned and green card holders from seven predominantly Muslim countries . Among those countries was Yemen . At the Social Center 20 business and community leaders from across the city met to share information in Arabic and English about friends and relatives detained at airports across the United States . Everyone knew someone or was connected with someone on social media who was affected . They decried the president ’s executive orders . “ Trump grew up in Queens Yemenis were his neighbors ” Kaled Alamarie 44 said . “ That ’s his New York . ” Mr. Alamarie came to the United States when he was 10 .

" OTTAWA — Gunmen opened fire in a mosque in the city of Quebec on Sunday night killing six people and wounding eight others in what Prime Minister Justin Trudeau called a “ terrorist attack on Muslims . ” Étienne Doyon a spokesman for the Quebec police told reporters at the scene that the attack on the mosque the Islamic Cultural Center of Quebec had occurred around 8 p. m. At a news conference early Monday the police confirmed the six fatalities and said that two suspects had been arrested . The attack shook Canada a country where mass shootings are uncommon and came as the country has become known as a beacon for refugees fleeing warfare and terrorism in nations . Mr. Trudeau assailed what he called “ this terrorist attack on Muslims in a center of worship and refuge . ” “ It is to see such senseless violence ” he said in a statement early Monday . “ Diversity is our strength and religious tolerance is a value that we as Canadians hold dear . ” Christine Colombe a spokeswoman for the Quebec Provincial Police said the victims ranged in age from 35 to 70 and said that 39 people who were in the mosque were not hurt . The police had not yet identified a motive in the shootings saying the investigation was just beginning . Ms. Colombe said that one of the two suspects was arrested at the scene of the shooting while another was apprehended nearby on Île d’Orleans . The police said that some of those wounded in the shooting were seriously hurt . On Twitter Martin Coiteux the provincial minister of public safety said that “ the police systems for dealing with terrorist acts have been activated ” in the wake of the shooting . “ Ensuring the safety of the population is our priority ” he wrote . the service of the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation
" WASHINGTON — The Trump administration defended on Sunday a reorganization of the National Security Council that elevates the president ’s chief strategist Stephen K. Bannon — a political adviser with no direct national security role — to full membership and downgrades the director of national intelligence and the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff . The alteration was contained in a memorandum issued late Saturday defining the organization of the National Security Council and the Homeland Security Council the top bodies inside the White House on everything from diplomacy to counterterrorism to crisis management to nuclear and cyberpolicy . Mr. Trump ’s document drew from organizational precedents in the Obama and George W. Bush administrations . But the ascension of Mr. Bannon who until last year was the head of Breitbart News and the diminishment of the president ’s top intelligence and military advisers took Democrats and Republicans by surprise . The new memo said that the intelligence director and the Joint Chiefs chairman would attend the “ principals meetings ” — the meeting of officials — only when “ issues pertaining to their responsibilities and expertise are to be discussed . ” Sean Spicer the White House press secretary said Sunday that Mr. Bannon ’s past service as a Navy officer merited his attendance at all meetings as part of a “ streamlining ” of . He did not explain the downgrading of the general who heads the Joint Chiefs Joseph F. Dunford Jr . who rose through the Marine Corps and served in Iraq and Afghanistan . “ Well he is a former naval officer ” Mr. Spicer said of Mr. Bannon on ABC ’s “ This Week . ” “ He ’s got a tremendous understanding of the world and the geopolitical landscape that we have now . ” He added “ Having the chief strategist for the president in those meetings who has a significant military background to help make guide what the president ’s final analysis is going to be is crucial . ” When pressed on General Dunford ’s role Mr. Spicer said “ The president gets plenty of information from the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff . ” Current and former military officials said they suspected that the decision in part was prompted by the national security adviser Michael T. Flynn
" New York Times journalists are in the field in central and northern Iraq to assess the humanitarian impact of battles between the government and Islamic State fighters . TIKRIT Iraq — Udbais Musa says he punched his son and threatened to disown him when the announced last year that he was leaving home to join the Islamic State . Ultimately Mr. Musa lost both his son and his house . To punish the son Iraqi security forces evicted Mr. Musa and his family from their home on Tikrit ’s outskirts on Jan. 4. He said they had been transported by military truck to a windswept displaced persons camp with only the clothes they were wearing and a few tattered personal papers . Under a new collective punishment policy by the provincial government here at least 345 families accused of ties to the Islamic State have been evicted and confined to Al Shahama camp outside Tikrit this month according to provincial leaders . Officials said about 200 other families had been evicted and held in a school and at a separate camp called Rubaidha . Mr. Musa 60 now shares a tent with nine family members whose only crime was to have a relative who had joined the Islamic State also known as ISIS ISIL or Daesh . Several women evicted from their homes and trucked to the Shahama camp said Iraqi security forces demolished their houses with explosives after accusing their sons or husbands of joining the terrorist group . The authorities of Salahuddin Province say the punishment against the families of ISIS members is intended to force the group ’s recruits to pay a painful personal price . “ Our aim is to defy the terrorists and send a stern message to the families ” Amar Hekmat the deputy governor said inside the barricaded provincial government center . But the evictions have set off a rancorous dispute between officials in Tikrit and politicians in Baghdad . Prime Minister Haider in a letter to the provincial governor last week sharply criticized the removals and ordered provincial and Baghdad officials to resolve the issue . The tensions raised by the Salahuddin officials ’ actions cut to the heart of sectarian grievances across the whole country where tens of thousands of Sunni families have been displaced either by the Islamic State or by government offensives against the group . Even as Mr. Abadi ’s national government has tried to address reports of abuses by the security forces and their militia allies deep distrust persists in Iraq ’s Sunni communities . In an interview Mishan a member of Parliament from Salahuddin Province accused the provincial security commander of human rights violations against “ the innocent and the repressed . ” The Salahuddin operations commander Brig. Gen. Juma Enad Sadoon called critics like Mr. Jiboori “ barking dogs and mercenaries ” and said they should not interfere in security matters in Tikrit . In an interview General Sadoon did not indicate whether the removals would be halted . The evictions have evoked unwelcome comparisons to collective punishments
" RICHLAND Wash . — When Tim Snider arrived on Enewetak Atoll in the middle of the Pacific Ocean to clean up the fallout from dozens of nuclear tests on the ring of coral islands Army officers immediately ordered him to put on a respirator and a bright yellow suit designed to guard against plutonium poisoning . A military film crew snapped photos and shot movies of Mr. Snider a Air Force radiation technician in the crisp new safety gear . Then he was ordered to give all the gear back . He spent the rest of his stint on the islands wearing only cutoff shorts and a floppy sun hat . “ I never saw one of those suits again ” Mr. Snider now 58 said in an interview in his kitchen here as he thumbed a yellowing photo he still has from the 1979 shoot . “ It was just propaganda . ” Today Mr. Snider has tumors on his ribs spine and skull — which he thinks resulted from his work on the crew in the largest nuclear cleanup ever undertaken by the United States military . Roughly 4000 troops helped clean up the atoll between 1977 and 1980 . Like Mr. Snider most did not even wear shirts let alone respirators . Hundreds say they are now plagued by health problems including brittle bones cancer and birth defects in their children . Many are already dead . Others are too sick to work . The military says there is no connection between these illnesses and the cleanup . Radiation exposure during the work fell well below recommended thresholds it says and safety precautions were top notch . So the government refuses to pay for the veterans ’ medical care . Congress long ago recognized that troops were harmed by radiation on Enewetak during the original atomic tests which occurred in the 1950 s and should be cared for and compensated . Still it has failed to do the same for the men who cleaned up the toxic debris 20 years later . The disconnect continues a longstanding pattern in which the government has shrugged off responsibility for its nuclear mistakes . On one cleanup after another veterans have been denied care because shoddy or intentionally false radiation monitoring was later used as proof that there was no radiation exposure . A report by The New York Times last spring found that veterans were exposed to plutonium during the cleanup of a 1966 accident involving American hydrogen bombs in Palomares
" After learning she had a high genetic risk for breast cancer Dane’e McCree like a growing number of women decided to have her breasts removed . Her doctor assured her that reconstructive surgery would spare her nipples and leave her with breasts . It did . But while Ms. McCree ’s rebuilt chest may resemble natural breasts it is now completely numb . Her nipples lack any feeling . She cannot sense the slightest touch of her breasts perceive warmth or cold feel an itch if she has a rash or pain if she bangs into a door . And no one warned her . “ I can ’t even feel it when my kids hug me ” said Ms. McCree 31 a store manager in Grand Junction Colo . who is raising two daughters on her own . Plastic surgeons performed more than 106000 breast reconstructions in 2015 up 35 percent from 2000 . And they have embraced techniques to improve the appearance of reconstructed breasts and give them a more natural “ look and feel ” — using a woman ’s belly fat to create the new breast sparing the nipple minimizing scarring with creative incisions and offering enhancements like larger firmer lifted breasts . Doctors often promise patients that their reconstructed breasts will look even better than the breasts they had before . But they often describe the potential consequences of the surgery in ambiguous terms . Women say the fact that sensation and sexual arousal will not be restored is not made clear . The main problem is using the word “ feel ” said Dr. Clara Lee an associate professor of plastic surgery at Ohio State University who does reconstructive breast surgery . Surgeons who use a woman ’s own tissue to recreate a breast might tell the patient that it will “ feel ” like a natural breast referring to how it feels to someone else not the woman . “ We don ’t always mean what ’s important to the patient
" For Frank Vincenti there is a certain truth to those old Warner Bros. cartoons in which Wile E. Coyote scheming but hapless always takes the fall in pursuing the speedy Road Runner . “ You know that cartoon is really correct — Wile E. Coyote and the real thing are not that much different ” said Mr. Vincenti a barber by vocation but also a advocate for urban coyotes . “ Coyotes are always going to be controversial animals but they get an undeserved reputation . ” By day he gives $ 10 haircuts at his shop in Mineola N. Y. but by night he transforms into a coyote whisperer dedicated to saving coyotes in and around New York City and to challenging the perception that the animals are too dangerous to coexist with people in urban and suburban areas . After spying a coyote in the Bronx Mr. Vincenti started the Wild Dog Foundation in 1996 a nonprofit that protects coyotes . When he hears of a sighting he closes his barbershop and heads to the scene . He may spend all night working as a human scarecrow chasing the coyotes back into the underbrush . The goal is to keep them out of the public view and away from the traps set by specialists hired to euthanize them . On a recent weeknight he closed his shop and drove to an area near La Guardia Airport where a family of coyotes had settled in the woodsy patches near the bridge leading to the Rikers Island jail complex . Officials from the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey which runs the airport deemed the coyotes a danger to users of a nearby parking lot for airport employees and notified federal officials to have the coyotes removed .

" THE BLOOD OF EMMETT TILLBy Timothy B. Tyson291 pp. Simon Schuster . $ 27 . The existence of racial terror is not a singular phenomenon in our country ’s national archive . Consider 2015 a feverish June night in South Carolina when Dylann Roof feeding off racist conspiracy theories walked into Emanuel African Methodist Episcopal Church and murdered nine black parishioners . Then reach back almost 20 years before that to 1998 when James Byrd Jr . a black man was abducted by three white men and fatally dragged from the back of a pickup truck along unforgiving Texas asphalt . Then there is perhaps the most monstrous application of racial terror in our historical register : Aug. 281955 when Emmett Till was lynched . The events of that bitter morning their motivations and ramifications have found a meticulous if not their most exhaustive retelling in Timothy B. Tyson ’s “ The Blood of Emmett Till ” an account of absorbing and sometimes horrific detail . Comprehensive in scope its final 60 pages alone are a catalog of notes and sources . Tyson is a senior research scholar at Duke University and the author of “ Blood Done Sign My Name ” about the 1970 lynching of Henry Marrow in Tyson ’s hometown and he tracks Till ’s life from Argo Ill . to Chicago to his last moments in Money Miss . where — despite the hesitation of his mother
" LONDON — Without fanfare or flourish the Cherry Jones has calmly established her place as one of the major stage actresses in the United States . She has won two Tony Awards received an Emmy for her role as President Allison Taylor in “ 24 ” and earned rave reviews both on and off Broadway . But she had appeared in just one production in Britain — at last year ’s Edinburgh International Festival in John Tiffany ’s production of Tennessee Williams ’s “ The Glass Menagerie . ” As Amanda Wingfield — a desperate single mother trying to hold on to her alienated son Tom and find a viable life for her disabled and shy daughter Laura — Ms. Jones triumphed both in the production ’s original run on Broadway in 2013 and in Edinburgh . She was “ an Amanda that may someday be spoken of with the awe that surrounds Laurette Taylor ’s creation of the part nearly 70 years ago ” the critic Ben Brantley wrote in The New York Times after the Broadway opening . Now Mr. Tiffany ( who directed the hugely successful “ Harry Potter and the Cursed Child ” in London last year ) has brought that production to the Duke of York ’s Theater in London ’s West End where it opened this week . ( Michael Esper and Kate O’Flynn will play Tom and Laura with Brian J. Smith as the Gentleman Caller . ) There Ms. Jones 60 has finally made her London debut some 40 years after she created a folder and named it “ My Career on the British Stage . ” In a Skype call from Paris Tenn . where she grew up Ms. Jones talked about her early desire to act her initial resistance to the role of Amanda and her growing love for the character . Here is an edited and condensed version of the conversation : Is there any reason that you ’ve never performed in the West End ? No not really . It ’s strange because I have always wanted to work in England I didn ’t care where . My mother was a teacher of English and American literature
" Maha ’s family is divided . She immigrated to New York City in 2014 reuniting with her three sons who had arrived earlier . She expected that her husband Husham and her two other sons would soon join her from Amman Jordan finally bringing the family together after a tumultuous decade of surviving the Iraq war fleeing to Jordan and then searching for a permanent home . But on Friday the family was dealt another blow after President Trump approved a sweeping executive order on immigration that among other things blocked entry into the United States for 90 days for citizens of seven predominantly Muslim countries including Iraq where members of the family are citizens . Her husband and two sons in Jordan are for now locked out of the United States and Ms. Obaidi cannot travel away or risk being denied . “ Now our family in the U. S. can ’t even come to visit us nor can we visit them ” Mr. Qadhi said on Saturday in Amman . “ We just sit and watch like the rest of the world what is happening and our fate is being decided for us in front of our eyes . ” The family lived in Baghdad as American tanks troops and missiles tore into the Iraqi capital in 2003 . It stayed for several years despite gunfire and bomb blasts outside its house and the kidnapping of several family members . The family helped American soldiers even though other Iraqis targeted it for doing so . One of the sons in Amman Thabit said he and his father had run a snack bar on an American base in Baghdad serving candy and soft drinks to troops
" It was as though time had stood still at Latisha Hopewell ’s apartment in Lower Manhattan . A colorfully decorated Christmas tree again stood near the entrance of her mostly unadorned apartment . Freshly opened presents for her daughters Shaun and Shani Bates were stacked beneath the tree as the girls sat next to their mother on a large green sofa in their living room . Two years ago the setting was the same . Ms. Hopewell had gone back to college a year and a half earlier to set an example for her daughters and to finally secure not another job she said but a career . Though she was stretched exhaustingly thin among classes a job and parenting she talked about a renewed dedication to completing a path she had begun nearly 20 years earlier and how a degree would allow her to provide for her daughters in a way she had always wanted . Now Ms. Hopewell 37 is ebullient and full of smiles hugs and laughs . After spending the last three and a half years studying forensic psychology at the John Jay College of Criminal Justice in Midtown it was official : She was a college graduate the first in her family . “ It feels great ” she said adding that “ it will feel better once I walk down that aisle . ” She finished her degree in December but is saving the big celebration for after the graduation ceremony later this year . She has already rewarded herself in other ways though : After her last class
" It seemed like another normal day for José Rivera . His mother dropped him off at his school in San Salvador hugging him tightly as she told him she would see him at the end of the day . But there was one detail that even then at age 6 José thought was strange : She was crying . His mother Flor de Maria Rivera never returned to pick him up . A week later he learned that his mother had left for the United States to lay the groundwork for creating a better life for her family . Over the next 11 years José and his younger brother Juan were raised by their grandmother . “ I didn ’t say goodbye because it would have been too difficult ” Ms. Rivera 35 said in a recent interview . “ I might have changed my mind . ” She worked in El Salvador as an elementary schoolteacher . She loved her job but her meager salary was not enough to support the family — the boys ’ father had abandoned them soon after Juan was born — especially after the death of her father who often pitched in financially to help her . When Ms. Rivera arrived in New York City in 2005 she worked three different jobs . She never expected to stay in the United States for so long . “ The first five years were almost unbearable ” she said . “ I thought about the kids every day cried every day . ” There was a time that Ms. Rivera nearly caved in and considered buying a plane ticket home but she said her family discouraged her . As difficult as the separation was
" Laughter saved Linda Ragoo ’s face . That is what a doctor told her after she had a stroke in 2003 . It happened on a Sunday at the end of an exhausting weekend of chores errands and obligations . Ms. Ragoo felt part of her body go numb . “ I sat down by the bed and I felt my leg like it was sleeping ” Ms. Ragoo recalled . “ It ’s sleeping too long . ” She was able to call one of her sisters who rushed to Ms. Ragoo ’s Brooklyn apartment and found her on the floor unable to move the left side of her body paralyzed . While they waited for an ambulance Ms. Ragoo asked to use the bathroom . Her sister fetched a long stick presumably to prod her across the floor . Ms. Ragoo cracked up at the absurdity of the moment . “ My sister said ‘ Stop this nonsense stop this nonsense ’ ” she said . “ And I keep laughing . ” She spent the next month in a hospital . Ms. Ragoo ’s mobility is still restricted by partial paralysis . But her facial muscles built up by years of laughter are as they have always been .

1.0"WASHINGTON — President Trump fired his acting attorney general on Monday night removing her as the nation ’s top law enforcement officer after she defiantly refused to defend his executive order closing the nation ’s borders to refugees and people from predominantly Muslim countries . In an escalating crisis for his administration the president declared in a statement that Sally Q. Yates who had served as deputy attorney general under President Barack Obama had betrayed the administration by announcing that Justice Department lawyers would not defend Mr. Trump ’s order against legal challenges . The president replaced Ms. Yates with Dana J. Boente the United States attorney for the Eastern District of Virginia saying that he would serve as attorney general until Congress acts to confirm Senator Jeff Sessions of Alabama . In his first act in his new role Mr. Boente announced that he was rescinding Ms. Yates ’s order . Monday ’s events have transformed the confirmation of Mr. Sessions into a referendum on Mr. Trump ’s immigration order . Action in the Senate could come as early as Tuesday . Ms. Yates ’s order was a remarkable rebuke by a government official to a sitting president and it recalled the Saturday Night Massacre in 1973 when President Richard M. Nixon fired his attorney general and deputy attorney general for refusing to dismiss the special prosecutor in the Watergate case . Mr. Boente was sworn in at 9 p. m. according to White House officials who did not provide details about who performed the ceremony . In a statement Mr. Boente pledged to “ defend and enforce the laws of our country . ” At 9:15 p. m. Ms. Yates received a letter at the Justice Department that informed her that she was fired . Signed by John DeStefano one of Mr. Trump ’s White House aides the letter informed Ms. Yates that “ the president has removed you from the office of Deputy Attorney General of the United States . ” Two minutes later the White House officials lashed out at Ms. Yates in a statement issued by Sean Spicer the White House press secretary . “ Ms. Yates is an Obama administration appointee who is weak on borders and very weak on illegal immigration ” the statement said . The firing of Ms. Yates came at the end of a turbulent three days that began on Friday with Mr. Trump ’s signing of his executive order . The action stranded travelers around the world led to protests around the country and created alarm inside the bureaucracy . Ms. Yates like other senior government officials
" LONDON — It had all been going so well . Prime Minister Theresa May of Britain had just left Washington on Friday evening after a tense but successful first visit with President Trump for a flight to Ankara Turkey for her next awkward encounter with the increasingly autocratic Turkish president Recep Tayyip Erdogan . By the time she had landed in Turkey however Mr. Trump had signed his executive order halting entrance to the United States of all Syrian refugees and of most citizens from seven predominantly Muslim countries . Mrs. May was beginning to feel the backlash . After she termed the executive order an American issue criticism erupted even among her own members of Parliament . She was accused of appeasement by a former British diplomat . Protesters gathered outside Downing Street on Monday night and more than 1. 5 million signatures collected on an internet petition demanding that Mrs. May rescind her invitation for Mr. Trump to visit Queen Elizabeth II . A close relationship with any American president is regarded as crucial by allies and foes alike but especially by intimates like Britain Canada Japan and Mexico . Yet like moths to the flame the leaders of those nations are finding that they draw close at their peril . While Mrs. May is the latest prominent figure to suffer repercussions for her handling of Mr. Trump the leaders of those other three close allies have also felt the sting of public anger soon after what seemed to be friendly telephone calls or encounters . They then find themselves facing a situation either openly criticizing the leader of their superpower ally or pulling their punches and risking severe criticism at home . One Western leader to escape this fate so far is the German chancellor Angela Merkel who has kept a cool distance from Mr. Trump . In a telephone call on Saturday she reminded him of Washington ’s obligations under the Geneva Conventions to accept refugees fleeing war a view underlined by her official spokesman . The danger of playing nice with Mr. Trump should come as little surprise to his country ’s allies . Besides campaigning on an “ America First ” platform he has regularly argued that allies have been taking the United States for a ride
" The presidency of Donald J. Trump has been noteworthy for its speed . In his first week in office as the president ’s aides won ’t tire of reminding us Mr. Trump has already put in motion plans to do much of what he promised to do while campaigning . But it ’s not just the politician who is moving fast . It ’s the population too . In a matter of hours on Saturday thousands rushed to the nation ’s airports beckoned by tweets . The flash protests in response to Mr. Trump ’s immigration ban which continued to grow in many cities on Sunday were as organized as they were instantaneous . Dispatched online the protesters knew where to go and they knew what to do once they arrived : to command the story by making a scene . Mr. Trump feeds off media attention . Throughout the campaign the bigger a spectacle he created the larger he loomed in the public consciousness . What has been remarkable during the last two weekends is how thoroughly Mr. Trump ’s own media personage was blotted out by scenes of protesters . In a brief appearance on Saturday the president assured the nation that his immigrant ban was “ working out very nicely — you see it in the airports . ” But the pictures and videos flooding across our social streams put the lie to Mr. Trump ’s breezy pronouncements . Things at the airports weren ’t working out very nicely you could see it right there on Instagram . A similar story unfolded the weekend before . In his inaugural address Mr. Trump claimed the mantle of popular will . The next day a far larger illustration of popular will was on display at marches across the country . The people who gathered for the women ’s march hijacked the media narrative . Even for those who did not assemble on either weekend the pictures carried special power . Amplified on social media and echoing across every TV network they suggested something larger afoot something . “ Something ’s happening out there ” Ana Navarro the Republican and television pundit declared on Twitter . Something sure is . We ’re witnessing the stirrings of a national popular movement aimed at defeating the policies of Mr. Trump . It is a movement without official leaders . In fact to a noteworthy degree
" LONDON — America ’s traditional allies are on the lookout for new friends . They have heard the mantra “ America First ” from the new president divining a Trump doctrine : global cooperation last . Europeans have taken note of Mr. Trump ’s denigration of the European Union and his apparent esteem for the Russian president Vladimir V. Putin . In Asia and Latin America leaders have absorbed the deepening possibility that Mr. Trump will deliver on threats to impose punitive tariffs on Mexican and Chinese imports provoking a trade war that will damage economic growth and eliminate jobs around the world . Some allies are shifting focus to other potential partners for new sources of trade and investment relationships that could influence political diplomatic and military ties . Many are looking to China which has adroitly capitalized on a leadership vacuum in world affairs by offering itself — ironies notwithstanding — as a champion for global engagement . “ We ’ve always said that America is our best friend ” Jeroen Dijsselbloem president of the Eurogroup — comprising finance ministers from countries sharing the euro currency — said in an interview with The New York Times on the sidelines of the World Economic Forum in Davos Switzerland this month . “ If that ’s no longer the case if that ’s what we need to understand from Donald Trump then of course Europe will look for new friends . ” “ China is a very strong candidate for that ” he added . “ The Chinese involvement in Europe in terms of investment is already very high and expanding . If you push away your friends you mustn ’t be surprised if the friends start looking for new friends . ” On Wednesday Chancellor Angela Merkel of Germany spoke by telephone with Premier Li Keqiang of China . “ The two spoke in favor of free trade and a stable world trade order ” a German government spokesman later said in a written statement . The swift reassessment of trade relations — a realm in which Mr. Trump is directly threatening the order that has prevailed since the end of World War II — only amplifies the potential for a of the broader geopolitical framework . Mr. Trump has already criticized NATO as obsolete while demanding that member states pay more calling into question the alliance that has maintained security across much of Europe for more than six decades . He has provoked fears of a clash with China beyond issues of commerce by taking a congratulatory call from the president of Taiwan the island that Beijing claims as part of its territory . In shutting American borders to people from predominantly Muslim countries Mr. Trump risks inflaming tensions with Middle Eastern nations while widening a void with democratic allies over basic values . Through the fractious campaign
" WASHINGTON — By some measures President Trump has altered the perception of American foreign policy more in the past seven days than his predecessors did in the past seven decades . A nation that built its brand around the world as open to the world ’s needy and ambitious is now viewed after Mr. Trump ’s immigration executive order as closing its doors in a way it never did even after the Sept. 112001 attacks . Twenty years of efforts to rebuild a relationship with Mexico — on trade counterterrorism and drug interdiction — crashed into an avoidable blowup with the Mexican president Enrique Peña Nieto who canceled his visit here . When Prime Minister Theresa May of Britain came for what appeared to be a largely successful visit Mr. Trump ’s first by the leader of a close ally she spoke of maintaining sanctions on Russia until it met its commitments on Ukraine . Mr. Trump stayed silent . After he spoke the next day to President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia the official readout provided by the White House made no mention of Ukraine or of the operation to influence the American election that led President Barack Obama in his last days in office to issue new sanctions . Perception is different from reality . It is possible that when viewed from a distance of a few years Mr. Trump ’s pronouncements about “ extreme vetting ” and his rush to push some of America ’s most experienced career diplomats out of their jobs will look like a blitz intended to send a message to the world that he meant what he said when he talked about “ America First . ” In a statement on Sunday Mr. Trump appeared to try to soften his action arguing that “ this is not a Muslim ban as the media is falsely reporting . ” He promised to “ find ways to help all those who are suffering ” words that were missing on Friday when he announced that all refugees from Syria would be barred from entry to the United States
" Researchers academic officials and science policy makers are expressing alarm at President Trump ’s order barring entry to the United States to people from certain predominantly Muslim countries saying it could hinder research affect recruitment of top scientists and dampen the free exchange of scientific ideas . The executive order issued on Friday and clarified somewhat over the weekend by administration officials potentially affects thousands of students and researchers from Iran Iraq and five other countries . Foreigners fill the undergraduate and especially graduate ranks at many American universities and newly minted Ph. D. s from overseas flock to the United States for research and teaching positions in academic laboratories . Mary Sue Coleman the president of the Association of American Universities said that by one estimate there were about 17000 students from the seven countries at American universities . “ I ’m concerned about it hampering our ability to recruit outstanding graduate students ” said Samuel L. Stanley Jr . the president of Stony Brook University on Long Island . Dr. Stanley spent the weekend monitoring the work of immigration lawyers in a successful effort to release a Stony Brook graduate student from Iran Vahideh Rasekhi who was en route to Kennedy Airport when the order was issued and was detained after she landed . “ Immigration into the United States is tremendously important to science ” said Soumya Raychaudhuri a Harvard Medical School professor whose Iranian postdoctoral researcher Samira Asgari was barred on Saturday from boarding a flight to begin her job in his laboratory at Brigham and Women ’s Hospital in Boston . “ There are other countries competing for this talent pool and walking away from that jeopardizes our standing . ” Some foreign universities
" While President Trump ’s order banning immigration from several Muslim countries led to protests at several American airports the news was often met with satisfaction and approval in those precincts that Mr. Trump carried in the November election . And the protests themselves were viewed with irritation by some including conservatives who were otherwise critical of Mr. Trump ’s order . “ People at airports are on tight schedules and are henpecked enough as it is ” Jay Cost a senior writer for the Weekly Standard said on Twitter . ”It is uncivil and rude . ” Dan McLaughlin a securities lawyer in New York in an article for National Review wrote that the anger over the new policy was “ seriously misplaced ” and he argued that the policy was far less radical than critics had made it seem . “ His policy may be terrible public relations for the United States ” Mr. McLaughlin wrote . “ But it is fairly narrow and well within the recent tradition of immigration actions taken by the Obama administration . ” Others said that the policy which went into effect on Friday night had already been effective . Mark Kern a video game designer turned conservative political pundit who has supported video surveillance of mosques voiced his approval . He said that Mr. Trump ’s decisive action was a welcome change . “ If we sit and debate and prevaricate remember Europe did this too and now wishes it hadn’t ” he wrote in one Tweet . He added later “ Luckily we now have a POTUS who does not waver or hesitate to do what is needed . And despite hysteria to the contrary lawfully . ” The conservative pundit Tomi Lahren who supports Mr. Trump
" The annual custom of the White House Correspondents ’ Association dinner suddenly seems uncomfortable if not untenable : Journalists mingling with Trump administration aides who loathe them celebrities decrying Trump White House policies and an entertainment headliner grappling with the tone and boldness of jokes about President Trump himself . But Samantha Bee is not waiting to see how this year ’s soiree unfolds or if those involved decide to hold it at all . Instead Ms. Bee host of the topical TBS comedy show “ Full Frontal With Samantha Bee ” and her colleagues are planning a that will take place in Washington on April 29 the same night as the Correspondents ’ Association dinner . This alternative gala which is being called “ Not the White House Correspondents ’ Dinner ” and was announced on Monday will be at the Willard Hotel . Ms. Bee said that it was not an attempt to comment on or compete with that other banquet but a night to include jokes about Mr. Trump that she and comedians want to make . “ We ’re not trying to supersede it ” she said in a telephone interview . “ We just want to be there in case something happens — or doesn ’t happen — and ensure that we get to properly roast the president . ” Ms. Bee said that she and her “ Full Frontal ” producers got the idea for their event after Mr. Trump ’s election in November . “ We were talking out loud about whether we thought the White House Correspondents ’ dinner would change during a Trump presidency or if it would even exist ” she said . “ And then we thought Why don ’t we just do one just to do it in the way that we would want it done if we were hosting it ? ” The “ Not the White House Correspondents ’ Dinner ” will probably be shown on TBS in some form Ms. Bee said that those details were still being worked out as was a lineup of talent . “ We have binders full of people but we don ’t have any specifics to offer yet ” she said . Ms. Bee said that proceeds from her event would go to the Committee to Protect Journalists . The dinner held by the Correspondents ’ Association which advocates press accessibility at the White House and gives out journalism awards and scholarships has come under scrutiny in recent years . Some news organizations and observers regard it as a atmosphere for reporters to hobnob with the officials they are supposed to be covering objectively and adversarially . ( The New York Times stopped sending journalists to the dinner in 2008 . ) The event has also been the scene of two notorious incidents . At the 2006 dinner
" QUEBEC — In a world often hostile to migration Canada has stood out welcoming thousands of refugees fleeing war and seeking a haven . It has been a time for Canada proud of its national tolerance . On Sunday that was upended when a man walked into a mosque and started shooting killing six people and wounding eight . The man accused of being the gunman Alexandre Bissonnette was charged with six counts of murder on Monday . The nation quickly rallied after the attack . Prime Minister Justin Trudeau called it an act of terrorism and there was a collective outpouring of remorse and empathy . But the attack also forced Canadians to confront a growing intolerance and extremism that has taken root particularly among some people in this corner of the country . It was also a wrenching event for a country not accustomed to mass killings and even less used to the acrimonious immigration debate that has echoed from across the United States . Before Sunday many Canadians were watching the immigration ban there with fascination and for the most part disgust . “ Muslim Canadians are valued members of every community and wherever they live they deserve to feel safe they are home here ” Mr. Trudeau said at a memorial near the mosque in the Ste . Foy neighborhood in Monday evening ’s biting cold . “ We are all Canadians . Let peace unite us all . ” Yet while Canadian public figures of all stripes closed ranks quickly to reaffirm their solidarity with Muslims in Canada and tighten their embrace of multiculturalism the killings remained a tear in the fabric of a nation in transformation . “ Canada took in roughly 30000 Syrian refugees in a period — proportionate to the U. S. taking in 225000 over that time ” said David B. Harris a lawyer and a director at Insignis Strategic Research a counterterrorism consultancy . “ These are dramatic developments in the life of any nation . ” Mr. Bissonnette 27 who was also charged with five counts of attempted murder

1.0"Good morning . Here ’s what you need to know : • American divisions are rapidly widening over President Trump ’s order to close the U. S. to refugees and people from seven predominantly Muslim countries . Implemented with little regard for basic governance the measure drew support from Mr. Trump ’s supporters but criticism from protesters Silicon Valley some members of his own party State Department diplomats and even former President Obama . Mr. Trump fired the acting attorney general a holdover from the Obama administration after she instructed the Justice Department not to defend the order . World leaders have objected to the order but the leaders of U. S. allies are faced with either openly criticizing Mr. Trump or facing protests at home like the one above in Scotland . _____ • Mr. Trump ’s team was also on the defense over his startling reorganization of the National Security Council a crucial adviser on major decisions . Stephen K. Bannon the former head of the provocative website Breitbart now has a full seat on the principals committee while the roles of the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff and the director of national intelligence were downgraded . Mr. Trump sought to shift the focus to his coming Supreme Court choice . _____ • Messages of solidarity poured into Canada after a mass shooting at a Quebec mosque that left six dead . The suspect in custody was identified as a university student who according to local press reports had a history of provocative views and antisocial behavior . _____ • The top police official in the Philippines said the police would suspend participating in the nation ’s bloody drug war while he purged rogue officers like those who strangled a South Korean businessman at Police Headquarters last year . “ Ready yourselves you bad cops ” the official Ronald dela Rosa said . “ We no longer have a war on drugs
" WASHINGTON — The whirlwind first week of Donald J. Trump ’s presidency had all the bravura hallmarks of a Stephen K. Bannon production . It started with the inauguration homily to “ American carnage ” in United States cities by Mr. Bannon followed a few days later by his “ shut up ” message to the news media . The week culminated with a blizzard of executive orders mostly hatched by Mr. Bannon ’s team and the White House policy adviser Stephen Miller aimed at disorienting the “ enemy ” fulfilling campaign promises and distracting attention from Mr. Trump ’s less than flawless debut . But the defining moment for Mr. Bannon came Saturday night in the form of an executive order giving the rumpled agitator a full seat on the “ principals committee ” of the National Security Council — while downgrading the roles of the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff and the director of national intelligence who will now attend only when the council is considering issues in their direct areas of responsibilities . It is a startling elevation of a political adviser to a status alongside the secretaries of state and defense and over the president ’s top military and intelligence advisers . In theory the move put Mr. Bannon a former Navy surface warfare officer admiral ’s aide investment banker Hollywood producer and Breitbart News firebrand on the same level as his friend Michael T. Flynn the national security adviser a former Pentagon intelligence chief who was Mr. Trump ’s top adviser on national security issues before a series of missteps reduced his influence . But in terms of real influence Mr. Bannon looms above almost everyone except the president ’s Jared Kushner in the Trumpian pecking order according to interviews with two dozen Trump insiders and current and former national security officials . The move involving Mr. Bannon
2.0"WASHINGTON — In his first rocky week as President Trump ’s press secretary Sean M. Spicer was scolded by his boss pilloried as a liar hammered by journalists mocked by Stephen Colbert taunted by the ice cream brand Dippin ’ Dots and held up as the poster child for an administration that can play fast and loose with the facts . No wonder he was looking for his flak jacket . “ Is this bulletproof ? ” Mr. Spicer asked one afternoon last week peering into a closet in his sparse West Wing office as he hunted for the combat vest that by cheeky tradition is passed down from one presidential spokesman to the next . Until recently Mr. Spicer was the public voice and chief strategist of the Republican National Committee the epitome of establishment Washington . Now he is the face of an administration bent on upending the status quo and waging war on the news media surprising colleagues here with how comfortably he has embraced Mr. Trump ’s ire toward the press . The day after the inauguration he marched into the White House briefing room on Mr. Trump ’s orders and lambasted stunned reporters as “ dishonest ” while claiming against available evidence that the inauguration had been the most attended in history . ( He later said his count included viewers watching online . ) The ironic hashtag #spicerfacts was soon trending online . Days later Mr. Spicer defended Mr. Trump ’s false claims about rampant voter fraud referring to studies that do not back up the assertion and saying the president “ believes what he believes . ” On Thursday he had to walk back his suggestion that Mr. Trump would impose a major tax on Mexican imports
" MA’ALE ADUMIM West Bank — The first babies of Ma’ale Adumim a hilly city on the eastern outskirts of Jerusalem are now . A cemetery finally opened last year and 40 residents are buried there most dead of natural causes after long and peaceful lives . That is to say there is nothing temporary about this place one of the closest settlements to Jerusalem in the occupied West Bank which Israel seized from Jordan 50 years ago . “ It ’s part of Jerusalem ” said Sima Weiss 58 who has lived here 30 years raised three children and works a cleaning job just 20 minutes away by bus in the holy city proper . “ I don ’t feel like a settler . ” The world has focused more critically recently on Israel ’s settlements in occupied territory after last month ’s United Nations declaration — which the United States tacitly supported — that they are killing the dream of one state for Jews one for Palestinians . Many Israelis argue that Ma’ale Adumim — a city of 41000 with filled schools a largely secular civic pride and skittish stray cats — is a special case : Its closeness to Jerusalem has put it near the top of the list of settlements Israelis say they could swap for other land in a peace deal . Yet Ma’ale Adumim has become a flash point of the conflict between Palestinians and Israelis . politicians emboldened by a more sympathetic Trump administration want to annex it to Israel proper — the first formal annexation of a settlement . Supporters of the move argue that in the long absence of negotiations Israel cannot stand still and Ma’ale Adumim would likely be a part of Israel in any case . “ Clearly it ’s time for a quantum change
" Most people say “ I ’m sorry ” many times a day for a host of trivial affronts — accidentally bumping into someone or failing to hold open a door . These apologies are easy and usually readily accepted often with a response like “ No problem . ” But when “ I ’m sorry ” are the words needed to right truly hurtful words acts or inaction they can be the hardest ones to utter . And even when an apology is offered with the best of intentions it can be seriously undermined by the way in which it is worded . Instead of eradicating the emotional pain the affront caused a poorly worded apology can result in lasting anger and antagonism and undermine an important relationship . I admit to a lifetime of challenges when it comes to apologizing especially when I thought I was right or misunderstood or that the offended party was being overly sensitive . But I recently discovered that the need for an apology is less about me than the person who for whatever reason is offended by something I said or did or failed to do regardless of my intentions . I also learned that a sincere apology can be powerful medicine with surprising value for the giver as well as the recipient . After learning that a neighbor who had assaulted me verbally was furious about an oversight I had not known I committed I wrote a letter in hopes of defusing the hostility . Without offering any excuses I apologized for my lapse in etiquette and respect . I said I was not asking for or expecting forgiveness merely that I hoped we could have a civil if not friendly relationship going forward then delivered the letter with a jar of my homemade jam . Expecting nothing in return I was greatly relieved when my doorbell rang and the neighbor thanked me warmly for what I had said and done . My relief was palpable . I felt as if I ’d not only discarded an enemy but made a new friend which is indeed how it played out in the days that followed . About a week later I learned that according to the psychologist and author Harriet Lerner
" PARIS — France chose an idealistic traditional candidate in Sunday ’s primary to represent the Socialist and parties in the presidential election this spring . The candidate Benoît Hamon 49 who ran on the slogan that he would “ make France ’s heart beat ” bested Manuel Valls the former prime minister whose campaign has promoted more policies and who has a strong background . Mr. Hamon appeared to have won by a wide margin with incomplete returns showing him with an estimated 58 percent of the vote to Mr. Valls ’s 41 percent . “ Tonight the left holds its head up high again it is looking to the future ” Mr. Hamon said addressing his supporters . “ Our country needs the left but a modern innovative left ” he said . Mr. Hamon ’s victory was the clearest sign yet that voters on the left want a break with the policies of President François Hollande who in December announced that he would not seek . However Mr. Hamon ’s strong showing is unlikely to change widespread assessments that candidates have little chance of making it into the second round of voting in the general election . The first round of the general election is set for April 23 and the runoff for May 7. The Socialist Party is deeply divided and one measure of its lack of popular enthusiasm was the relatively low number of people voting . About two million people voted in the second round of the primary on Sunday in contrast with about 2. 9 million in the second round of the last presidential primary on the left in 2011 . However much of the conventional wisdom over how the elections will go has been thrown into question over the past week because the leading candidate
" SEOUL South Korea — President Trump assured South Korea ’s acting president on Monday of the United States ’ “ ironclad ” commitment to defend the country agreeing with Seoul to strengthen joint defense capabilities against North Korea . Mr. Trump ’s assurances came amid anxiety in South Korea over the future of the alliance with the United States . During his campaign Mr. Trump cast some doubt on the United States ’ defense and trade commitments saying that South Korea was not paying enough to help keep 28500 American troops in the country . But speaking by phone to Hwang the acting president of South Korea Mr. Trump said that the coming visit to South Korea by Defense Secretary Jim Mattis reflected the close friendship of the two countries and the importance of their alliance . Mr. Mattis is scheduled to visit South Korea on Thursday on his first official trip abroad which also includes a stop in Japan . “ President Trump reiterated our ironclad commitment to defend the R. O. K. including through the provision of extended deterrence using the full range of military capabilities ” the White House said in a statement after Mr. Trump ’s phone conversation with Mr. Hwang using the initials for South Korea ’s official name the Republic of Korea . “ The two leaders agreed to take steps to strengthen joint defense capabilities to defend against the North Korean threat . ” Mr. Hwang ’s office quoted Mr. Trump as saying that the United States would cooperate with South Korea “ 100 percent ” and that bilateral relations would be “ better than ever before . ” The two leaders shared the need for firm action to persuade North Korea to rethink its nuclear weapons development program and vowed to respond strongly if the North attempted military provocations it said . Mr. Trump ’s call with Mr. Hwang followed North Korea ’s recent warnings that it could conduct its first test of an intercontinental ballistic missile “ anytime and anywhere ” in a rebuke to Mr. Trump . Although North Korea has vowed to develop the ability to attack the United States with nuclear warheads and has tested missiles that can cover the Korean Peninsula and its vicinity it has never tested a missile that could fly over the Pacific . In a New Year ’s Day speech Kim North Korea ’s leader said his country had reached a “ final stage ” in preparing to test an intercontinental ballistic missile . The next day Mr. Trump said in a Twitter post “ It won ’t happen ! ” It remains unclear how close North Korea is to building a reliable intercontinental ballistic missile although North Korea has boasted of successfully testing crucial technology in the past year such as engines and heat shields for such a missile . Mr. Hwang the prime minister of South Korea
" WASHINGTON — One American commando was killed and three others were wounded in a fierce firefight early Sunday with Qaeda militants in central Yemen the military said on Sunday . It was the first counterterrorism operation authorized by President Trump since he took office and the commando was the first United States service member to die in the yearslong shadow war against Al Qaeda ’s Yemen affiliate . Members of the Navy ’s SEAL Team 6 carried out the surprise dawn attack and the military said that about 14 Qaeda fighters were killed during a nearly hourlong battle . A Qaeda leader — a of Anwar the cleric and top Qaeda leader in Yemen who died in a drone strike in 2011 — was believed to have been killed . After initially denying that there were any civilian casualties American officials said they were assessing reports that women and children had died in the attack . The military ’s Joint Special Operations Command had been planning the mission for months according to three senior American officials . Obama administration aides had deliberated extensively over the proposed operation weighing the value of any information that might be recovered against the risk to the Special Operations forces plunging into hostile territory . But administration officials ultimately opted to hand the decision on the mission to their successors . Mr. Trump who has vowed to increase pressure on militant groups worldwide was quickly persuaded that the rewards were worth the gamble and he authorized the mission last week military officials said . Commandos waited for a moonless evening on Saturday to exploit their advantage of fighting at night . As helicopter gunships and armed Reaper drones provided cover the commandos carried out the attack against the home of the Qaeda leader in the rugged mountainous region of Bayda Province a part of Yemen that has been a focal point of United States military operations over the past month . The main target was computer materials inside the house that could contain clues about future terrorist plots . In a statement on Sunday Mr. Trump called the raid “ successful ” and said that it had captured “ important intelligence that will assist the U. S. in preventing terrorism against its citizens and people around the world . ” He also lamented the loss of the American service member “ in our fight against the evil of radical Islamic terrorism . ” The military ’s Central Command said in an earlier statement on Sunday that “ similar operations have produced intelligence on Al Qaeda logistics recruiting and financing efforts . ” In previous raids in Iraq Syria and Somalia commandos have recovered laptop computers thumb drives and cellphones that yielded important information about militant leaders ’ locations activities and associates . A United States military aircraft helping with the operation experienced a “ hard landing ” near the site of the raid resulting in injuries to two other service members
1.0"MELBOURNE Australia — It was Roger Federer ’s unlikeliest victory in a Grand Slam tournament — quite a statement for a who has now won 18 of them . But where else should one rank this Australian Open where Federer was rightfully viewed as an underdog ? Where he arrived seeded just 17th having not played an official tournament for more than six months ? Where he faced his friendly rival Rafael Nadal in the final on sore legs ? Even Federer ’s own expectations were tempered for a change . “ I would have said a great event would be quarters ” Federer said . “ Fourth round would be nice . ” Federer would get a great deal more than that in Melbourne a city where his success has mingled with plenty of heartache and tears through the years . He wiped away a few more on Sunday as he became the oldest man to win a Grand Slam singles title in 45 years . He managed it by defeating Nadal to win the Australian Open for the fifth time . “ You don ’t know if they ever come back these moments ” said Federer who had not won a major title since Wimbledon in 2012 and who had not beaten Nadal in a Grand Slam final since Wimbledon in 2007 . Federer played here with verve and precision but had to scrap his way through three matches in the final four rounds receiving plenty of treatment between duels . Although he did not have to deal with the world ’s two leading players Andy Murray and Novak Djokovic who were upset in the first week Federer did face top 10 opponents aplenty . He defeated four of them : Tomas Berdych Kei Nishikori Stan Wawrinka and — most important — Nadal the swashbuckling Spanish who has so often thwarted Federer on big occasions but who failed to seal the deal on Sunday despite taking a lead in the fifth set . That was perhaps when Federer ’s tempered expectations helped him most . This really did feel like gravy after all the major meals he has enjoyed through the years and he stuck with the game plan he and his coaches Severin Lüthi and Ivan Ljubicic
" President Trump ’s executive order barring millions of refugees and citizens of seven countries from the United States has spurred a surge in donations to humanitarian and rights groups like the American Civil Liberties Union . The A. C. L. U. has raised more than $ 24 million in online donations since Saturday the first full day of the immigration ban said Stephen Smith a spokesman for the group . That is nearly seven times as much raised online in 2015 roughly $ 3. 5 million he added . Those donations came from at least 356306 individual donors and about of those who gave money were believed to be donors said its executive director Anthony D. Romero . “ The response from the public has been remarkable ” Mr. Romero said . “ It clearly shows that people are exercised over the proposed policies of Donald Trump . ” The A. C. L. U. also gained 150000 to 200000 new members . It had 400000 when Mr. Trump was elected in November he said . “ Clearly this executive order has hit a live nerve with the American people ” Mr. Romero said . Thousands of protesters flooded airports across the country and took to the streets as word spread that immigrants and refugees were being blocked from entering the country detained for hours by customs officials or taken off planes during the weekend after Mr. Trump signed the executive order at 4:42 p. m. on Friday . The order coming off a campaign promise suspends the entry of all refugees for 120 days
" “ M. Butterfly ” the play about a French diplomat who has a lengthy affair with a Chinese opera singer will be revived on Broadway this fall with Clive Owen starring and Julie Taymor directing .

" Seventeen years ago the Middle East was a more hopeful place . Newspapers were filled with accounts of peace negotiations . Israel was in the midst of withdrawing its troops from southern Lebanon in advance of an summit at Camp David . It was Bill Clinton ’s last year as president and expectations were rising that he would broker the comprehensive peace agreement that had eluded his predecessors . I lived in Israel my first assignment as an American diplomat . During my time there I eagerly traveled across the region taking advantage of what I realize now was a period of exceptional openness . As I neared the end of my assignment there was only one neighboring country I had not visited : Syria a dictatorship frozen in time and overflowing with archaeological sites . With the prospect of peace on the horizon I was determined to visit before it became a major tourist destination . So back in April 2000 after some nimble arranging I traveled across Syria for a week and returned to Israel satisfied with my journey . And then as I was stationed in other countries and on other continents the trip to Syria faded into background . Years would go by without my remembering it . Then in 2016 the trip flooded back as the Syrian civil war unleashed its fury on Aleppo my favorite of the cities I visited . I was seized with a fever to remember more . From my current vantage point — 42 years old the father of three young children — the trip seemed ludicrous . Did I really backpack through Syria while hiding my status as an American diplomat ? Of course then it would have seemed just as ludicrous to imagine that events in Syria would become a horrific tragedy and that borders would clang shut around the world starting with our own . As news reports about Aleppo grew worse last summer my daily life in Chicago bumped along . It was humid rainy and hot . Tomatoes grew like weeds and vines dangled from every bush trying to stretch into new territory . But my mind kept returning to that trip long ago . At first I found little evidence of it in boxes of my past : no pictures or journal entries . To help jog my memory
" It is an idea universally indulged that escaping to a spot preferably surrounded by landscapes of stunning natural beauty will spark bouts of unnatural creativity . Four years ago I tested that proposition when my wife and I left London for a tiny cottage in a remote valley in the Black Mountains of South Wales . It felt like another world . The view from the window was of sheep rather than the top deck of red London buses . Our nearest neighbor was a farm a walk across three fields . We couldn ’t hear them watching television or smell what they cooked for supper . I found that true enough with no job no friends and no television a lot of writing is possible . I never stopped to consider the cost . Social interaction was so rare that after weeks alone in my writing shed my ability to regulate conversation atrophied : A friendly question in the post office would elicit a response . I began to fear the prospect of friends visiting as a threat to my “ space . ” Then after a year or more just as the arrival of our first child transformed our isolation from a creative asset into a psychological liability Rachel our midwife came with news . “ Oh there ’s another author round here whose baby I just delivered . ” Loneliness and prideful smugness did battle : An unspoken obligation loomed . The author in question turned out to be Owen Sheers . In due course we admitted to each other the drawbacks of our rural situation . Yes with nothing but my wife and sheep for company I had written a second book much faster than the first . But I did like talking about books as well as writing them . In the now popular saying cities are where ideas go to have sex . So much of contemporary cultural production and consumption takes place in urban settings and globally

" WASHINGTON — President Trump on Tuesday nominated Judge Neil M. Gorsuch to the Supreme Court elevating a conservative in the mold of Justice Antonin Scalia to succeed the late jurist and touching off a brutal partisan showdown at the start of his presidency over the ideological bent of the nation ’s highest court . Mr. Trump announced his selection during a evening ceremony that unfolded in prime time at the White House . He described Judge Gorsuch a federal appeals court judge based in Denver as “ a man who our country really needs and needs badly to ensure the rule of law and the rule of justice . ” “ Judge Gorsuch has outstanding legal skills a brilliant mind tremendous discipline and has earned bipartisan support ” Mr. Trump said standing beside the judge and his wife Louise as White House officials and Republican lawmakers looked on . “ It is an extraordinary résumé — as good as it gets . ” But Democrats — embittered by Republican refusals for nearly a year to consider President Barack Obama ’s choice to succeed Justice Scalia and inflamed by Mr. Trump ’s aggressive moves at the start of his tenure — promised a showdown over Judge Gorsuch ’s confirmation . Joined by liberal groups that plotted for weeks to fight Mr. Trump ’s eventual nominee leading Democrats signaled they would work to turn the Supreme Court dispute into a referendum on the president and what they contend is his disregard for legal norms and the Constitution . Conservatives and business groups cheered Judge Gorsuch calling his record distinguished and his qualifications unparalleled . The announcement came at a particularly tumultuous moment in an extraordinarily chaotic beginning to Mr. Trump ’s presidency . Just a day earlier he dismissed the acting attorney general for refusing to defend his immigration order that started a furor across the United States over what critics condemned as a visa ban against Muslims . “ Now more than ever we need a Supreme Court justice who is independent eschews ideology
" President Trump announced on Tuesday that Neil M. Gorsuch a federal appeals court judge was his nominee for the Supreme Court . Following is the transcript of the announcement held in the East Room of the White House as prepared by Federal News Service . Read our coverage of the announcement . TRUMP : Thank you very much ladies and gentlemen . When Justice Scalia passed away suddenly last February I made a promise to the American people : If I were elected president I would find the very best judge in the country for the Supreme Court . I promised to select someone who respects our laws and is representative of our Constitution and who loves our Constitution and someone who will interpret them as written . TRUMP : This may be the most transparent judicial selection process in history . Months ago as a candidate I publicly presented a list of brilliant and accomplished people to the American electorate and pledged to make my choice from among that list . Millions of voters said this was the single most important issue to them when they voted for me for president . I am a man of my word . I will do as I say something that the American people have been asking for from Washington for a very very long time . Today . .. ( APPLAUSE ) Thank you . Today I am keeping another promise to the American people by nominating Judge Neil Gorsuch of the United States Supreme Court to be of the United States Supreme Court . And I would like to ask Judge Gorsuch and his wonderful wife Louise to please step forward — please Louise Judge . Here they come . Here they come . ( APPLAUSE ) So was that a surprise ? Was it ? TRUMP : I have always felt that after the defense of our nation the most important decision a president of the United States can make is the appointment of a Supreme Court justice . Depending on their age a justice can be active for 50 years and his or her decisions can last a century or more and can often be permanent . I took the task of this nomination very seriously . I have selected an individual whose qualities define — really and I mean closely define — what we ’re looking for . Judge Gorsuch has outstanding legal skills a brilliant mind tremendous discipline and has earned bipartisan support . When he was nominated to the 10th Circuit Court of Appeals he was confirmed by the Senate unanimously . Also — that ’s unanimous
" President Trump on Tuesday night named Judge Neil M. Gorsuch a federal appeals court judge in Denver to replace Justice Antonin Scalia on the United States Supreme Court . But there ’s a long way to go before the new nominee is confirmed . Judge Gorsuch will immediately face a public and private gantlet of scrutiny and could end up at the center of fevered political maneuvering . Just 51 votes are needed to confirm him but one big question looms : Will the Senate Democrats filibuster the nomination ? That would require 60 votes to overcome . Expect the task to drag on for months : Elena Kagan was confirmed 87 days after she was nominated in 2010 Sonia Sotomayor ’s confirmation in 2009 took 66 days and Samuel Alito Jr . was confirmed 82 days after his nod in 2006 . Events would have to unfold very smoothly for the nominee to be confirmed by April 26 the date of the last scheduled arguments in the current court term which typically ends in late June . The next term begins in October . Here ’s what to expect in the nomination process . The nominee must fill out an elaborate questionnaire which the Senate will examine . He will be asked to list every client he has ever represented sources of income speaking fees travel destinations media interviews writings — everything short of where he went to summer camp . The questionnaire often runs hundreds of pages long . The F. B. I. will immediately begin a background check and the staff members of senators on the Judiciary Committee will start their own investigations . As others pore over documents the nominee will be calling and meeting with as many senators as possible . The meetings typically take 15 minutes to an hour said Stephen Wermiel a constitutional law professor at American University . The senators are typically looking to learn about how the nominee thinks and what makes the tick while the nominee is trying to learn what concerns the senators might have
" WASHINGTON — A year ago Judge Neil M. Gorsuch was midway down a ski slope when his cellphone rang . Justice Antonin Scalia he was told had died . “ I immediately lost what breath I had left ” Judge Gorsuch said in a speech two months later . “ And I am not embarrassed to admit that I couldn ’t see the rest of the way down the mountain for the tears . ” President Trump in nominating Judge Gorsuch to the Supreme Court has chosen a judge who not only admires the justice he would replace but also in many ways resembles him . He shares Justice Scalia ’s legal philosophy talent for vivid writing and love of the outdoors . Mr. Trump ’s selection of Judge Gorsuch was nonetheless a bit of a surprise coming from someone who had campaigned as a Washington outsider . Judge Gorsuch has deep roots in the city and the establishment Mr. Trump often criticized . His mother was a official in the Reagan administration . He spent part of his childhood in Washington and practiced law here for a decade at a prominent law firm and in the Justice Department . And like all of the current justices he is a product of the Ivy League having attended college at Columbia and law school at Harvard . Judge Gorsuch 49 — who was appointed to the United States Court of Appeals for the 10th Circuit in Denver by President George W. Bush — is an originalist meaning he tries to interpret the Constitution consistently with the understanding of those who drafted and adopted it . This approach leads him to generally but not uniformly conservative results . “ Ours is the job of interpreting the Constitution ” he wrote in a concurrence last year . “ And that document isn ’t some inkblot on which litigants may project their hopes and dreams . ” While he has not written extensively on several issues of importance to many conservatives including gun control and gay rights Judge Gorsuch has taken strong stands in favor of religious freedom
" NAIROBI Kenya — It started out in Washington . Then it went to Jakarta . Then across Africa . One version even showed up on Facebook . Within hours a State Department dissent cable asserting that President Trump ’s executive order to temporarily bar citizens from seven countries would not make the nation safer traveled like a chain letter — or a viral video . The cable wended its way through dozens of American embassies around the world quickly emerging as one of the broadest protests by American officials against their president ’s policies . And it is not over yet . By 4 p. m. on Tuesday the letter had attracted around 1000 signatures State Department officials said far more than any dissent cable in recent years . It was being delivered to management and department officials said more diplomats wanted to add their names to it . The State Department has 7600 Foreign Service officers and 11000 civil servants . The letter had been evolving since this weekend when the first draft emerged . It was edited as it moved along with some diplomats adding words and others striking out passages . For example one diplomat suggested this sentence should simply end on “ lasting shame ” : “ The decision to restrict the freedom of in the United States and foreign nationals who wanted to travel to or settle in the United States during the 1940 s has been a source of lasting shame for many in our country . ” Some officials who were trying to sign the document on Tuesday said it was not clear who was in charge or who was collecting signatures . The letter was passed through official State Department email accounts and on government time — several diplomats said union rules allowed them to work on dissent memos on the clock . “ Policy dissent is in our culture ” said one diplomat in Africa who did not want to speak publicly before the letter was released . “ We even have awards for it . ” The letter which harshly took apart the executive order said the visa ban would “ alienate allies ” and “ hurt America economically . ” Foreign travelers inject nearly $ 250 billion into the American economy
" During his first 11 days in office President Trump has provided news outlets with plenty of material at all hours of the morning and night . But his maelstrom of activity — the bold executive orders the fiery Twitter posts the brazen speeches — has also exposed and perhaps exacerbated ideological differences . For those devouring news about the administration the choice of narratives has become starker with brighter lines drawn around the content . For the readers and viewers it ’s follow the narrative of your choice and be wary of the great chasm between . Over the weekend as protesters descended on airports across the country in response to Mr. Trump ’s immigration ban fissures began to emerge even among news organizations . On Monday the divide only widened . And not everyone behaved predictably . Bill O’Reilly the outspoken Fox News host expressed skepticism about the rollout of Mr. Trump ’s plan and called it “ a mistake ” to rush it . While he did make some effort to defend Mr. Trump he was also somewhat moderate in one segment . “ It is certainly responsible and logical for a new president to institute updated protections for this country by ordering specific temporary immigration actions ” Mr. O’Reilly said . “ However it ’s also responsible for a federal judge to order that foreigners with the proper credentials already issued not be punished . There should be room for decision making . ” He even invoked the Statue of Liberty to make his point . Some of Mr. O’Reilly ’s guests were also critical . Karl Rove said of Mr. Trump that “ the controversy is hurting him more than the controversy is helping him . ” Brit Hume said it was handled “ very clumsily . ” And Charles Krauthammer said it was introduced in the “ most amateurish botched way . ” But
" The children around the world who need emergency international assistance the most come mainly from the countries singled out in President Trump ’s order barring entry to the United States according to a United Nations assessment . Five of the seven countries where children are most imperiled are on Mr. Trump ’s list of nations where visas are suspended : Iraq Somalia Sudan Syria and Yemen . The children most at risk are Syrian whether they have fled as refugees or are still in their country according to Unicef the United Nations ’ children ’s agency . All Syrians have been barred indefinitely from entering the United States under Mr. Trump ’s executive order . Other countries where Unicef says children are imperiled include the Democratic Republic of Congo Ethiopia Nigeria and South Sudan . They are not part of Mr. Trump ’s temporary ban on visas — though the order also bars all refugees regardless of where they come from for 120 days . “ This shows who the ban really impacts : the world ’s most vulnerable women and children who are fleeing terror ” said Jennifer Sime a senior vice president at the International Rescue Committee a humanitarian organization focused on refugees . “ America is turning away from its leadership role on refugee resettlement and it is refugees who are paying the price . ” The United Nations compiled the assessment weeks before Mr. Trump signed the executive order and published it on Tuesday . Here is what the Unicef report says the agency needs for the five countries included in the executive order where children are most at risk . The United Nations says it needs around $ 1 billion to aid children displaced by six years of conflict in Syria . Calling the Syrian refugee crisis “ the largest humanitarian crisis since the end of World War II ” Unicef says there are more than 2. 2 million children living as refugees in countries neighboring Syria . The organization is also asking for more than $ 300 million to help more than 5. 8 million children still living in the country . It says most of that money is needed for water sanitation hygiene and medical aid . Unicef is seeking about $ 200 million in aid for Yemen which is in a civil war and straining from a devastating famine . The organization says the bulk of that money would go to feed 6. 9 million children this year . More than 5. 1 million children are in need in Iraq
" AMSTERDAM — Pedram Paragomi a Iranian medical student was excited about his first trip to the United States . It had taken him a year to arrange a postdoctoral research post at the University of Pittsburgh . When he sat down in Seat 19E on a Boeing 777 operated by KLM out of Tehran early Saturday he felt that he had finally fulfilled his dream . “ It ’s the excitement you feel when you make a long trip to an unknown destination ” Mr. Paragomi said . It was not to be . Mr. Paragomi and six other Iranians remained stranded at Schiphol Airport outside Amsterdam on Tuesday as their travel ordeal stretched into its fourth day . They were among thousands of people affected by President Trump ’s executive order barring from the United States for 90 days travelers from seven predominantly Muslim countries : Iran Iraq Libya Somalia Sudan Syria and Yemen . The largely spontaneous and spirited protests at American airports over the weekend focused on several aspects of Mr. Trump ’s order including a ban on all refugees an indefinite ban on Syrian refugees and an attempt — later blocked by judges — to deport people with valid visas or refugee status who had already arrived in the United States . But many travelers were stuck in various states of limbo abroad — far from the sightlines of American protesters — and their plight has only slowly come to light in many cases through the efforts of volunteer lawyers who have been working on their cases . A Syrian man said that he had been blocked from flying from Abu Dhabi in the United Arab Emirates to the United States where he had a research position lined up at a university in North Dakota . He said Mr. Trump ’s order would affect his career . In an email to The New York Times
" WASHINGTON — Democrats on the Senate Finance Committee sought to stall the confirmations of Steven Mnuchin and Tom Price President Trump ’s picks for Treasury secretary and secretary of health and human services by refusing to attend scheduled votes on Tuesday . As Mr. Trump ’s dramatic firing of his acting attorney general threw the capital into tumult Democrats on Tuesday also seized on the contentiousness to try to block Senator Jeff Sessions ’s nomination as attorney general because they said he was too close to Mr. Trump . In describing their tactic of boycotting the votes on nominees to Treasury and to health and human services Senator Ron Wyden of Oregon said that recent news reports suggested Mr. Mnuchin and Mr. Price had given false statements in their nomination hearings . He said more information was needed before making judgments about the nominees . “ We have made clear that we need additional information ” Mr. Wyden said . Senator Debbie Stabenow Democrat of Michigan assailed the nominees for failing to be honest with the committee . “ The truth matters ” she said . “ That ’s not what has been happening here . ” Republicans expressed dismay at the delay . “ I think this is a completely unprecedented level of obstruction ” said Senator Patrick J. Toomey Republican from Pennsylvania . But with a Supreme Court vacancy nearing its point after a long blockade by Republicans Democrats were not exactly feeling the heat at least not yet . During a hearing before the Senate Judiciary Committee Democrats painted Mr. Sessions as an extremist legal savant for Mr. Trump in support of ideologies while Republicans portrayed him as a lawyer and prosecutor who would enforce the law as written . “ How could we possibly conclude that this nominee will be independent ? ” asked Senator Dianne Feinstein of California the top Democrat on the Senate Judiciary Committee . She said that Sally Q. Yates the former acting attorney general fired late Monday showed “ guts ” and independence in refusing to defend Mr. Trump ’s executive order banning immigrants from seven largely Muslim countries . “ I have no confidence that Senator Sessions will do that ” Ms. Feinstein said . Democrats hope to turn the tumult into a referendum on Mr. Sessions an Alabama Republican
" WASHINGTON — President Trump made clear in his fiery inaugural speech that he was going to challenge the Washington establishment . Now the establishment is quickly pushing back creating a palpable air of uncertainty and chaos in the opening days of his administration . The new president fired an acting attorney general who refused to defend the administration ’s executive order on immigration . Democrats on Tuesday boycotted Senate confirmation hearings to prevent votes on cabinet nominees . State Department employees opposed to the administration were urged to quit if they didn ’t like Mr. Trump ’s direction . Even after years of unbreakable gridlock and unyielding partisanship it was a jarring new level of confrontation and conflict and it was contributing to a building sense of crisis just as the new president was to disclose the identity of a new Supreme Court nominee — a selection certain to further inflame tensions . Republicans adjusting to the new era seemed blindsided by the rapid pace of events and the worrying failure of the new administration to engage in the and consultation that would typically accompany the issuance of a potentially explosive proposal like the freeze on visas for refugees and immigrants from select countries . “ It ’s regrettable that there was some confusion with the rollout ” Speaker Paul D. Ryan told reporters Tuesday noting that top Republicans learned of the contents of the order only as it was being issued . That secretive closely held approach may be the preferred choice of the president and disrupters like his senior adviser Stephen K. Bannon who is quickly emerging as the power in the West Wing but not by more conventional politicians who definitely don ’t like to be caught off guard . Representative Peter T. King Republican of New York said similar failings had emerged in the early days of previous administrations but would not be tolerated for long . “ You get a brief period you ’re allowed for a learning curve but after that you have to get your act together ” Mr. King said . One veteran of past Republican administrations acknowledging the Trump White House was still in its “ shakedown ” phase encouraged the president ’s staff to focus more on consultation to avert confusion . “ Process matters ” said Kenneth M. Duberstein who served as chief of staff to Ronald Reagan . “ You are dealing with not just senior management
" ATLANTA — As a young prosecutor in the late 1990 s Sally Q. Yates sat at a conference table with a former sheriff and began picking away at his story . With an F. B. I. agent watching Ms. Yates soon had the lawman in knots about a deposition . “ I watched him as she broke him down and he confessed that he had lied under oath ” the agent Oliver G. Halle now retired recalled on Tuesday . “ She can be very disarming but underneath that disarming appearance is a woman who knows how to fight . ” As acting attorney general Ms. Yates picked the fight of her life on Monday when she ordered the Justice Department not to defend President Trump ’s executive order blocking refugees and restricting immigration to the United States . Ms. Yates became convinced based on the president ’s own statements that he had intended to unlawfully single out Muslims senior officials said . “ We have comments from the president about what this is supposed to do ” Ms. Yates said in one meeting on Monday according to two people involved in the discussions . She later added “ The intent was clear from the face of it . ” Ms. Yates 56 was swiftly fired . Before she even finished packing up her office she had become a hero to many Democrats the face of a simmering resistance inside the government to Mr. Trump ’s administration . Her firing was a politically divisive turn in a career that had until now
2.0"Good morning . Here ’s what you need to know to start your day in Europe : • President Trump nominated a conservative judge from Denver Neil M. Gorsuch to the U. S. Supreme Court presaging yet another political battle in Washington . The nominee ’s legal philosophy echoes that of Justice Antonin Scalia whose seat he will fill if confirmed . In Congress Democrats sought to delay confirmation for Mr. Trump ’s cabinet picks after he fired the acting attorney general for defying his contentious immigration order . About 1000 American diplomats around the world have signed a dissent cable objecting to the order and legal challenges are mounting . We met seven Iranians stuck in Amsterdam who are among thousands of people affected by the measure . While the immigration order has prompted protests and raised anxiety in corporate America and among U. S. allies a broad swath of the U. S. electorate appears to welcome it . _____ • Donald Tusk the president of the European Council called President Trump a potential threat to the European Union saying his administration seemed to “ put into question the last 70 years of American foreign policy . ” Other foreign leaders also wonder whether they can depend on the U. S. to honor defense treaties and trade pacts given the new president ’s litany of impulsive statements and false claims . And Mr. Trump ’s top trade adviser waded into E. U. politics by accusing Germany of exploiting other European countries and the U. S. by keeping the euro artificially low . _____ • The war in eastern Ukraine has intensified with the government in Kiev and separatists blaming each other for the surge in violence . Kiev said it was preparing the evacuation of thousands of civilians from the city of Avdiivka after days of shelling there . _____ • Romania ’s government decriminalized official misconduct in some cases dealing a blow to a yearslong anticorruption campaign . Thousands of people took to the streets in protest and President Klaus Iohannis who serves in a largely ceremonial role called it “ a day of mourning for the rule of law . ” _____ • In France
" TORONTO — François Deschamps stepped out of his apartment building in the Limoilou neighborhood of Quebec City recently and stopped when he saw a sticker wrapped around a light pole . “ Burn Your Local Mosque ” it read around a silhouette of a mosque against an orange flame . He snapped a cellphone photo and added it to his collection of propaganda popping up around the city . Canada is a remarkably open society a legacy of liberal politicians who set the thinly populated country on the path of aggressive multiculturalism decades ago . Last week Statistics Canada reported that by 2036 nearly half of all Canadians would be immigrants or the children of immigrants — most of them what the country calls “ visible minorities ” which means nonwhite . That rapid transformation is stirring the most conservative elements of the white Canadian population who see the country as their own despite the fact that Europeans took the land from a patchwork of indigenous peoples who had long existed there . Few people believe that this stirring which is moderate by United States standards contributed directly the shooting Sunday inside Quebec City ’s largest mosque in which six worshipers were killed and eight injured . And no evidence yet has emerged that the accused assailant a Québécois university student had ties to specific groups . But the attack has put many on guard that Canada ’s embrace of Muslim immigration is raising tensions . Even the most radical groups seem to sense that expressing extreme views can be dangerous . There are at least 100 extremist groups in Canada according to two Canadian studies published last year with most of them active in the provinces of Ontario Quebec Alberta and British Columbia . While their targets include gays and lesbians Jews and other minorities Muslims have faced a sizable amount of the hostility . In 2014

" BRUSSELS — The president of the European Council warned Tuesday that President Trump was a potential threat to the European Union including the American leader ’s bellicose pronouncements with major geopolitical challenges like Russian aggression China ’s assertiveness and international terrorism . In a letter sent to European leaders Donald Tusk the council president wrote that those factors and “ worrying declarations by the new American administration all make our future highly unpredictable . ” He appeared to question whether the United States would maintain its commitment to European security under Mr. Trump ’s leadership . “ For the first time in our history in an increasingly multipolar external world so many are becoming openly or Eurosceptic at best ” Mr. Tusk wrote . The letter was released ahead of a European Union summit meeting in Malta on Friday Mr. Tusk is responsible for setting the agenda for the meetings . “ Particularly the change in Washington puts the European Union in a difficult situation with the new administration seeming to put into question the last 70 years of American foreign policy ” he wrote . The European Union has been struggling to contend with fractious internal forces . Among them : the vote by Britain to leave the bloc the organization ’s failure to establish a unified response to the arrival of hundreds of thousands of asylum seekers and the debt crisis that has driven many Greeks into poverty . And then there are external pressures like Russia ’s annexation of Crimea . Before the election and since taking office Mr. Trump has lauded the vote by Britain known as Brexit and said the country would thrive outside the European Union . He met with Nigel Farage a populist leader of the campaign to leave the bloc before seeing Prime Minister Theresa May . And at one point he went so far as to suggest that Mrs. May appoint Mr. Farage as Britain ’s ambassador to the United States . Mr. Trump has also praised President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia and indicated he would pursue friendlier relations with Moscow even as Russia encourages chaos on the European Union ’s eastern border . Mr. Tusk ’s letter does not reflect a new policy for the European Union and member states of the bloc are not required to act on Mr. Tusk ’s advice when they meet on Friday . But many European leaders have made their differences with Mr. Trump known . After the United States said it was temporarily blocking refugees from entering the country Chancellor Angela Merkel of Germany felt compelled to point out to Mr. Trump the obligations of nations under the Geneva Conventions to protect refugees of war on humanitarian grounds . And President François Hollande of France said he had reminded Mr. Trump that “ the ongoing fight to defend our democracy will be effective only if we sign up to respect to the founding principles and in particular
" For more than 400 employees recently laid off by Wells Fargo the aftermath of the bank ’s scandal over sham accounts has had an unexpected consequence : The bank is prohibited from paying the severance it owes them . In Wells Fargo ’s federal regulator the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency imposed additional restrictions on the troubled bank . The rules part of which are intended to curb golden parachute packages limit what payments Wells Fargo is permitted to make to terminated employees without explicit regulatory approval . Routine severance pay is sometimes exempted from such restrictions but the federal rules for golden parachute pay are complex and Wells Fargo ’s severance plan is not eligible for the exemption according to Diana Rodriguez a bank spokeswoman . Former employees at all levels of the company from branch workers to corporate executives are affected by the hold . Wells Fargo ’s severance packages typically run from six weeks of pay to as long as 16 months depending on the employee ’s length of service . The people affected are those whose jobs have been cut as part of Wells Fargo ’s regular business adjustments . They are not accused of wrongdoing . Workers who are fired for cause such as those involved in the scandal are not eligible for severance . In recent years the bank has terminated 5300 employees in connection with its misconduct . The bank has asked the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency for approval to make severance payments but has not yet received it Ms. Rodriguez said . The payments add up to several million dollars . Wells Fargo has temporarily stopped all layoffs until it can resolve the issue . The freeze began on Nov. 21 three days after the bank was notified of the additional restrictions . But about 400 workers who were terminated right before the additional restrictions were imposed are caught in limbo . Wells Fargo has told them that their severance payments are indefinitely delayed . “ We are deeply sorry for the hardship this creates for affected team members and we are doing everything in our power to resolve the situation as quickly as possible ” Ms. Rodriguez said .

" BEIJING — Zhang Heng barged through an door surprising a doctor and a patient . He didn ’t have time to knock . In Mr. Zhang ’s business every second counts . “ You have to hand it directly to the person ” said Mr. Zhang one of the legions of package couriers in Beijing who help power China ’s online shopping boom . He spoke as he blitzed through a surgical wing medical storeroom and patient ward delivering parcels small and large soft and square to doctors and nurses in an effort to ensure the right person gets the right package . “ Otherwise ” Mr. Zhang said “ you may get fined . ” The Chinese industry has been built on the backs of couriers — called kuaidi or express delivery in China — like Mr. Zhang . They number 1. 2 million by one survey and online retailers like Alibaba use them to zip packages to customers by scooter or electric cart . Across China the world ’s largest market for package delivery a courier shouting “ kuaidi ! ” through a door or a phone signals your package has arrived . But for the couriers — who are largely unskilled workers from China ’s interior — the work can be and difficult . It is coming under scrutiny from labor activists and legal experts who say many couriers face punishing hours and harsh working conditions . Nearly of them work more than 12 hours a day seven days a week according to the survey which covered 40000 couriers and was conducted by Beijing Jiaotong University and Alibaba ’s research and logistics arms . A majority work more than eight hours a day each day of the week . Labor standards in the industry vary widely
" HONG KONG — A billionaire who has forged financial ties with some of the country ’s most powerful families was taken by the Chinese police from his apartment at the Four Seasons Hotel in Hong Kong late last week and spirited across the border a person close to the businessman said on Tuesday . The billionaire Xiao Jianhua who has been missing since Friday is in police custody in China where he apparently is safe said the person who spoke on condition of anonymity for fear of arrest . Mr. Xiao is a Canadian citizen with an Antiguan diplomatic passport though he was born in China . His removal from Hong Kong appears to contravene the “ one country two systems ” rule that allows the former British colony to run its own affairs and bars the Chinese police from operating here . When asked on Tuesday about Mr. Xiao the Hong Kong police issued a statement saying that “ the subject ” had entered mainland China through a border crossing on Friday . His disappearance was reported the following day but on Sunday one of Mr. Xiao ’s family members reported that Mr. Xiao was safe and that the family had asked to withdraw the missing person ’s filing . Mr. Xiao 45 had spent years outside China most recently staying at the Four Seasons in Hong Kong . The situation is eerily reminiscent of the case of another holder the bookseller Lee Bo who disappeared off the streets of Hong Kong in late 2015 only to turn up days later in Chinese custody . His case as well as the disappearance of four of his business associates made headlines around the world and shook many people in Hong Kong who saw his abduction as a violation of the city state ’s ability to run its own affairs
" UNITED NATIONS — Already furious over President Trump ’s visa ban Iran warned the United States on Tuesday not to escalate tensions over tests of Iranian missiles — tests that his administration ’s new United Nations ambassador called “ absolutely unacceptable . ” The Iranian warning made in Tehran by Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif came a day after American and Israeli officials accused Iran of having conducted a missile test that they said had violated a United Nations Security Council resolution . The United States called an urgent meeting of the Council on Tuesday to discuss the grievance making Iran the subject of the first diplomatic skirmish at the United Nations by Nikki R. Haley the former governor of South Carolina who is Mr. Trump ’s new ambassador . “ The United States is not naïve ” she told reporters after the closed meeting . “ We ’re not going to stand by . You ’re going to see us call them out as we said we would and you are also going to see us act accordingly . ” Ms. Haley took no questions after her Security Council debut and proposed nothing concrete . The council agreed to refer the issue to its own sanctions committee for further inquiry which is what it did last year after the last missile test by Iran . Iran has not confirmed that it conducted a test . But Mr. Zarif at a joint news conference in Tehran with his visiting counterpart from France Ayrault said he hoped that the new American administration would not use Iran ’s military defenses “ as a pretext to create new tensions . ” When the nuclear deal with Iran was reached in 2015 with major powers including the United States they agreed sanctions on Iran would be relaxed in exchange for its verifiable pledges of peaceful nuclear work . A Security Council resolution “ called upon ” Iran not to undertake any tests of missiles designed to be capable of carrying nuclear warheads . Iran contends that it has not violated the resolution and that its missiles are not designed to carry nuclear warheads — which it already has promised not to make as part of the nuclear accord . Nonetheless the American and Israeli accusations have created what amounts to an early test of the Trump administration ’s toughness on Iran . During the presidential election campaign Mr. Trump denounced the nuclear agreement and sometimes conflated it with the Iranian missile program . Arms control experts have cautioned that Iran ’s missile tests are not prohibited under the nuclear accord . Ms. Haley used tough words about such tests but did not say whether her administration regarded them as a violation of the accord . “ We have said with this administration that we are not going to show a blind eye to these things that happen ” she said . “ We ’re going to act . We ’re going to be strong . We ’re going to be loud and we ’re going to do whatever it takes to protect the American people and the people across the world . ” Iran ’s United Nations mission added to Mr. Zarif ’s warning issuing a Foreign Ministry statement asserting that Iranian ballistic missiles are “ exclusively for legitimate defense . ” The statement said missile tests “ are an integral component ” of Iran ’s and that “ we reject politically motivated comments regarding Iran ’s missile program . ” Mr. Zarif also used the news conference on Tuesday to emphasize Iran ’s anger over the Trump administration ’s executive order on Friday suspending refugee admissions and prohibiting the issuance of visas to Iran and six other countries . Mr. Zarif called the order “ a shameful act . ” The order has upended the lives of thousands of Iranians who are by far the largest population affected among the seven countries which also include Iraq Libya
" MOSCOW — The war in eastern Ukraine that simmered quietly for months has erupted in a lethal bout of fighting in recent days . The violence which killed at least eight Ukrainian soldiers and three on the side shifted the front lines by only a few hundred yards in several spots but potentially complicates American efforts to improve relations with Russia . The United States Army helps to train and equip Ukrainian soldiers who are fighting separatists in two eastern provinces of Ukraine in the only active war in Europe today . In the latest outbreak the sides vied for control of what are known as “ gray zone ” territories areas between the front lines that had previously been in buffer zones . The Ukrainian Army advanced in at least two places according to news reports and official Ukrainian accounts but it said it did so to rebuff rebel attacks . Each side blamed the other for the escalation . Referring to one town an adviser to the Ukrainian Interior Ministry Yuri Kasyanov told Radio Free Europe on Tuesday “ The defenders of Avdiivka preferred to advance the line ” to a more defensible position . Ukraine ’s Foreign Affairs Ministry issued a statement appealing to Western governments to intervene diplomatically . “ For the last two days the Russian occupation forces carried out massive attacks across the line ” firing with rocket artillery heavy mortars and other weapons the statement said . European monitors reported heavy shelling of Avdiivka since Sunday . Journalists who visited the town reported evidence of a psychological warfare operation of a sophistication that suggested Russian involvement . Cellphones in the town received text messages addressed to Ukrainian soldiers who often carry phones saying “ You are just meat to your commanders . ” The shelling disrupted electrical and water supplies . The Ukrainian authorities set up heated shelters for residents whose homes had been damaged
" In the past five weeks you ’ve seen America inaugurate a president march for women ’s rights protest an immigration order and debate a Supreme Court nominee . Even if you ’ve only occasionally peeked at the news the shock of so many updates may have left you reeling . This is the moment for a vacation especially one where the focus isn ’t on screens . But it sounds easier than it is . “ Being so technologically connected all the time as many of us are is overwhelming and a break is a way to show yourself some love ” said Miriam Geiser a travel consultant with KK Travels Worldwide in Chicago who has planned getaways for clients and has taken several herself . “ A vacation is about slowing down and nurturing yourself so you feel truly mentally and physically rested at the end ” she said . Here is advice on how to take such a trip . D. I. Y. a Digital Detox You don ’t have to camp on a remote island to shed your devices . Leave your laptop and iPad at home and lock your cellphone in your hotel room safe using it only for emergencies . Sometimes just the idea of cutting the cord can lead to anxiety and the first few hours of such a trip can feel stressful but Ms. Geiser said that many of her clients who have taken digital detox trips report feeling liberated and peaceful by the second day of their vacation . Suggested destinations : Post Ranch Inn in Big Sur Calif. and any national park within driving distance . Painting Away the Pressure You don ’t have to be Picasso but a vacation incorporating art can inspire creativity in your everyday life according to Susan Sparks a travel adviser at Points of Interest Travel in Aspen
" DHAKA Bangladesh — Bangladesh ’s government is moving forward with a plan to relocate Rohingya refugees staying in camps near the country ’s largest tourist resort towns to a remote island that is underwater for much of the year . A cabinet order on Thursday directed officials to have the refugees transferred to Thengar Char an island in the Bay of Bengal that is lashed by high tides and submerged during the monsoon season . The suggestion that they be moved to the largely uninhabitable marshland several hours by boat from the mainland drew criticism from around the world . The relocation plan was last proposed in 2015 but the government quietly suspended it after criticism from international aid groups and rights activists . Its reinstatement follows the arrival of about 65000 Rohingya from Myanmar in October and November after a crackdown by Myanmar ’s army and attacks on security forces by Islamic insurgents . The United Nations has called the Rohingya a Muslim ethnic group denied citizenship in Myanmar the world ’s most persecuted minority . John McKissick head of the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees in the Bangladeshi city of Cox ’s Bazar near the Burmese border said in November that Myanmar ’s government was trying to achieve an “ ultimate goal of ethnic cleansing of the Muslim minority . ” Since 1992 about 32000 registered Rohingya have been living in two United Nations camps near Cox ’s Bazar but estimates of unregistered refugees range from 200000 to 500000 . Many of them live in two sprawling makeshift shelters close to the official camps while others are scattered across southeast Bangladesh . Talk of forced relocation worries refugees who have lived in the Cox ’s Bazar area for more than two decades . “ We have been here for a long time ” one of them Shafiul Mostafa said in a telephone interview on Tuesday from one of the camps . “ We have gotten to know our neighbors and we can speak the local dialect
" It ’s almost a coronation : Every year the Sundance Film Festival anoints a darling or two — indie who are poised to break out usually with their first feature . ( Geremy Jasper was one at the festival that just ended in Park City Utah . ) These lucky few tend to go on to or critical success maybe even the Oscars . Think Damien Chazelle whose “ Whiplash ” was the toast of the 2014 season his “ La La Land ” is now the . But what about the festival filmmakers whose works are lauded and distributed but whose career paths are less charmed ? After they ’ve packed up their snow gear there are tantalizing moments and deep frustrations . Many go on what ’s known as the “ water bottle tour ” meetings with development executives and agents in Los Angeles ( where you ’re more likely to leave with a bottle of Evian than a production deal ) . Most don ’t have new scripts ready a huge impediment said the producer Anne Carey . Then they struggle against the industry ’s narrow expectations . “ Any person coming out of Sundance is in a box particularly if you only have one film under your name ” said the filmmaker Justin Simien . “ And if you happen to be in the black box or the gay box or the woman box I think you ’re in a smaller box . ” Meanwhile the clock is ticking : “ You have a whole year and then there ’s a whole new batch of kids at Sundance and then it ’s their year ” said the director Kat Candler . “ Your spotlight has shifted . ” For three filmmakers — Mr. Simien 33 from Los Angeles Ms. Candler 42
" When the Boy Scouts of America announced Monday that transgender boys would be welcome to camp hike and earn merit badges alongside their peers the move brought praise from critics of the organization who for years have called for more inclusive membership rules . But the decision which came with little warning and reversed a more than stance of determining gender based on birth certificates further alienated many religious conservatives who were longtime advocates of the program . “ Now we see once again that the Boy Scouts really is committed to a culture war that evangelical Christians and many other Americans just can ’t accept ” said Russell Moore the president of the Ethics Religious Liberty Commission the public policy arm of the Southern Baptist Convention . Mr. Moore a former scout said Southern Baptist churches and others had been dismayed by Boy Scout policies for several years as the Scouts moved first to allow openly gay youth members and then openly gay adult leaders . Though several Southern Baptist congregations have stopped sponsoring Scout troops Mr. Moore said others had held out hope that the organization would return to a more conservative worldview . “ I think for some this will be the final sign that it ’s time to go ” Mr. Moore said . Whether the new rules would lead to an influx of transgender scouts seemed uncertain . Besides one highly publicized case of a transgender boy being excluded from a New Jersey Scouting unit there had been limited attention on the issue before this week . Boy Scouts officials declined to be interviewed and would not comment on how many youths the decision might affect . In a statement a spokeswoman for the Boy Scouts said it was “ no longer sufficient ” to rely on a birth certificate to determine gender . “ The B. S. A. is committed to identifying program options that will help us truly serve the whole family ” said the spokeswoman Effie Delimarkos
" SAN FRANCISCO — Uber is one step closer to its dream of a future — with a little help from a new partner . The company announced on Tuesday a partnership with Daimler under which the German automaker plans to build autonomous vehicles that will operate on Uber ’s transportation network . The move marks the first time a major automaker will provide its own vehicles — built entirely and without Uber ’s help — specifically to operate on the company ’s network . The agreement is not exclusive and Daimler may produce autonomous cars for Uber ’s competitors while Uber can also bring other automakers onto what it calls its “ open platform ” for ride hailing . The two companies said they expected Daimler ’s vehicles to reach Uber ’s network “ in the coming years . ” “ Auto manufacturers like Daimler are crucial to our strategy because Uber has no experience making cars — and in fact making cars is really hard ” Travis Kalanick Uber ’s chief executive said in a statement . “ We can combine Uber ’s global network with the vehicles of companies like Daimler so that Uber riders can have a great experience getting around their cities . ” Uber has a history of cooperating with automakers to jointly produce autonomous vehicles . The company has worked with Volvo to develop the XC90 a sport utility vehicle now being tested in Pittsburgh near Uber ’s research headquarters . Uber has also modified a fleet of Ford Fusion vehicles outfitting them with sensors and cameras for autonomous capabilities . Lyft Uber ’s largest competitor in the United States has also worked closely with a major automaker General Motors which is making its own vehicles for Lyft ’s network . Google struck a deal with Fiat Chrysler last year to work on vehicles . Uber stands to benefit from the Daimler partnership in several ways . Collaborating with automakers could reduce the perception that Uber is a threat to the sales of the auto industry for example . The company can also bolster its supply of vehicles to pick up a growing base of riders . Uber faced some setbacks with its experiments last year . It ended a pilot program in San Francisco in December after disagreeing with California ’s Department of Motor Vehicles over whether it had the proper permits for the test . Uber plans to begin a similar test in Phoenix in the coming months . “ Daimler aims to be a leader in autonomous driving ” Dieter Zetsche Daimler ’s chairman said in a statement . “ Together with Uber we seek to combine our strengths . ” "
" One way to regard the refugees in the news these frenzied past few days is as potential Americans individuals and families escaping bad situations who imagine themselves building new lives here . What these particular refugees could become in this country and how they could contribute to our society and culture is a question stuck in suspended animation . But we do have the power to look to the past . And in the literary realm it ’s unquestionable that refugees once here often make major contributions . Through the 20th century and into this one those fleeing political persecution or war have produced important works that we think of now as at least partly American from fiction about the harrowing experiences of exile and dislocation to political treatises by thinkers who want to understand why their homelands fell apart . This is a sampling of 25 of those works . Bertolt Brecht “ The Resistible Rise of Arturo Ui ” ( 1941 ) Country of origin : GermanyReason for leaving : Fled Nazi Germany for Denmark in 1933 and then came to the United States in 1941 when war broke out . Brecht always intended his satire about the ruthless ascension of a Chicago mobster to be performed on an American stage . He is mocking Adolf Hitler each dopey and villainous character having a Nazi counterpart in real life . The character of the populist bully who has a penchant for both public speaking and private was central in Brecht ’s mind during his wartime exile . Hans Augusto Rey and Margret Rey “ Curious George ” ( 1941 ) Country of origin : GermanyReason for Leaving : German Jews who escaped from their native Hamburg to Brazil and then France only to leave again for the United States in 1940 just as the Nazis invaded . The mischievous monkey who had a canny way of getting in and out of trouble originated in the minds of Hans Augusto and Margret Rey . They conceived of the character while themselves trying to outrun the Nazis finally escaping from France on homemade bicycles and carrying the manuscript with the first mention of George ( then called “ Zozo ” ) along with them . Karl Polanyi “ The Great Transformation ” ( 1944 ) Country of origin : AustriaReason for Leaving : With Hitler ’s rise prominent socialists like Polanyi were imperiled so he left for England in 1933 and then arrived in Vermont in 1940 . After settling down to teach at Bennington College Polanyi published his major work which looked at how the Industrial Revolution was so disruptive that it created the conditions for both Communism and fascism . But capitalism he argued
" WASHINGTON — Just five days after taking office over dinner with his newly installed secretary of defense and the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff President Trump was presented with the first of what will be many decisions : whether to approve a commando raid that risked the lives of American Special Operations forces and foreign civilians alike . President Barack Obama ’s national security aides had reviewed the plans for a risky attack on a small heavily guarded brick home of a senior Qaeda collaborator in a mountainous village in a remote part of central Yemen . But Mr. Obama did not act because the Pentagon wanted to launch the attack on a moonless night and the next one would come after his term had ended . With two of his closest advisers Jared Kushner and Stephen K. Bannon joining the dinner at the White House along with Defense Secretary Jim Mattis and Gen. Joseph F. Dunford Jr . Mr. Trump approved sending in the Navy ’s SEAL Team 6 hoping the raid early last Sunday would scoop up cellphones and laptop computers that could yield valuable clues about one of the world ’s most dangerous terrorist groups . Vice President Mike Pence and Michael T. Flynn the national security adviser also attended the dinner . As it turned out almost everything that could go wrong did . And on Wednesday Mr. Trump flew to Dover Air Force Base in Delaware to be present as the body of the American commando killed in the raid was returned home the first military death on the new commander in chief ’s watch . The death of Chief Petty Officer William Owens came after a chain of mishaps and misjudgments that plunged the elite commandos into a ferocious firefight that also left three others wounded and a $ 75 million aircraft deliberately destroyed . There are allegations — which the Pentagon acknowledged on Wednesday night are most likely correct — that the mission also killed several civilians including some children . The dead include by the account of Al Qaeda ’s branch in Yemen the daughter of Anwar the Qaeda leader who was killed in a targeted drone strike in 2011 . Mr. Trump on Sunday hailed his first counterterrorism operation as a success claiming the commandos captured “ important intelligence that will assist the U. S. in preventing terrorism against its citizens and people around the world . ” A statement by the military ’s Central Command on Wednesday night that acknowledged the likelihood of civilian casualties also said that the recovered materials had provided some initial information helpful to counterterrorism analysts . The statement did not provide details . But the mission ’s casualties raise doubts about the months of detailed planning that went into the operation during the Obama administration and whether the right questions were raised before its approval . Typically the president ’s advisers lay out the risks but Pentagon officials declined to characterize any discussions with Mr. Trump . A senior administration official said on Wednesday night that the Defense Department had conducted a legal review of the operation that Mr. Trump approved and that a Pentagon lawyer had signed off on it . Mr. Trump ’s new national security team led by Mr. Flynn the former head of the Defense Intelligence Agency and a retired general with experience in counterterrorism raids has said that it wants to speed the when it comes to such strikes
" WASHINGTON — President Trump seeming to relish a fight with Democrats over his nominee to the Supreme Court encouraged the Senate majority leader Mitch McConnell on Wednesday to invoke the nuclear option and abandon the threshold for confirmation . “ If we end up with that gridlock I would say ‘ If you can Mitch go nuclear ’ ” the president said . Democrats are weighing strategies for opposing the nomination of Judge Neil M. Gorsuch and debating how aggressively to pursue a battle over a seat that many of them believe was stolen from their party . In selecting a respected deeply conservative jurist Mr. Trump has dared Democrats to pursue the kind of blanket obstructionism that they long accused Republicans of embracing during the Obama administration . “ That would be an absolute shame if a man of this quality was put up to that neglect ” he said from the Roosevelt Room of the White House . For the Democrats who have struggled to match the fury and zeal of the party ’s base during the wave of activism since the election a showdown may prove unavoidable doubling as a referendum on resistance tactics to a White House that liberals fear . Democrats intend to repeatedly remind the public about the Republicans ’ treatment of Merrick B. Garland President Barack Obama ’s nominee to fill the vacant seat last year who was blocked from even receiving a hearing . Mr. McConnell had said a justice should not be seated during an election year even though there is no prohibition on such action . Now their gambit successful Republicans will seek to capitalize on the groundwork laid since Mr. Trump ’s election . Leading conservative groups have united for a campaign to help Judge Gorsuch
" MOSCOW — Vladimir V. Putin Russia ’s president hardly misses a chance to talk tough on terrorism once famously saying he would find Chechen terrorists sitting in the “ outhouse ” and “ rub them out . ” He and President Trump notably dismissive of political correctness would seem to have found common language on fighting terrorism — except on one point of well language . During his campaign Mr. Trump associated Islam with terrorism and criticized President Obama for declining to use the phrase “ radical Islamic terrorism . ” However Mr. Putin whom Mr. Trump so openly admires for his toughness has for more than a decade done exactly what President Obama did . He has never described terrorists as “ Islamic ” and has repeatedly gone out of his way to denounce such language . “ I would prefer Islam not be mentioned in vain alongside terrorism ” he said at a news conference in December answering a question about the Islamic State a group he often refers to as “ the Islamic State ” to emphasize a distinction with the Islamic religion . At the opening of a mosque in Moscow in 2015 Mr. Putin spoke of terrorists who “ cynically exploit religious feelings for political aims . ” In the Middle East Mr. Putin said at the mosque opening “ terrorists from the Islamic State are compromising a great world religion
" WASHINGTON — Rex W. Tillerson the former chairman and chief executive of Exxon Mobil was confirmed by the Senate on Wednesday in a vote to become the nation ’s 69th secretary of state just as serious strains have emerged with important international allies . The votes against Mr. Tillerson ’s confirmation were the most in Senate history for a secretary of state a reflection of Democratic unease with President Trump ’s early foreign policy pronouncements that threaten to upend a multilateral approach that has guided United States presidents since World War II . Thirteen senators voted in 2005 against Condoleezza Rice in the midst of a deteriorating Iraq war and in 1825 Henry Clay was confirmed 27 to 14 the record for votes against until Wednesday according to a tally provided by the Senate Historical Office . In a brief ceremony in the Oval Office on Wednesday evening Mr. Trump said Mr. Tillerson understood “ the importance of strengthening our alliances and forming new alliances to enhance our strategic interests and the safety of our people . ” Mr. Trump added “ It ’s time to bring a focus on foreign affairs to take a fresh look at the world around us and to seek new solutions grounded in very ancient truths . ” Mr. Tillerson thanked him and promised to “ represent the interests of all of the American people at all times . ” Mr. Tillerson is expected to appear at the State Department ’s Foggy Bottom headquarters on Thursday morning when he will address department employees . Mr. Trump ’s unapologetically nationalistic approach has put into question the value of many alliances and multilateral institutions . How Mr. Tillerson ’s translates Mr. Trump ’s vow of “ America First ” into the kind of polite diplomatic parlance that will maintain vital ties will be a significant test . Among his other challenges are dealing with Mr. Trump ’s promises to recast relations with China and Russia move the American Embassy in Israel to Jerusalem from Tel Aviv and an international nuclear deal with Iran . In a White House briefing on Wednesday Michael Flynn the national security adviser issued a stern warning to Iran . “ The Obama administration failed to respond adequately to Tehran ’s malign actions ” he said . Mr. Tillerson 64 a Texan
" UNITED NATIONS — The new secretary general of the United Nations said on Wednesday that the Trump administration ’s visa bans for citizens of seven nations “ violate our basic principles ” and would do little to stem the threat of terrorism . “ This is not the way to best protect the United States or any other country in relation to the serious concerns that exist of the possibilities of terrorist infiltration ” said the secretary general António Guterres in his first detailed remarks on President Trump ’s executive order which also indefinitely suspended Syrian refugee resettlement . “ I think these measures should be removed sooner rather than later . ” Mr. Guterres who took over as leader of the United Nations a month ago was for 10 years the head of the United Nations refugee agency . He said Syrians today had the most urgent need for protection . “ I strongly hope that the U. S. will be able to its very solid refugee protection in resettlement and I hope that the Syrians will not be excluded in that process ” Mr. Guterres told reporters at the United Nations headquarters . The secretary general stopped short of calling Mr. Trump ’s executive order illegal under international law . But asked whether it violates international obligations he said : “ I think that those measures indeed violate our basic principles . And I think that they are not effective if the objective is to really avoid terrorists to enter the United States . ” Mr. Guterres is under enormous pressure . On the one hand he must speak out against discrimination in keeping with the rules enshrined in international conventions . On the other he needs to avoid alienating the president of the United States which is the United Nations ’ biggest financial backer . Mr. Guterres declined to comment about the White House ’s reported threats to cut financial support to the United Nations saying he did not want to prejudge what has not yet been announced . “ When you talk too much about things that have not happened you trigger the happening of those things ” he said . He said he had held “ a very constructive discussion ” with the new United States ambassador to the United Nations Nikki R. Haley . “ What I am doing is to do everything I can to prove the added value of the U. N. to recognize the U. N. needs reforms to be totally committed to those reforms ” Mr. Guterres said . That he argued is “ the best way to get
" In a highly unusual turn of events for a sitting president a federal judge in Florida on Wednesday ordered a golf resort owned by President Trump to pay $ 5. 7 million for refusing to refund deposits to members who wanted to resign from the club . In his ruling the judge said that Mr. Trump by sending a letter in late 2012 denying access to members who wanted to resign from the Trump National Golf Club in Jupiter — a process that could take years — had set off a contract clause that should have resulted in an immediate refund of their membership fees . Instead the money was withheld . The decision is the first court judgment against a company owned by Mr. Trump since he became president last month and underscores that while Mr. Trump has stepped away from the operations of his company he is certain to remain dogged by legal controversies connected to his business . At his new hotel in Washington Mr. Trump is suing two celebrity chefs for breach of contract . The two men backed out of the Trump International Hotel development in 2015 after Mr. Trump made inflammatory comments about Mexican immigrants . Separately the federal government owns the building that houses the hotel and some legal experts have said that Mr. Trump may be in violation of his lease which appears to prohibit federal elected officials from leasing the building . And last month a lawsuit was filed in federal court in Manhattan contending that Mr. Trump had violated the emoluments clause of the Constitution by allowing his hotels and other businesses to accept payments from foreign governments . Mr. Trump has not sold any of his assets which include golf courses commercial real estate and marketing agreements . Rather he has handed the operations of his company over to his eldest sons Donald Jr . and Eric a move he hopes will reduce the appearance of conflict of interest . Wednesday ’s ruling — by Judge Kenneth Marra of Federal District Court in West Palm Beach an appointee of President George W. Bush ’s — calls for the club to pay $ 4. 85 million in withheld fees to 65 club members involved in the lawsuit plus an additional $ 925 000 in interest and other costs . As a result those members will receive refunds of $ 35 000 to $ 200

" On the eve of our debut episode of “ The Daily ” President Trump delivered a major news story . For his first Supreme Court nomination he selected Neil M. Gorsuch a conservative judge with a sterling résumé . I spent the night in the studio talking with some of my most insightful New York Times colleagues about what it means . Maggie Haberman a White House reporter explains Mr. Trump ’s reverence for the Supreme Court . Carl Hulse the dean of congressional reporters explains what to expect during the confirmation process . And Adam Liptak our chief legal correspondent introduces the country ’s new Supreme Court nominee . To understand more about Judge Gorsuch I also talk to David Green the chief executive of Hobby Lobby a company at the center of one of Judge Gorsuch ’s most important cases . He ruled that corporations with religious owners — like Hobby Lobby — cannot be required to pay for insurance coverage for contraception . “ We voted for Trump not that we agree with everything he does ” Mr. Green tells me on the show speaking for himself and his wife . “ The most important thing to us was the fact that we knew he would put someone there that ruled on the Constitution ” he said referring to the Supreme Court . “ Because if you rule on the Constitution it would be obvious that we would not have to be forced to do something and that we would have our religious liberties . ” Tune in and tell us what you think .

" Men whose prostate cancer comes back after surgery are more likely to survive if along with the usual radiation they also take drugs to block male hormones . The finding published Wednesday in The New England Journal of Medicine comes from a study that experts say will help clarify treatment for many patients . After surgery to remove the prostate more than 30 percent of men have a recurrence and until now there has not been clear evidence about the best way to stop the disease from killing them . Most are given radiation but prescribing drugs to counter the effects of male hormones has been inconsistent . The study paid for by the National Cancer Institute showed that among men who received radiation and hormonal treatment 76 . 3 percent were still alive after 12 years compared to 71 . 3 percent who had radiation alone . At 12 years the men who had both treatments were also much less likely to have died from their prostate cancer — 5. 8 percent versus 13 . 4 percent — or to have the cancer spread around their bodies — 14 . 5 percent versus 23 percent . “ This is a big deal ” said Dr. Ian M. Thompson Jr . of the Christus Santa Rosa Health System in San Antonio who was not part of the study but wrote an editorial accompanying it . “ There are so many things we do in prostate cancer that we don ’t know if they make a big difference in survival . This is one of the things where now we can say for sure . ” He added that he hoped the findings would change medical practice . The medical term for blocking male hormones is chemical castration and the treatments can cause hot flashes sexual problems and other side effects . So to put a man through it said Dr. Anthony L. Zietman an author of the study “ you ’d better have some decent justification . ” Dr. David F. Penson the chairman of urologic surgery at Vanderbilt University Medical Center
" The thing celebrity magazines never mention about Johnny Depp ’s current problems — the foreclosures on his homes how he was said to have cut off his fingertip in a marital dispute the fact he may need to sell a small French village to cover debts associated with the subsequent divorce — is how his challenges are relevant to the Trump administration . Mr. Depp has appeared in some of the ( “ Pirates of the Caribbean ” ) and weirdest ( “ Yoga Hosers ” ) films of the past 30 years earning him an estimated $ 650 million . Being a rich movie star however does not necessarily bring great financial savvy . Over the past decade Mr. Depp has paid more than $ 5. 6 million in interest on overdue taxes has lent millions of dollars to people unlikely to pay him back and has unwisely splurchased a number of questionable investments not the least of which is that town near St. . These money missteps Mr. Depp says are not his fault . Back in 1999 you see Mr. Depp hired a firm named the Management Group to oversee his finances . But instead of protecting his fortunes those financial advisers “ engaged in years of gross mismanagement and at times actual fraud ” according to a lawsuit Mr. Depp filed against the company . ( The Management Group filed a countersuit on Tuesday denying wrongdoing and arguing that it “ did everything possible to protect Depp from his own irresponsible and profligate spending . ” ) The alleged fiscal malfeasance visited upon Mr. Depp occurred over 16 years but the actor was unaware of this skulduggery his lawsuit asserts because he simply wasn ’t paying much attention to what was going on . Mr. Depp by his own admission
" Our objective in making this film was something of a psychology experiment : We sought to capture people facing a difficult situation to make a portrait of humans in doubt . We ’ve all seen actors playing doubt in fiction films but we have few true images of the feeling in documentaries . To make them we decided to put people in a situation powerful enough not to need any classic narrative framework . A high dive seemed like the perfect scenario . Through an online advertisement we found 67 people who had never been on a ( about 33 feet ) diving tower before and had never jumped from that high . We paid each of them the equivalent of about $ 30 to participate — which meant climbing up to the diving board and walking to its edge . We were as interested in the people who decided to climb back down as the ones jumping . We filmed it all with six cameras and several microphones . It was important for us not to conceal the fact that this was an arranged situation and thus we chose to show the microphones within the frame . Ultimately about 70 percent of those who climbed did jump . We noticed that the presence of the camera as well as the social pressure ( from those awaiting their turn beside the pool ) pushed some of the participants to jump which made their behavior even more interesting . In our films which we often call studies we want to portray human behavior rather than tell our own stories about it . We hope the result is a series of meaningful references in the form of moving images . “ Ten Meter Tower ” may take place in Sweden but we think it elucidates something essentially human that transcends culture and origins . Overcoming our most cautious impulses with bravery unites all humankind . It ’s something that has shaped us through the ages . ‘ Ten Meter Tower ’ appeared at the 2017 Sundance Film Festival . It is part of a series produced by independent filmmakers who have received support from the nonprofit Sundance Institute . "
" Inmates were holding two people hostage at a Delaware prison on Wednesday night in a standoff that began in the morning and left at least one prison employee injured officials said . The hostages were taken at the James T. Vaughn Correctional Center near the town of Smyrna between Wilmington and Dover . It is the state ’s largest prison with 2500 inmates in and units . At a news conference on Wednesday night officials revealed that a total of 27 inmates had been released by the but it was unclear whether they had been held against their will and how many inmates remained . Officials said four staff members had initially been taken hostage . Early accounts put that number at five though officials said one person had not been accounted for at first but was later found to be safe . Robert Coupe the secretary of the Delaware Department of Safety and Homeland Security said at the news conference at about 8:15 p. m. that the authorities were communicating with the inmates via a radio belonging to a correctional officer . Inmates also have access to television and may have been watching a live broadcast of the news conference he added . At 10:32 a. m. “ a correctional officer made a radio call for immediate assistance from within C Building which houses over 100 inmates ” Sgt. Richard Bratz of the Delaware State Police said at a news conference earlier on Wednesday . The building houses inmates who are making the transition to medium security . Other correction officers responded to the distress call and the prison was placed on lockdown but inmates took four employees hostage . At about 2:40 p. m. one hostage was set free and taken by ambulance to a hospital Sergeant Bratz said “ with injuries . ” Eight inmates were released at 5:20 p. m. Shortly before 8 p. m. another staff member and 19 inmates were released . Their conditions were not immediately known . The News Journal newspaper reported that a woman had called its newsroom stated that she was a hostage and haltingly read a statement that she said had been given to her by the inmates complaining of mistreatment . She said the prisoners had forbidden her to give her name and when asked how many inmates were holding her she said she did not know because “ they ’ve got my face covered . ” Officials declined to discuss specifics of the inmates ’ demands . Mr. Coupe said that once the takeover was resolved peacefully
" WASHINGTON — The Federal Reserve is waiting for more information about the Trump administration ’s economic plans just like everyone else . After its first policy making meeting of the year the Fed said on Wednesday that its economic outlook remained essentially unchanged since its previous meeting in December . The nation ’s economic expansion has continued with little sign in the latest data that it is flagging or accelerating . And as expected the Federal Open Market Committee which makes monetary policy left the Fed ’s benchmark interest rate unchanged . The question is what comes next . Fed officials said in the weeks before the meeting Wednesday that their uncertainty about the outlook had increased . President Trump has proposed significant shifts in economic policy — including changes in taxation regulation and trade — that could affect growth . “ The statement is written such that the F. O. M. C. will be able to adjust monetary policy as needed in response to the fiscal and trade policies of the administration ” said Michael Gapen chief United States economist at Barclays . At its December meeting the Fed raised its benchmark interest rate for just the second time since the financial crisis . After the increase of a quarter point the rate now ranges from 0 . 5 percent to 0 . 75 percent still very low by historical standards . Low rates encourage borrowing and contributing to faster economic growth . By raising rates the Fed is gradually reducing the force of that stimulus . Fed officials predicted in December that they would raise the benchmark rate three times this year . But they have cautioned that changes in fiscal policy could alter those plans . If Mr. Trump and congressional Republicans seek to increase growth for example by cutting taxes or spending a lot on infrastructure and the military the Fed could raise rates more quickly . If Mr. Trump ’s policies weigh on growth the Fed could move more slowly . The only hint of those pressures in the Fed ’s latest statement was a mention of increased public optimism about the outlook for the nation ’s economy . “ Measures of consumer and business sentiment have improved of late ” it said . Fed officials are watching fiscal policy makers closely because the Fed has concluded that the American economy is growing at something close to the maximum sustainable pace meaning that in the Fed ’s view
" NEW DELHI — Three years ago Dr. Rajesh Yadav an investigator with the India Epidemic Intelligence Service moved to the city of Muzaffarpur the site of one of the country ’s most mysterious outbreaks . And he waited . Every year in as temperatures reached scorching heights parents took children who had been healthy the night before to the hospital . The children awakened with a cry in the early morning many parents said . Then the youths began having seizures and slipping into comas . In about 40 percent of cases they died . Every year in July with the arrival of monsoon rains the outbreak ended as suddenly as it began . Beginning in 1995 investigations variously ascribed the phenomenon to heat stroke to infections carried by rats bats or sand flies or to pesticides used in the region ’s ubiquitous lychee orchards . But there were few signposts for investigators . Instead of occurring in clusters the illness typically struck only one child in a village often leaving even siblings unaffected . A joint investigation by India ’s National Center for Disease Control and the India office of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in Atlanta published in the British medical journal The Lancet Global Health on Tuesday has identified a surprising culprit : the lychee fruit itself when eaten on an empty stomach by malnourished children . In 2015 as a result of the investigation health officials began urging parents in the area to be sure to feed young children an evening meal and to limit their consumption of lychees ( sometimes spelled litchi ) . In two seasons the number of reported cases per year dropped to less than 50 from hundreds . “ It was an unexplained illness for so many years ” said Padmini Srikantiah

" BARCELONA Spain — President Trump ’s travel ban disrupted the plans of hundreds of people around the globe but perhaps none more vulnerable than Sham Aldaher a Syrian refugee girl and her family . Sham now 1½ was born without an eye and with a seriously disfigured face . Following two complex operations at a Barcelona hospital Sham is due to receive an eye prosthesis next Wednesday . Her family had then planned to resettle in the United States . They had already completed the required interviews and cleared all security checks before the plans were blocked by Mr. Trump ’s executive order to bar citizens from Syria and six other countries seen as threatening to America ’s safety . “ They were and they are now barred ” said Jayne Fleming the head of the human rights team at Reed Smith an American law firm that has been helping Sham and her family . Ms. Fleming and her team are now scrambling to see whether Britain Germany or another country could instead welcome the family . “ They ’re distressed over not knowing what the future holds for them . ” The Aldahers ’ story is a nomadic tragedy telling of the accumulated hardships that have been piled on many Syrian refugees . It is also a small but striking example of the broader crisis highlighted in a United Nations report issued on Tuesday showing that the children most in need of emergency international assistance come from five of the seven countries covered by Mr. Trump ’s order . Sham ’s parents left Syria and their jobs as teachers in 2013 . They traveled with their three children to Lebanon and then Egypt . But their arrival coincided with the unrest and military coup that removed Mohamed Morsi as Egypt ’s president . “ We left our home to find safety but in Egypt there were bombings in the night and the children were very afraid ” said Ali Aldaher Sham ’s father . So the family packed up again to join thousands of other Syrian refugees in Jordan . Sham was born there in July 2015 on the day of the Muslim holiday of Eid . The coincidence was seen as a blessing by her parents but it complicated Sham ’s birth as most local hospital workers were on vacation and the family could not find a doctor . Even though a midwife eventually assisted in the birth Sham ’s mother “ did not receive the health care she needed and I ’m sure all the stress hurt
" SAN FRANCISCO — From the spread of fake news to a nasty court fight in Texas it has been a rough few months for Facebook . But company executives can take heart in two things : Despite an audience nudging toward two billion users more and more people are still flocking to the service and more and more advertisers are spending money on it . Facebook ’s sales announced Wednesday handily beat Wall Street estimates . And even a $ 500 million jury verdict that went against the company earlier in the day did little to diminish enthusiasm about its finances . Facebook said sales had totaled $ 8. 8 billion in the fourth quarter of 2016 up 51 percent compared with a year ago surpassing analysts ’ expectations of $ 8. 5 billion . Not surprisingly user growth is at a peak . The announcement of the blockbuster quarter comes as Facebook grapples with complaints that it has not done enough to stem the rise of false news stories and misinformation across the social network . Since those complaints began to mount Facebook has started to address the problem . “ In the past we ’ve taken steps to reduce spam and clickbait and now we ’re approaching misinformation and hoaxes the same way ” Mark Zuckerberg Facebook ’s chief executive said during a conference call with investors . He pointed to the company ’s closer ties to publishers and organizations and the high priority it had placed on making changes to its news feed and ad network . The controversy over fake news seemed to have little effect on users ’ appetite for the website . Total profit for the quarter was $ 3. 6 billion annual ad revenue was up roughly $ 10 billion compared with 2015 and more than half of the site ’s 1. 86 billion regular visitors used it daily . Against that backdrop a jury verdict on Wednesday in a legal fight in federal court in Texas over virtual reality technology made by Facebook ’s Oculus division did not appear to faze company executives . “ The verdict is nonmaterial to our business ” Sheryl K. Sandberg Facebook ’s chief operating officer said in an interview . “ We had a really strong quarter capping off a really great year . ” Facebook paid $ 2 billion to acquire Oculus
" That collective shriek of joy you ’re hearing from the BeyHive ? Beyoncé and Jay Z are expecting twins . Beyoncé the cultural and music powerhouse dropped the news in an Instagram post on Wednesday afternoon with a picture showing her cradling a baby bump : The announcement was yet another example of the Beyoncé ’s penchant for tightly controlling her own narrative . She revealed she was pregnant in 2011 with a knowing belly rub at the MTV Video Music Awards after a spirited performance of “ Love on Top ” — and a microphone drop . ( A quick camera cut to Jay Z born Shawn Carter smiling as Kanye West shook his rapper friend by the shoulders confirmed the message . ) Their daughter Blue Ivy Carter was born on Jan. 72012 . While Beyoncé is famously averse to interviews and rarely discusses her personal life without setting the terms she put the spotlight on her marriage with the release last year of the album and HBO film “ Lemonade . ” It told the story of a struggling relationship including explicit infidelity and eventually reconciliation . Many assumed the songs ’ lyrics — which ranged from heartbroken to defiant to forgiving — were autobiographical though the couple never revealed how much of the story was based in reality . ( In her 2013 documentary “ Life Is But a Dream ” Beyoncé discussed having an earlier miscarriage . “ About two years ago I was pregnant for the first time ” she said . “ I flew back to New York to get my checkup — and no heartbeat . ” Jay Z alluded to the experience in his song “ Glory . ” ) “ Lemonade ” is nominated for a leading nine Grammy Awards at the ceremony to be held on Feb. 12 . Beyoncé is also scheduled to headline the second night of the Coachella festival in the California desert on April 15 and April 22 . Things seem to be going well for the couple now — Beyoncé ’s Instagram post was signed “ The Carters . ” The pair ’s fervent and loyal fans responded with typical enthusiasm to the announcement : Twitter said more than half a million tweets were sent about the pregnancy within 45 minutes . Some Coachella ticket holders wondered about the status of Beyoncé ’s scheduled performance . A representative for the singer did not immediately respond to a request for comment . Jay Z and Beyoncé are not the only musical duo with baby news . Pharrell Williams and his wife Helen Lasichanh recently welcomed triplets
" The reaction on social media to the news that Beyoncé is pregnant with twins was by turns swift sweet and strange . While Beyonce ’s Super Bowl performance of the hit song “ Formation ” was seen as a pointed political statement addressing issues like black pride and police brutality it and the video drew anger from some in law enforcement who said they were an attack on their profession . Then there were others like the police officer in Virginia who recreated her formidable choreography to inspire high school students . A phone call to the Atlanta department seeking comment was not immediately returned on Wednesday . "
" She had her fun and it appears she was ready to come home . After a brief flirtation with freedom Ollie a bobcat living at the Smithsonian ’s National Zoo in Washington was found on Wednesday near the zoo ’s birdhouse officials said . Though they could not retrace the bobcat ’s nearly adventure officials said she might have left the property but most likely never strayed more than two miles from the zoo . “ We ’re just happy ” Craig Saffoe the zoo ’s curator of great cats said at an evening news conference . Ollie ’s disappearance on Monday morning reportedly led some area schools to cancel recess and inspired a slew of jokes a Twitter parody account and grand metaphors . ( She had become “ a symbol of freedom and one of its last hopes in a world gone rotten ” The Washingtonian proclaimed on Wednesday night . ) But for zoo officials her capture thanks to a tip from a visitor who spotted her crossing a walkway offered relief . After receiving the tip staff members at the birdhouse notified Mr. Saffoe and his colleagues who set up live traps in the area of the sighting . “ Within 15 minutes the birdhouse keepers called us back and told us ‘ We have a bobcat in a trap up here ’ ” he said . Ollie was taken to a veterinary hospital
" We ’re about 600 to 3000 feet below the ocean ’s surface . It ’s cold it ’s dark and it ’s slow down here . If you ’re lucky it ’s blue in the daytime and black at night . And the deeper we go the darker it gets . Welcome to the twilight zone fishies . There ’s not much to eat and no green plants growing either . Here you eat what you can get and find a way to eat it or you starve . It ’s weird down here in the mesopelagic zone of the deep sea . Creatures can be sluggish but they are well adapted . Some use big eyes to find prey . Others make their own flashlights . Big mouths help predators eat big prey . That may be why barbeled dragonfishes have special head joints that allow them to open up their mouths 120 degrees and swallow big prey whole . This flexible head joint described for the first time in a study published on Wednesday in the journal PLOS One is unlike any other known to science . Nalani Schnell a zoologist at the French National Museum of Natural History had already discovered that different groups of barbeled dragonfishes had an unusual gap between their heads and necks that other fishes don ’t have . Some gaps were the result of a missing first vertebrae . Others resulted from the absence of a spine filled in instead with an elongated notochord a flexible rod made up of something similar to cartilage . To find out the function of these gaps Dr. Schnell teamed up with Dave Johnson a zoologist at the Smithsonian National Museum of Natural History . Together they obtained five divergent groups of the species from museum collections macerated the flesh from their bodies and stained the bones different colors . This allowed them to actually move the bones around
" At last weekend ’s round of movie and television awards doled out by the producers ’ and actors ’ guilds the likes of John Legend and Julia among others swung hard at President Trump and his travel ban to rapturous applause . The friendly reception to hostile fire represented a departure for awards shows where political acceptance speeches have elicited reactions from eye rolls to noisy dissent . In 1973 the Native American actress and activist Sacheen Littlefeather was met with jeers and later she said Hollywood blacklisting after Marlon Brando sent her to refuse an Oscar on his behalf . After Vanessa Redgrave a supporter of Palestinian rights deplored “ Zionist hoodlums ” while accepting her Oscar in 1978 the screenwriter Paddy Chayefsky drew hearty applause for upbraiding “ people exploiting the occasion of the Academy Awards for the propagation of their own personal political propaganda . ” Boos rained down on Michael Moore winner of the 2003 documentary prize for tearing into George W. Bush ’s newly started Iraq war . Getting political at the Oscars was risky and the assorted causes were always scattershot . But now Hollywood finds itself in 2017 . If current trends hold using stage time at the Academy Awards to take a stand won ’t be just de rigueur but expected . Mr. Trump ’s travel ban along with his combative rhetoric and internet outbursts have directly shaped this year ’s awards race . And Hollywood ’s ever more polarized with him has imbued the season with a heightened sense of both superfluousness and purpose . On the one hand against a backdrop of geopolitical unrest the monthslong circuit has felt
" TAVEUNI ISLAND Fiji — In Fiji flowers can take on a spiritual magical significance . They are strung together as garlands for ceremonies and festivals or worn as an ornament behind the ear on any given day . The South Pacific archipelago is home to about 800 species of plants found nowhere else in the world . But the most special is the tagimoucia a crimson and white flower that hangs down in clusters like a chain of ruby raindrops . Because of its beauty and rarity it has attained a kind of celebrity status . “ Just to touch it and see it with my own eyes ” said Lina Sena 41 her sentence trailing off as she held a clipping recently . “ See how we are treating it ? It is history . ” Except for scattered sightings on a neighboring island the flower grows only on a single mountain ridge on Taveuni one of the northern islands . The tagimoucia is the unofficial floral emblem of Fiji and has a prime position on the nation ’s $ 50 bill . But to Fijians its significance stems from several legends of romance and heartbreak . Seeing the flower “ was on my bucket list ” said Ravi Kumar 31 who grew up in Fiji but later moved to Australia . Mr. Kumar spent a recent day on Taveuni traipsing through the forest before finally sighting the flower atop its woody vine . Taveuni known as the Garden Island for its rich volcanic soil and farming is crowned with dense dark rain forest that is often shrouded in mist . Mr. Kumar said he made the trek because the flower ’s legend was “ one of the tales you grew up with ” in Fiji . Those tales can vary depending on whom you ask . The song “ Tagimaucia ga ” by Percy Bucknell a traditional composer describes how an outsider seized power on Taveuni and made the flower a symbol of his chieftainship . Another tells of a young girl whose tears became tagimoucia flowers when her parents scolded her for not doing her housework . According to Emori Tokalau
" Just days before a public town meeting on Tuesday night Jess Herbst the mayor of New Hope Tex . had an official announcement . “ I am transgender . ” The statement said that she had transitioned and would no longer use the name Jeff . The message was a few hundred words long and appeared on the home screen of the official website of New Hope a town of more than 630 residents about 40 miles north of Dallas . But she appeared to break barriers for the state . “ As far as I know I am the first openly transgender mayor on record in the state of Texas there could be others who never came out ” Ms. Herbst said in an interview on Wednesday . “ But I am the first to say ‘ Yes I am transgender and a seated mayor . ’ ” Ms. Herbst informed residents in a statement on the town ’s website about the change and the joys of her life as a woman including her preference in pronouns and the endurance of her marriage . “ As your mayor I must tell you about something that has been with me since my earliest memories ” Ms. Herbst wrote . “ I am Transgender . Two years ago with the support of my wife daughters and I began hormone replacement therapy ( HRT ) . “ At the time I did not imagine I would hold the mayor ’s position but here I am . ” Ms. Herbst has been active in local government since 2003 as an elected alderman road commissioner and mayor pro tempore . In 2016 she was appointed New Hope ’s mayor after the previous official in that post died . As of Wednesday morning the New Hope town website was still referring to her as Mayor Jeff Herbst . But Ms. Herbst implied in her statement that she was patient : “ I ’m not especially sensitive to the pronoun I ’m called and I expect people to take time to make the change . I use the name Jess a simple change from Jeff . ” “ I live my life as a female now and I will be performing my duties to the town as such
" PARIS — New embezzlement allegations emerged on Wednesday against the French presidential candidate François Fillon adding uncertainty to an already tightly contested election . Mr. Fillon ’s campaign was thrown into turmoil last week after Le Canard Enchaîné a weekly newspaper that mixes satire and investigations reported that his wife Penelope Fillon was paid with taxpayer money for a bogus job as a parliamentary assistant to her husband and his deputy in the National Assembly the lower house of Parliament . On Wednesday the newspaper published new accusations reporting that Ms. Fillon had held the bogus job for even longer than initially reported — from 1988 to 1990 between 1998 and 2007 and finally from 2012 to 2013 — and that she had been paid 831440 euros or nearly $ 900 000 much more than the figure published last week . Mr. Fillon a former prime minister won primary elections in November to become the candidate for the Republicans party . But the allegations have seriously damaged his presidential bid and the French media which until last week portrayed him as the favorite is now openly wondering who might replace him if he drops out of the race . The allegations are especially damaging for Mr. Fillon because he has pledged to reduce wasteful spending and has fashioned himself as a stern and honest politician untouched by the corruption scandals that have plagued some of his opponents . Le Canard Enchaîné also reported that Mr. Fillon paid two of his five children as parliamentary aides when he was in the Senate
" Of course reality intruded . Fabulousness is no barricade against politics . Reacting to President Trump ’s executive order banning the entry of citizens from seven nations and refugees from any country designers who are showing their work during the four days of men ’s fashion in New York expressed dissent in gestures that while mainly small and symbolic added gravitas to the usual antics and overall frivolity . models in Robert James ’s show at the New York Men ’s Day event on Monday carried placards with pointed messages : “ Made in a Sanctuary City ” and “ Bridges Not Walls . ” At a Private Policy presentation that afternoon members of a multiracial cast clad in quilted bomber jackets and hot pants had words like “ terrorist ” stenciled on foreheads or cheeks . Taking a bow at the end of a show on Tuesday in which models ’ faces were obscured behind neoprene ski masks the designer Robert Geller wore a sweatshirt that read : “ Immigrant . ” And in a spirited introduction to Nick Graham ’s collection on Tuesday presented against a giant projection of Earth seen from space Bill Nye — the “ Science Guy ” — addressed deniers with a paean to our fragile atmosphere . You only have to go backstage to see models from nearly every point on the globe — India Mongolia China and Sudan were just some of the countries that have been represented here this week — and to understand that fashion is a plurality undertaking . Sure the panoply of multiethnic faces is a relatively new addition to a business not always known for welcoming diversity . Yet behind the scenes fashion has always been global as Fern Mallis the former executive director of the Council of Fashion Designers of America said Tuesday afternoon . “ You have no idea how many visa forms I filled out in my career ” Ms. Mallis said referring to her work on behalf of the craftspeople from distant countries whose skills were essential if American designers ’ visions were to be realized . The garment industry itself was built by immigrants Ms. Mallis noted of a business that continues to be one of the city ’s top economic drivers . societal anxieties seemed to inject themselves into the proceedings in other ways .

On the Mend app users are introduced to an animated avatar of the Mend founder Ellen Huerta and her reassuring voice offers guidance on how to move forward with topics like “ detoxing ” from your ex redefining your sense of self — even how to get a better night ’s sleep . “ It ’s this charming and endearing voice of a friend ” Ms. Scinto said . “ And there ’s a line ‘ We never get tired of hearing about your breakup ’ and those words are like an oasis in the desert . ” Geri Dugan who works as a psychiatric nurse practitioner in Chicago knows all too well the mixed emotions that come after a love affair ends . After being stunned by a relationship that didn ’t work out she said she felt like an “ emotional basket case . ” Ms. Dugan found Mend through Ms. Huerta ’s podcast “ Love Is Like a Plant . ” Now
" “ Cops don ’t even want to make a damn traffic stop . Afraid they ’ll wind up on Anderson Cooper . ” “ Maybe [ the police ] are not going to have to be so politically correct . Maybe they ’re being overly politically correct . ” The first quotation is from Frank Rourke ( Bill Paxton ) the morally suspect but brutally effective Los Angeles police detective at the center of CBS ’s “ Training Day . ” The second is from the new president of the United States . If you have a hard time telling them apart who can blame you ? The candidate Donald J. Trump running on “ law and order ” rhetoric borrowed from Richard M. Nixon talked crime as if he were recapping a ’70s cop drama . He repeatedly — and falsely — claimed that United States murder rates were the highest in 45 years . Cities to him were lawless hellscapes : “ You walk down the street you get shot . ” That ’s essentially the outlook of two new police shows — “ Training Day ” and Fox ’s “ A. P. B. ” — each of which depicts American cities as zones that need a tough boor to break rules crack skulls and restore order . In the 2001 film “ Training Day ” Denzel Washington played a corrupt narcotics detective with a knack for busting drug gangs and a weakness for skimming the take . CBS ’s “ Training Day ” beginning on Thursday and set in the present has a tenuous connection to the original . Antoine Fuqua the film ’s director is among the producers ( who also include Jerry Bruckheimer of “ C. S. I. ” ) . But it perverts the dynamic of the film by making its central cop into a charming roguish maverick . Here Frank is partnered with Kyle Craig ( Justin Cornwell ) an idealistic “ trainee ” who is actually working undercover to investigate whether Frank has been crossing ethical lines . He has and he ’s damn proud of it . On their first outing Frank lays out his philosophy : “ Police work ’s like sex Kyle . It ’s a lot more effective if it isn ’t pretty . ” ( I would not recommend this as a pickup line . ) They cruise the squalid streets as Frank cites some statistics of Trumpian dubiousness : Crime is “ up 300 percent
" After an explosive fight with her boyfriend Melissa Monserrate 18 at the time and five months pregnant shut herself in the bathroom and put a razor blade to her wrist . Her boyfriend found her before she could hurt herself . On that night in December 2009 he stood guard by the door until the morning making sure she did not leave to try to harm herself again . She had just moved out of her mother ’s apartment in Ridgewood Queens and begun living with her boyfriend and his family . The pregnancy was unplanned and difficult for Ms. Monserrate who said she came from an unsupportive home environment . She discovered she was pregnant the summer before her senior year of high school and kept the news from her parents until she could no longer hide it . She missed 60 days of school because of complications from the pregnancy and had to have a minor operation but worked hard to catch up on missed class . She managed to graduate on time .

Describing her home life as “ very chaotic ” she recalled arguments between her mother and stepfather that became physical . Once
" WASHINGTON — President Trump after promising a radical break with the foreign policy of Barack Obama is embracing some key pillars of the former administration ’s strategy including warning Israel to curb settlement construction demanding that Russia withdraw from Crimea and threatening Iran with sanctions for ballistic missile tests . In the most startling shift the White House issued an unexpected statement appealing to the Israeli government not to expand the construction of Jewish settlements beyond their current borders in East Jerusalem and the West Bank . Such expansion it said “ may not be helpful in achieving ” the goal of peace . At the United Nations Ambassador Nikki R. Haley declared that the United States would not lift sanctions against Russia until it stopped destabilizing Ukraine and pulled troops out of Crimea . On Iran the administration is preparing economic sanctions similar to those the Obama administration imposed just over a year ago . The White House has also shown no indication that it plans to rip up Mr. Obama ’s landmark nuclear deal despite Mr. Trump ’s withering criticism of it during the presidential campaign . New administrations often fail to change the foreign policies of their predecessors as radically as they promised in large part because statecraft is so different from campaigning . And of course today ’s positions could shift over time . There is no doubt the Trump administration has staked out new ground on trade and immigration upending relations with Mexico and large parts of the Muslim world in the process . But the administration ’s reversals were particularly stark because they came after days of tempestuous phone calls between Mr. Trump and foreign leaders in which he gleefully challenged diplomatic orthodoxy and appeared to jeopardize one relationship after another . Mr. Trump made warmer relations with Russia the centerpiece of his foreign policy during the campaign and European leaders had been steeling for him to lift sanctions they and Mr. Obama imposed on President Vladimir V. Putin after he annexed Crimea . But on Thursday Mr. Trump ’s United Nations ambassador Ms. Haley sounded a lot like her predecessor Samantha Power . “ We do want to better our relations with Russia
" BEIJING — President Trump ’s combative phone call with Australia ’s prime minister over a refugee agreement has set off a political storm in that country one that threatens to weaken support for a alliance with the United States just as many Australians say they want closer ties with China . Enthusiasm for the alliance in Australia one of America ’s closest partners which hosts American spy facilities and rotations of American Marines had already been under pressure from China with which Australia conducts the most trade . Reports that Mr. Trump had scolded Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull on Saturday before abruptly ending the call are likely to further undermine confidence in the United States Australian analysts said . “ Trump is needlessly damaging the deep trust that binds one of America ’s closest alliances ” said Professor Rory Medcalf head of the National Security College at the Australian National University in Canberra . “ China and those wishing to weaken the strongest alliance in the Pacific will see opportunity in this moment . ” In less than two weeks in office Mr. Trump ’s actions have strained alliances and alienated potential partners of the United States and his phone call with Mr. Turnbull seemed to be one more example this time with a country that has fought on America ’s side since World War I. His administration ’s confrontational stance on Iran has undermined liberal voices in that country his restrictions on immigration from some predominantly Muslim countries have been widely criticized by allies and his rejection of the Partnership trade deal threatens to push countries in the region including Australia closer to China . Like many countries in the region Australia depends on the United States for its security but looks to China for its economic and it does not want to choose definitively between the two as they wage a global contest for power . Experts said the American and Australian militaries were sufficiently intertwined — the Royal Australian Air Force has flown in Syria and Australian soldiers have helped train the Iraqi Army — that the countries ’ security arrangements would endure . But the trust and confidence underlying the longstanding alliance will be harmed by Mr. Trump ’s apparent lack of respect and his remarks will be very costly in the public domain they said . The phone call on Saturday became contentious after Mr. Turnbull pressed Mr. Trump to honor a deal in which the United States had agreed to take in up to 1250 refugees being held by Australia at offshore detention centers . Under the terms of the deal
2.0"TEHRAN — Until two weeks ago Iran ’s clerics felt comfortable leading worshipers in a chorus of “ Death to America ” while simultaneously signing a $ 16 . 6 billion deal with Boeing . Now that status quo seems very long ago and the establishment is treading carefully with even most concerned that the smallest provocation could lead to military conflict . But some question how long their caution will last in the face of a Trump administration that has brought a new level of hostility and confrontation to a relationship that under President Barack Obama had been brittle but stable . Tensions flared this week after Iran confirmed that it had conducted a missile test and the national security adviser Michael T. Flynn warned Iran that it had been put “ on notice . ” On Thursday Iran ’s Foreign Ministry spokesman Bahram Qassemi gave a mild rejoinder saying “ It is a shame that the U. S. government instead of thanking the Iranian nation for their continued fight against terrorism keeps repeating unfounded claims and adopts unwise policies that are effectively helping terrorist groups . ” Mr. Flynn also made clear that the challenge to Iran extended beyond the missile test holding Tehran responsible for an attack on a Saudi warship by Houthi rebels in Yemen who the United States says are supported by Iran . Iran denies that but the remark was taken as a veiled warning about Iran ’s support of regional proxies like Hezbollah in Lebanon and Shiite militias in Iraq . “ The Trump administration condemns actions by Iran that undermine security prosperity and stability throughout the Middle East and place American lives at risk ” he said . Later President Trump posted on Twitter that “ Iran is rapidly taking over Iraq
" LONDON — The European Union is accustomed to crises . But it is probably safe to say that none of the 28 leaders who are gathering in Malta on Friday expected the crisis that has overtaken the agenda : the United States of America . Like much of the world the European Union is struggling to decipher a President Trump who seems every day to be picking a new fight with a new nation whether friend or foe . Hopes among European leaders that Mr. Trump ’s bombastic tone as a candidate would somehow smooth into a more temperate one as commander in chief are dissipating replaced by a mounting sense of anxiety and puzzlement over how to proceed . If many foreign leaders expected a Trump administration to push to renegotiate trade deals or take a tough line on immigration few anticipated that he would become an equal opportunity offender . He has insulted or humiliated Mexico Britain Germany and Iraq engaged in a war of words with China and Iran and turned a routine phone call with the prime minister of Australia a staunch ally into a minor diplomatic crisis . With the possible exception of NATO where he has softened his tone Mr. Trump has expressed disdain for other multilateral institutions such as the European Union . His praise has been reserved for populists and strongmen like Nigel Farage the former leader of the U. K. Independence Party President Rodrigo Duterte of the Philippines and of course President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia . Mr. Trump is convinced that the United States has been played for a patsy by the rest of the world and is vowing to set things straight . “ We ’re taken advantage of by every nation in the world virtually ” he said on Thursday at a prayer breakfast . “ It ’s not going to happen anymore . ” Against this forbidding backdrop some European leaders are urging their counterparts to recognize that Mr. Trump may represent a truly dire challenge one that threatens to upend not only the European project of integration and security
2.0"WASHINGTON — When President Trump told an audience of religious leaders on Thursday that he would ‘ destroy ’ the Johnson Amendment he declared his intention to sign a bill that would fundamentally alter a major aspect of the divide that has been a constant in American politics for generations . But what exactly is the Johnson Amendment ? It is one of the brightest lines in the legal separation between religion and politics . Under the provision which was made in 1954 entities like churches and charitable organizations are unable to directly or indirectly participate in any political campaign on behalf of or in opposition to any candidate . Specifically ministers are restricted from endorsing or opposing candidates from the pulpit . If they do they risk losing their status . Considered uncontroversial at the time it was passed by a Republican Congress and signed into law by President Dwight D. Eisenhower a Republican . Today however many Republicans want to repeal it . Back when Lyndon B. Johnson was a senator from Texas he introduced the measure as an amendment to the tax code in 1954 . Like many things Johnson did the goal was to bludgeon a political opponent in this case a rival in a primary who had the backing of nonprofit groups that were campaigning against him by suggesting he was a communist . Though there was no church involved according to PolitiFact churches were covered by the bill as well . Mr. Trump promised he would work to repeal the Johnson Amendment as part of his extensive outreach efforts to religious conservatives a group that took a long time to warm to his candidacy . Eliminating the measure has been a goal of the right . Conservatives have argued that it violates the protections of free speech and free exercise that the First Amendment extends to houses of worship . Courts have not agreed . Speaking of the implications of a repeal last year Jerry Falwell Jr . the prominent evangelical leader and Trump supporter
" WASHINGTON — Congress ’s rush to dismantle the Affordable Care Act once seemingly unstoppable is flagging badly as Republicans struggle to come up with a replacement and a key senator has declared that the effort is more a repair job than a demolition . “ It is more accurate to say ‘ repair Obamacare ’ ” Senator Lamar Alexander Republican of Tennessee and chairman of the Senate health committee said this week . “ We can repair the individual market and that is a good place to start . ” The struggles and false starts have injected more uncertainty into insurance markets that thrive on stability . An aspirational deadline of Jan. 27 for repeal legislation has come and gone . The powerful retirees ’ lobby AARP is mobilizing to defend key elements of the Affordable Care Act . Republican leaders who once saw a health law repeal as a quick first strike in the Trump era now must at least consider a worst case : unable to move forward with comprehensive health legislation even as the uncertainty that they helped foster rattles consumers and insurers . Insurers are threatening to exit the Affordable Care Act ’s market unless the Trump administration and Congress can quickly clarify their intentions : Will they support the existing public marketplaces encourage people to sign up and keep federal assistance flowing to insurers or not ? “ We need some certainty around the rules ” said Dr. J. Mario Molina chief executive of Molina Healthcare which has been a stalwart in the Affordable Care Act market and is making money under the system . “ We have a few months but we don ’t have a lot of time ” he said . With the official end on Tuesday of what was supposed to be its final open enrollment season the Affordable Care Act is looking more resilient than it seemed just a month ago . It will still be several days before final enrollment figures are released and although a surge of signups failed to have materialize amid talk of repeal early indications did not point to a collapse . At their annual retreat last week in Philadelphia several congressional Republicans edged away from their powerful promise to “ repeal and replace ” the Affordable Care Act . It would they said
" WASHINGTON — The White House on Thursday defended the planning and execution of a Special Operations raid in Yemen on Sunday — the first approved by President Trump since taking office — that left one American commando dead and three others injured and most likely killed several civilians including children . Sean M. Spicer President Trump ’s press secretary offered an unusually detailed chronology of the mission involving members of the Navy ’s SEAL Team 6 against the home of a senior Qaeda collaborator . He said it started with a plan submitted by the military ’s Central Command in November under the Obama administration and ended with Mr. Trump receiving updates in the White House on Saturday night as the mission unfolded eight time zones away . “ This was a very very and executed effort ” Mr. Spicer said . Mr. Trump has justified the risky attack on the heavily guarded house saying the commandos recovered valuable information including laptops and cellphones that could help thwart future terrorist attacks . Military officials said on Thursday that while that could prove to be true analysts were only just beginning to delve into the materials . Almost everything on the mission that could go wrong did . A Yemeni tribal sheikh said the Qaeda fighters were somehow tipped off to the troops ’ stealthy advance toward the village — perhaps by the whine of American drones that the tribal leader said were flying lower and louder than usual . The assault force which also included elite troops from the United Arab Emirates quickly found itself under intense fire from all sides — even from female combatants who unexpectedly took up weapons from assigned fighting positions — forcing the Americans to call in strikes from helicopter gunships and attack planes . A Pentagon spokesman Capt. Jeff Davis denied on Thursday that the mission had been compromised . On Wednesday Mr. Trump flew to Dover Air Force Base in Delaware to be present as the body of the American commando killed in the raid Chief Petty Officer William Owens was returned home . It was the first military death on the new commander in chief ’s watch . Mr. Spicer insisted on Thursday that the commandos had accomplished their mission even though “ it is tough to ever use the word ‘ success ’ when you know that somebody has lost their life . ” His explanation did not quell calls from human rights groups and at least one Democratic member of the House Armed Services Committee for an investigation into the mission and the allegations of civilian casualties . The Central Command said on Wednesday that civilian casualties were likely and that it was investigating . According to Al Qaeda ’s branch in Yemen the dead include the daughter of Anwar the Qaeda leader who was killed in a targeted drone strike in 2011 . Planning for the mission started months ago Mr. Spicer said . On Nov. 7
" For someone who promoted his management skills and campaigned as an “ organizational genius ” as Anderson Cooper of CNN put it it has been a rocky White House debut for Donald J. Trump the first president to go directly from the executive suite to the Oval Office . “ Chaos ” seems to be the word most often invoked closely followed by “ turmoil . ” ( One exception : the White House spokesman Sean Spicer who said he preferred “ . ” ) In less than two weeks Mr. Trump created upheaval at the nation ’s borders alienated longtime allies roiled markets with talk of a trade war and prompted some of the largest protests any president has faced . The conservative editorial page of The Wall Street Journal bemoaned a refugee policy “ so poorly explained and prepared for that it has produced confusion and fear at airports an immediate legal defeat and political fury at home and abroad . ” Even the top House Republican Speaker Paul D. Ryan who had released a statement praising the immigration order later distanced himself saying “ It ’s regrettable that there was some confusion with the rollout . ” All new presidents undergo a learning curve . But Mr. Trump promised a seamless transition and with a real chief executive in charge as opposed to a career politician an administration that would function as a machine . So it doesn ’t seem premature to ask some leading management experts for an assessment of Mr. Trump ’s first weeks purely from the viewpoint of organizational behavior and management effectiveness
" WASHINGTON — President Trump takes medication for three ailments including a drug to promote hair growth Mr. Trump ’s longtime physician Dr. Harold N. Bornstein said in a series of recent interviews . The other drugs are antibiotics to control rosacea a common skin problem and a statin for elevated blood cholesterol and lipids . Dr. Bornstein who spoke by telephone in four interviews over the past month also said that Mr. Trump takes a daily baby aspirin to reduce the risk of a heart attack . Over all he pronounced Mr. Trump healthy and his medical care “ as exactly up to date . ” Dr. Bornstein granted the interviews after The New York Times asked him to discuss his role in Mr. Trump ’s care and to clarify and expand on earlier statements he made about his patient ’s health during the presidential campaign . In recent decades The Times has interviewed presidents presidential candidates and their doctors about their health . At 70 Mr. Trump is the oldest person to become president . White House officials declined to comment on Wednesday night on the information provided by Dr. Bornstein and would not say whether he was still Mr. Trump ’s physician . The disclosure that Mr. Trump uses a drug to maintain growth of his scalp hair which has not been publicly known appears to solve a riddle of why Mr. Trump has a very low level of prostate specific antigen or PSA a marker for prostate cancer . Mr. Trump takes a small dose of the drug finasteride which lowers PSA levels . Finasteride is marketed as Propecia to treat baldness . Dr. Bornstein said he also took finasteride and credited it for helping maintain his own hair and Mr. Trump ’s hair . “ He has all his hair
" WASHINGTON — It was at a campaign rally in August that President Trump most fully unveiled the dark vision of an America under siege by “ radical Islam ” that is now radically reshaping the policies of the United States . On a stage lined with American flags in Youngstown Ohio Mr. Trump who months before had called for a “ total and complete shutdown ” of Muslim immigration argued that the United States faced a threat on par with the greatest evils of the 20th century . The Islamic State was brutalizing the Middle East and Muslim immigrants in the West were killing innocents at nightclubs offices and churches he said . Extreme measures were needed . “ The hateful ideology of radical Islam ” he told supporters must not be “ allowed to reside or spread within our own communities . ” Mr. Trump was echoing a strain of theorizing familiar to anyone who has been immersed in security and counterterrorism debates over the last 20 years . He has embraced a deeply suspicious view of Islam that several of his aides have promoted notably retired Lt. Gen. Michael T. Flynn now his national security adviser and Stephen K. Bannon the president ’s top strategist . This worldview borrows from the “ clash of civilizations ” thesis of the political scientist Samuel P. Huntington and combines straightforward warnings about extremist violence with critiques of Islam . It sometimes conflates terrorist groups like Al Qaeda and the Islamic State with largely nonviolent groups such as the Muslim Brotherhood and its offshoots and at times with the 1. 7 billion Muslims around the world . In its more extreme forms this view promotes conspiracies about government infiltration and the danger that Shariah the legal code of Islam may take over in the United States . Those espousing such views present Islam as an inherently hostile ideology whose adherents are enemies of Christianity and Judaism and seek to conquer nonbelievers either by violence or through a sort of stealthy brainwashing . The executive order on immigration that Mr. Trump signed on Friday might be viewed as the first major victory for this geopolitical school . And a second action
" BAGHDAD — The Trump administration amended its visa ban on Thursday to allow emigration by the families of Iraqi interpreters who served the United States government and military forces deployed in their country . The change recommended by the Pentagon eased some of the anger generated in Iraq by President Trump ’s executive order imposing the ban which has stoked anxiety and confusion around much of the world since it was issued last week . The order temporarily blocked all Syrian refugees from entering the United States and suspended visas for applicants from seven countries including Iraq . It applied to holders of Special Immigrant Visas issued to interpreters who worked for the United States during its occupation often at great personal risk and to their families . In a statement about the change sent to The New York Times a United States Embassy official in Baghdad said “ The U. S. government has determined that it is in the national interest to allow Iraqi Special Immigrant Visa ( S. I. V. ) holders to continue to travel to the United States . ” Iraqis who have received the visas the statement said may use them and the “ U. S. Embassy in Baghdad will continue to process and issue S. I. V.s to applicants who are otherwise qualified . ” For the family of a Iraqi who once worked as an interpreter for American forces the news was a joyous surprise after nearly a week of upended travel plans . An embassy official called to inform family members that they were again permitted to fly to the United States . “ I ’m shocked all over again ” said the former interpreter who asked to be identified only by his first name and an initial Munther A. to protect relatives in Iraq . The travel ban has thrown the lives of many former interpreters in Iraq into turmoil . Even with valid visas in hand some were refused entry at American airports and others were removed from planes scheduled to fly to the United States . There was also confusion because the executive order at least initially barred entry to Iraqis who held American green cards . Many of them but not all were eventually permitted to enter the United States . The Pentagon recommended that the White House exempt from the travel ban Special Immigrant Visa holders and others who had demonstrated their commitment to American military forces . Munther A. and his family were removed from a Turkish Airlines flight in Istanbul on Saturday just as they had settled into their seats for a scheduled flight to Kennedy Airport . They were forced to fly back to Baghdad
" Republicans on Thursday took one of their first steps to officially dismantle environmental regulations by easing restrictions on coal mining bolstering an industry that President Trump has made a symbol of America ’s neglected heartland . Using an obscure law that allows Congress to review regulations before they take effect the Senate voted to reverse the Stream Protection Rule which seeks to protect the nation ’s waterways from debris generated by a practice called surface mining . The Interior Department had said the rule would protect 6000 miles of streams and 52000 acres of forests by keeping coal mining debris away from nearby waters . The Senate vote was 54 to 45 following a House vote for repeal on Wednesday . “ Make no mistake about it this Obama administration rule is not designed to protect streams ” Representative Bill Johnson a Republican from Ohio who sponsored the move to reverse the rule said on Wednesday . “ Instead it was an effort to regulate the coal mining industry right out of business . ” The Senate also moved to reverse a separate rule requiring publicly traded oil gas and mineral companies to disclose payments to foreign governments for licenses or permits . The disclosure rule was aimed at curbing bribery and at helping developing countries hold companies and their governments accountable . After a procedural vote on Thursday final Senate action to cancel the rule is expected Friday with Mr. Trump ’s signature to follow . The Trump administration which has vowed to peel back regulations is particularly close to the fossil fuel industry . On Wednesday the Senate confirmed President Trump ’s pick for secretary of state Rex W. Tillerson

" Good morning . ( Want to get California Today by email ? Here ’s the . ) Let ’s turn it over to Thomas Fuller our San Francisco bureau chief for today ’s introduction . More than four decades ago California passed a landmark law protecting the state ’s farmworkers from abuse and helping them to organize . But the recent resignation of the head of a board that oversees the implementation of the law highlights the extent to which organized labor among farmworkers has collapsed since the days of the pioneering labor leader Cesar Chavez . Chavez ’s activism was instrumental in the creation of the Agricultural Labor Relations Act in 1975 the passage of which Gov. Jerry Brown described as a major accomplishment of his first stint as governor . In his recent resignation letter the head of the board William B. Gould IV described the law as “ irrelevant to farmworkers . ” He estimated that less than one percent of the agricultural work force is now represented by a union . As chairman of the Agricultural Labor Relations Board Mr. Gould was charged with overseeing the certification process of union elections . Yet Mr. Gould said virtually no workers came to the board during his tenure . “ During the entire three years that I was chairman of the board there was only one petition for representation filed by a union in the state of California ” he said . Mr. Gould says a major factor for the decline of organized farm labor is the fear that undocumented workers have of dealing with the government . Around half of the Californian agricultural work force is in the country illegally . “ There is not only no incentive to complain but there is no incentive to become involved with government in any way ” Mr. Gould said . California ’s agricultural industry is bigger than ever . It produces roughly a third of all fruits and vegetables grown in the United States and has about a third of the nation ’s farmworkers . Philip Martin a specialist on organized farm labor paints a less stark picture than Mr. Gould of the plight of farmworkers . Farmworker wages “ have gone up significantly ” Mr. Martin said and some workers have the benefit of voluntary agreements that growers sometimes enter with their suppliers . The average hourly wage of farmworkers in California is around $ 12 he said above the state ’s current minimum wage of $ 10 . Mr. Martin a professor emeritus at the University of California Davis says estimates on unionization rates among farmworkers in California are not very reliable because there are no government requirements to report them . But he says it is undeniable that unionization rates have plummeted from the heyday of union power in the late 1970 s . “ There ’s not near the union activity that there used to be ” he said . Student groups at U. C. Berkeley had vowed to disrupt the scheduled appearance of a controversial speaker . And on Wednesday
" Back on the campaign trail Donald J. Trump argued that the United States faced a threat — radical Islamic terrorism — on par with fascism Nazism and communism . He declared to a cheering crowd in Youngstown Ohio that “ those who do not believe in our Constitution or who support bigotry and hatred will not be allowed into our country . ” Now that view is not the stuff of stump speeches . It ’s America ’s foreign policy . As the White House puts in place a sweeping immigration ban focused on countries one of the top investigative reporters at The New York Times Scott Shane has been seeking an answer to one big question .

" Snap the parent of Snapchat disclosed several important aspects of its business in its initial public offering document . The complete filing is here . Below are notable excerpts . Prospective investors will be drawn to how quickly Snap has grown its advertising business in roughly two years with the company showing a nearly sevenfold increase between 2015 and last year . The question is how long the can maintain anywhere close to that kind of growth . The company said in its prospectus that it views daily active users as a critical measure of engagement — a measure that is tracked closely by similar companies . ( Facebook on Wednesday reported that it had an average of 1. 23 billion daily active users in December . ) As does every company in this kind of filing Snap laid out a number of potential risks to its business . Among them is Britain ’s decision to leave the European Union what has come to be known as Brexit which could pose large problems for the company because it recently designated London as its international hub . Snap noted that other countries may choose to censor Snapchat . Moreover the company pointed out that many of Google ’s services which power a significant portion of Snap ’s computer services are restricted in China . So according to Snap it isn ’t clear “ if we will be able to enter the market in a manner acceptable to the Chinese government . ” The company was originally built for users to send photographs and messages to their friends . But the company ’s ambitions have grown to include user stories news and branded content . Evan Spiegel 26 one of Snap ’s two founders started the company while he was a student at Stanford . Mr. Spiegel who is the company ’s chief executive and serves on the board owns a stake in the company that was worth $ 3. 7 billion at the end of last year . His 2016 compensation package came to $ 2. 6 million and included $ 503 205 in base salary a $ 1 million bonus and $ 901 635 in other compensation that covered his $ 890
" LOS ANGELES — When Evan Spiegel and Bobby Murphy were undergraduates at Stanford University they made an unconventional observation about what makes a social network valuable . Thanks to the rise of Facebook most everyone believed that networks became exponentially more valuable by amassing more users . But Mr. Spiegel noticed that in real life even people with thousands of acquaintances spent most of their time with just a few friends whose value outweighed a large number of looser ties . So when Mr. Spiegel and Mr. Murphy created Snapchat in 2011 they inverted the social networking dynamic . Out of their Stanford dorm rooms they made Snapchat as an app that would send disappearing messages and photos in a way that more closely mimicked the dynamics of a real world conversation . That would increase the appeal of Snapchat as a service that people used with a small number of good friends they figured . While online identity previously emphasized everything anyone has ever done with Snapchat “ my identity is who I am right now ” Mr. Spiegel said in a 2015 video to describe the app . Mr. Spiegel 26 Snap ’s chief executive has since built a budding digital empire based on that initial unconventional insight — and has continued upending the tech industry with his different way of seeing the world often with a touch of ego . Rather than accept the norms of the social networking ecosystem he has stuck to atypical viewpoints on matters from mobile video to spectacles . And he has done all of this more than 350 miles away from Silicon Valley in the sunny climes of Venice Calif. where Snapchat is based . Mr. Spiegel ’s singular approach will soon be more publicly on display . This week Snapchat ’s parent company Snap is expected to reveal its public stock offering paperwork for the first time . The filing will show how Snap is doing as a business and whether that justifies a public valuation of $ 20 billion to $ 25 billion which the company has been reported to be seeking . It will also disclose Mr. Spiegel ’s ownership stake in Snap the public offering is set to vault Mr. Spiegel and Mr. Murphy who is now chief technology officer
" NAIROBI Kenya — Ismail Ali Ibrahim gave away everything he owned : his bed his sheets his shirts his pots his pans his plates even his house . He didn ’t care . He was going to America . But this week he remained 7000 miles away marooned with more than 100 other Somali refugees in a spartan transit center in central Nairobi that smelled of nervous sweat . Mr. Ibrahim and many of his displaced comrades had been waiting more than two decades to be resettled in the United States and were supposed to fly to America this week . But their hopes were crushed by President Trump ’s executive order to freeze the refugee flow into the United States for at least four months . More than 25000 refugees from Somalia one of the poorest hungriest countries on earth were in the pipeline to be resettled in the United States . Mr. Ibrahim was much closer than most — so close that with his ticket paperwork and bag all zipped up the thought of it made his voice quiver . He had waited 26 long years for this living in a sweltering
" Last summer former President Bill Clinton pledged that if Hillary Clinton won the presidential election he would avoid conflicts by stepping aside from many of his duties at the Clinton Foundation restricting foreign donations to the charity and spinning off certain programs . Now nearly three months after Mrs. Clinton ’s defeat the foundation is still grappling with its place in the era of President Trump . It faces some daunting challenges : a drop in during the campaign uncertainty about the scale of the former president ’s ambitions and questions about leadership including how long its president Donna E. Shalala will stay and whether Mrs. Clinton might rejoin the charity . Mr. Clinton in a letter to be released with the foundation ’s annual report this week went so far as to ask supporters for advice on its future . “ We seek both your input and your ideas ” he wrote noting that the organization would work to expand its impact . Ms. Shalala in an interview on Thursday acknowledged the difficulties . “ Last year was a tough year ” she said “ because people were beating on us with nonsense ” a reference to bruising political attacks claiming that donors were using the foundation to curry favor with the Clintons . Revenues were down for 2016 Ms. Shalala acknowledged
" YANGON Myanmar — The rights lawyer had devised a plan to replace Myanmar ’s Constitution with one that would strip the military of its extraordinary political powers . The lawyer U Ko Ni a top adviser to the governing National League for Democracy had recently been working on a new draft a colleague said and he hoped to promote his project at a conference this month . But when he returned to the Yangon airport on Sunday from a trip to Indonesia cradling his young grandson in his arms as he waited for a taxi a man drew a pistol and shot him in the head . The killing appears to have been a rare political assassination in Myanmar fueling rumors distrust and worry about the country ’s future . “ This bullet was not only for Ko Ni ” the colleague U Thein Than Oo a human rights lawyer in Mandalay Myanmar said by telephone . “ It was for the N. L. D. and the people who want to amend and replace the 2008 Constitution and support the peace process . ” The Myanmar police have said that the assailant detained shortly after the shooting was a professional hit man and they have arrested three other suspects in the attack including the man they say hired the killer . The police have not announced a motive for the killing . It is not clear whether Mr. Ko Ni could have succeeded in changing the Constitution
" A grand jury indicted Ronald Gasser Jr . on Thursday in the fatal shooting of the former N. F. L. player Joe McKnight handing down a murder charge . The charge is more severe than the one that Mr. Gasser had initially faced in December when critics complained that racial bias may have affected the investigation . If convicted Mr. Gasser 54 would face life in prison with no parole . The death of Mr. McKnight 28 a star running back at the University of Southern California who later played for the Jets and Kansas City Chiefs in the N. F. L. spurred several days of protests . Supporters and Mr. McKnight ’s former teammates were outraged after the police initially freed Mr. Gasser . Though the authorities said Mr. Gasser had admitted to the shooting on Dec. 1 he was not arrested and charged until four days later . Mr. Gasser was initially charged with manslaughter over what the authorities described as a “ road rage ” confrontation in Terrytown La . about five miles southeast of New Orleans . “ Subsequent to that arrest the Jefferson Parish Sheriff ’s Office and the Jefferson Parish District Attorney ’s Office continued working together in a collaborative effort to develop additional evidence regarding the case ” the district attorney ’s office said in a statement Thursday . “ Today ’s indictment comes as a result of that joint effort . ” Mr. Gasser ’s bond was also increased to $ 750 000 . The delayed arrest and lesser initial charge had angered critics who said that Mr. Gasser the owner of a telecommunications firm and a real estate business may have been afforded more leeway because he is white or that the authorities were less invested in swift justice for a black man ’s death . In a fiery response after the initial arrest Sheriff Newell Normand of Jefferson Parish defended the pace of the investigation saying the authorities needed time to build a better case in a state that has strong Stand Your Ground laws . Investigators conducted more than 160 interviews and spoke to Mr. Gasser for more than 12 hours Sheriff Normand said at a news conference in December . “ Justice has no time period
" Neal K. Katyal was for a time the top lawyer in the Obama administration . As acting solicitor general he represented the government before the Supreme Court . He is no conservative and says he is disappointed that the latest nominee to the court is from the White House of President Trump . Yet in the opinion pages of The New York Times on Tuesday Katyal made a forceful case for Trump ’s pick to the high court Judge Neil Gorsuch . Katyal called the nominee a man of principle who will uphold the rule of law and “ bring a sense of fairness and decency to the job and a temperament that suits the nation ’s highest court . ” The author says he knows this because he has seen Gorsuch in action both in court and through a federal rules committee on which they both serve . What Katyal did not mention — and the page did not disclose in his bio — is that he has cases pending before the Supreme Court . Katyal was identified as a former solicitor general a law professor at Georgetown University and a private litigator at the law firm Hogan Lovells . But in that last role he represents the giant drug manufacturer Squibb Indian tribes and numerous other clients with cases before the court . Some readers would have liked to know more about Katyal ’s background . Here ’s one email from Mithra Busler of Atlantic Highlands N. J. I took this concern to both page and to Katyal himself . Jim Dao the editor said the editors had not been aware of Katyal ’s cases before the court . Writers are required to disclose potential conflicts he said but the process got rushed in this case . “ Editors do try to ask writers directly ” he said . “ On tight deadlines — and the Katyal piece was done on tight deadline — the question doesn ’t always get asked . So I don ’t blame the writer or the editor in this case . ” When I reached out to Katyal he said he had not received such a disclosure request and had not had a conversation about potential conflicts . He also thought it was obvious to The Times that as a lawyer whose practice often brings him to the Supreme Court he would have a case before it . More critically Katyal said it is common for Supreme Court lawyers not to mention litigation they have pending before the court when writing an opinion piece about a nominee or speaking to a reporter . Here ’s his response to me in full : The problem is that the did not note that Katyal is among the elite lawyers who argue before the high court . Katyal
" Precipitous declines in print advertising rocked the newspaper industry last year . And while The New York Times Company recorded significant growth in subscriptions and promising increases in digital advertising it nevertheless has not avoided the inevitable . The company said on Thursday that its print advertising revenue in 2016 fell 16 percent driving a 9 percent drop in total advertising revenue . For the quarter print advertising revenue declined 20 percent . The story on the digital side was positive underscoring the diverging financial narratives for print and digital that have emerged at the company . Digital advertising revenue rose 6 percent last year to $ 209 million . The Times Company added 514000 net subscriptions for its news products during the year bringing its total to 1. 6 million . Buoyed by readers ’ intense interest in the presidential election the company added 276000 net subscriptions to its news products in the last three months of the year more additions than in 2013 and 2014 combined . Including print and crossword product subscriptions The New York Times now has more than three million total paid subscribers a milestone that aligns with the company ’s commitment to a revenue model that is less reliant on the advertising revenue derived from page views and clicks . As for many other legacy print companies trying to adapt to an increasingly digital world these have been challenging times for The New York Times . Last month The Times released an internal report that called for swift changes in the newsroom including more staff training a commitment to hiring journalists with skills and an elimination of duplicative layers of editing . That has left employees bracing for staff reductions that newsroom leaders said could be announced in the next several weeks . Despite positive developments on the digital side the overall financial results announced on Thursday are unlikely to assuage the tangible anxiety among journalists at The Times . Total revenue fell about 2 percent for the year to $ 1. 6 billion and 1 percent in the quarter to $ 440 million . Adjusted operating profit

" During her pregnancy she never drank alcohol or had a cigarette . But nearly every day Stacey then 24 smoked marijuana . With her fiancé ’s blessing she began taking a few puffs in her first trimester to quell morning sickness before going to work at a sandwich shop . When sciatica made it unbearable to stand during her shifts she discreetly vaped marijuana oil on her lunch break . “ I wouldn ’t necessarily say ‘ Go smoke a pound of pot when you ’re pregnant ’ ” said Stacey now a mother in Deltona Fla . who asked that her full name be withheld because marijuana is illegal in Florida . “ In moderation it ’s O. K. ” Many pregnant women particularly younger ones seem to agree a recent federal survey shows . As states legalize marijuana or its medical use expectant mothers are taking it up in increasing numbers — another example of the many ways in which acceptance of marijuana has outstripped scientific understanding of its effects on human health . Often pregnant women presume that cannabis has no consequences for developing infants . But preliminary research suggests otherwise : Marijuana ’s main psychoactive ingredient — tetrahydrocannabinol or THC — can cross the placenta to reach the fetus experts say potentially harming brain development cognition and birth weight . THC can also be present in breast milk . “ There is an increased perception of the safety of cannabis use
" HOUSTON — In the to Super Bowl LI on Sunday politics has permeated the N. F. L. ’s shield to an unusual degree with players owners and even the league ’s commissioner being asked about President Trump and his recent policy decisions . But in a news conference to discuss Sunday ’s halftime show Lady Gaga one of the most outspoken pop stars and a vocal critic of the president remained coy when asked if her performance would include any strong political statements . “ The only statements that I ’ll be making during the halftime show are the ones that I ’ve been consistently making throughout my career ” Lady Gaga said . “ I believe in a passion for inclusion . I believe in the spirit of equality and that the spirit of this country is one of love and compassion and kindness . My performance will uphold those philosophies . ” She also did not divulge any details about what songs she would perform what outfits she would wear or if the bee emoji that she recently posted in a comment on Instagram was an indication that Beyoncé would be involved in her performance . But she did suggest the show would be one for her legions of fans who represent the margins of society . “ That kid that couldn ’t get a seat at the cool kids ’ table and that kid that was kicked out of the house because his mom and dad didn ’t accept him for who he was ? ” Lady Gaga said . “ That kid is going to have the stage for 13 minutes . And I ’m excited to give it to them . ” She said the goal of the performance which will include an introduction featuring her fans and her friend and frequent collaborator Tony Bennett was to have a unifying message but she understood that was a hard goal to achieve . “ I don ’t know if I will succeed in unifying America ” Lady Gaga said . “ You ’ll have to ask America when it ’s over . ” Lady Gaga 30 who was born Stefani Germanotta has often seemed to seek out controversy including stunts like wearing a dress made out of meat to the MTV Video Music Awards in 2010 . She has embraced a persona as an outcast of sorts by labeling herself as Mother Monster and her fans as Little Monsters . But after criticizing Mr. Trump before the election she has remained mostly quiet about him on social media since . On Twitter
" The Super Bowl is a popular destination for commercials showcasing premium water candy and beer — but politics can make it a difficult forum . 84 Lumber a private supplier of building materials in Pennsylvania that is advertising during the game for the first time this year said it was forced to alter its plans for a commercial after Fox deemed its depiction of a mother and daughter confronting a border wall between the United States and Mexico which President Trump has pledged to build as “ too controversial . ” The ad slated to run before halftime during the network ’s broadcast of the game on Sunday will now showcase the pair on a journey but omit the wall . Instead the address of a website will appear on the screen giving viewers a chance to see how their story ends . “ I still can ’t even understand why it was censored ” Maggie Hardy Magerko 84 Lumber ’s president and owner said in an interview this week . “ In fact I ’m flabbergasted by that in today ’s day and age . It ’s not pornographic it ’s not immoral it ’s not racist . ” Advertisers pay millions of dollars for commercial space during the game but the network and the National Football League maintain the right to approve any ad . “ We review spots to ensure they do not violate our advertising policies ” a league spokesman Brian McCarthy
" “ I ’m not talking politics at all ” Tom Brady said in response to the first of several questions about predictably politics . Brady has been getting a lot of these beginning with Super Bowl week ’s Opening Night on Monday at Minute Maid Park in Houston . This is not your average Super Bowl week in America . The chaos in Washington bedlam at airports and protests across the country serve as an unsettling crowd noise to even the serene superstar quarterback for the New England Patriots . Brady is friends with President Trump . So are the Patriots ’ owner Robert Kraft and Coach Bill Belichick . No sports team has been more closely associated with a new president or perhaps any president at least since Richard Nixon very publicly adopted the Washington Redskins as his own and even called occasional plays for Coach George Allen . Like Trump the Patriots are a divisive juggernaut that tend to engender strong passions for and against . The team represents a kind of sporting ideal of Trump ’s promise to make “ America win so much you ’ll be bored of winning . ” New England which will appear in an N. F. L. ninth Super Bowl on Sunday is a team that wins so much that a lot of America has become yes bored of its winning . And no small number of fans are convinced that the Patriots ( like Trump ) achieve their victories through dubious means and wish they would just go away and get off their TVs forever . The three main architects of the team ’s success — Kraft Belichick and Brady — have taken pains to emphasize that their allegiance to Trump is based on friendship and loyalty nothing more . They play golf and attend weddings and call to congratulate one another on elections and Super Bowl wins those kinds of everyday things . They are quick to assert their bipartisan or apolitical bona fides . Kraft has been a supporter of many Democrats and Democratic causes over the years Belichick declared himself apolitical in response to queries last fall after Trump at a campaign rally in New Hampshire read aloud from an effusive note of congratulations that Belichick had sent him . Brady started getting questions about Trump last fall when a red “ Make America Great Again ” cap was spotted in his Gillette Stadium locker reportedly put there by Kraft . Brady at first gave sheepish responses suggesting that it would be cool to have a golf pal as president . ( “ There ’d be a putting green on the White House lawn
" A few weeks ago in reaction to something we had written about blackness and whiteness in recent movies my colleague Manohla Dargis and I received a note from a reader . “ Since when is everything about race ? ” he wanted to know . Perhaps it was a rhetorical question . A flippant — though by no means inaccurate — answer would have been 1619 . But a more constructive response might have been to recommend Raoul Peck ’s new documentary “ I Am Not Your Negro . ” Let me do so now for that reader ( if he ’s still interested ) and for everybody else too . Whatever you think about the past and future of what used to be called “ race relations ” — white supremacy and the resistance to it in plainer English — this movie will make you think again and may even change your mind . Though its principal figure the novelist playwright and essayist James Baldwin is a man who has been dead for nearly 30 years you would be to find a movie that speaks to the present moment with greater clarity and force insisting on uncomfortable truths and drawing stark lessons from the shadows of history . To call “ I Am Not Your Negro ” a movie about James Baldwin would be to understate Mr. Peck ’s achievement . It ’s more of a posthumous collaboration an uncanny and thrilling communion between the filmmaker — whose previous work includes both a documentary and a narrative feature about the Congolese leader Patrice Lumumba — and his subject . The narration ( read by Samuel L. Jackson ) is entirely drawn from Baldwin ’s work . Much of it comes from notes and letters written in the when Baldwin was somewhat reluctantly sketching out a book never to be completed about the lives and deaths of Medgar Evers Malcolm X and Martin Luther King Jr . Reflections on those men ( all of whom Baldwin knew well ) and their legacies are interspersed with passages from other books and essays notably “ The Devil Finds Work ” Baldwin ’s 1976 meditation on race Hollywood and the mythology of white innocence . His published and unpublished words — some of the most powerful and penetrating ever assembled on the tortured subject of American identity — accompany images from old talk shows and news reports from classic movies and from our own decidedly present . Baldwin could not have known about Ferguson and Black Lives Matter
" Yet another seismic shift is taking place in French fashion . Riccardo Tisci the creative director of Givenchy and the designer responsible for redefining the brand Audrey Hepburn built for the Kardashian era said on Thursday that he was leaving the brand after 12 years . A successor has not been announced . Bernard Arnault chief executive of LVMH Moët Hennessy Louis Vuitton the French conglomerate that owns Givenchy said in a statement “ The chapter Riccardo Tisci has written with the House of Givenchy represents an incredible vision to sustain its continuous success and I would like to warmly thank him for his core contribution . ” Designer moves have become so common of late they are starting to seem more than critical . ( A brief list of departures since 2015 include Raf Simons from Dior Hedi Slimane from Saint Laurent Alber Elbaz from Lanvin Alexander Wang from Balenciaga Consuelo Castiglioni from Marni and as of last Monday Clare Waight Keller from Chloé . ) But Mr. Tisci ’s amicable divorce from Givenchy rumors of which WWD reported on last month could have deeper repercussions . Mr. Tisci had after all not only transformed Givenchy into one of LVMH ’s most successful brands but was often held up as a model for the partnership between hot young designer and heritage house . That he was willing to end what appeared to be a happy marriage suggests that the old days of designers staying in place for decades ( Karl Lagerfeld has been at Chanel since 1983 ) may be finally
" Look ! Up on the screen ! It ’s a mystery ! It ’s a sitcom ! Oh and it ’s a superhero show ! As the titans Marvel and DC having already colonized movie theaters take over ever larger chunks of television and streaming video they ’ve wisely started to mix things up . A new series set in one of their superhero universes just might be capeless or bring in costumed crime fighters as window dressing . Marvel ’s “ Jessica Jones ” on Netflix largely takes the form of a noirish mystery while its “ Legion ” on FX ( beginning next week ) looks like a surrealist psychological thriller . “ Powers ” on the PlayStation Network is essentially “ Law Order : Superhumans . ” Perhaps the least superheroish superhero show though is NBC ’s new “ Powerless ” ( beginning Thursday ) . It ’s a comedy for one thing part of a small tradition that includes “ The Tick ” and the campy 1960 s “ Batman . ” ( A promo for the show is narrated by that Batman Adam West . ) And it ’s set in a particularly nonheroic corner of the DC universe : the drab offices of Wayne Security where a cousin of Batman oversees a motley crew designing products that keep civilians from becoming collateral damage in superhero battles . It ’s a nifty layered premise . For one thing it ’s a dig at the big soulless tentpole movies in which teams of heroes lay waste to cities full of screaming little humans particularly the “ Avengers ” films from DC ’s rival Marvel . Seen from another angle — as a traditional workplace sitcom — the angle works just as well . What office doesn ’t make people feel powerless ? It ’s hard to judge how that premise will be developed though
" In cities the world over men ( and to a lesser extent women ) who urinate in the street — al fresco — are a scourge of urban life costing millions of dollars for cleaning and the repair of damage to public infrastructure . And oh the stench . Now Paris has a new weapon against what the French call “ les pipis sauvages ” or “ wild peeing ” : a sleek and public toilet . Befitting the country of Matisse the urinal looks more like a modernist flower box than a receptacle for human waste . You can even grow flowers in its compost . The Parisian innovation was spurred by a problem of public urination so endemic that City Hall recently proposed dispatching a nearly “ incivility brigade ” of officers to try to prevent bad behavior which also includes leaving dog waste on the street and littering cigarette butts . Fines for public urination are steep — about $ 75 . Even that was not deterrent enough officials say . A small brigade of sanitation workers still has to scrub about 1800 miles of sidewalk each day . And dozens of surfaces are splattered by urine according to City Hall . Enter the boxy Uritrottoir — a combination of the French words for “ urinal ” and “ pavement ” — which has grabbed headlines and has already been lauded as a “ friend of flowers ” by Le Figaro the French newspaper because it produces compost that can be used for fertilizer . Designed by Faltazi a industrial design firm its top section also doubles as an attractive flower or plant holder . The Uritrottoir which has paint and does not use water works by storing urine on a bed of dry straw sawdust or wood chips . Monitored remotely by a “ urine attendant ” who can see on a computer when the toilet is full the urine and straw is carted away to the outskirts of Paris
" PEARL RIVER DELTA China — As Wong stands on the deck of the traditional Chinese wooden junk he is building in Shenwan a cluster of fish ponds and factories in the Pearl River Delta of southern China he shouts to be heard over the shriek of metalwork from steel ships that are being worked on nearby . “ It ’s like a piece of art ” said Mr. Wong a bronzed with stony hands and a quick grin describing what he loves about the boats with the batwing sails that he so rarely gets to build . A native of the delta region Mr. Wong in 1982 swam for two hours from nearby Zhuhai on China ’s mainland to what was then the Portuguese colony of Macau to escape China ’s strict Communist government . Once there he set up an early incarnation of Yi Hap Shipyard a builder of wooden junks which symbolize the delta and the maritime culture that drove China ’s early growth . “ Not many people are wooden junks anymore ” Mr. Wong said . “ I wish more people would . ” Within the next few months the junk the Dai Cheung Po — also known as the Aqua Luna II — will unfurl its sails above its high stern and low bow and join its smaller sister the Cheung Po Tsai or the Aqua Luna I already in Victoria Harbor in Hong Kong to offer parties and dinners . It is one of a few of these traditional ships with sails being made by one of the last remaining junk builders in China . “ The building tradition is more or less moribund ” said Stephen Davies
" The bodies just keep arriving . On Thursday only two days into February the coroner ’s office in Dayton Ohio had already handled 25 deaths — 18 caused by drug overdoses . In January the office processed 145 cases in which the victims ’ bodies had been destroyed by opioids . Now the Montgomery County Coroner ’s Office is so crammed with corpses that it has asked a local funeral parlor to take in four bodies for “ temporary storage ” the first time it has had to make such a request Kenneth M. Betz director of the coroner ’s office said on Thursday . “ We ’re running at full capacity ” he said in a phone interview . “ We ’ve never experienced this volume of accidental drug overdoses in our history . We now call funeral homes immediately ” to ask if there is space available he added . Widespread abuse of powerful opioid pain relievers in the United States — including oxycodone hydrocodone hydromorphone and fentanyl heroin ’s cheaper but deadlier cousin — has driven overdose death rates to historic highs according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention . The C. D. C. ’s numbers show that 91 people in the United States die every day from opioid overdose . The number of bodies from accidental overdoses that have come to the Montgomery County Coroner ’s Office in the first 33 days of the year — 163 — is already more than half the yearly totals for the past two years . In 2015 the total was 259 last year the number of deaths from January to September was 253 figures from the office show . In Ohio
" LOS ANGELES — Now it ’s war : Nickelodeon once again winning the children ’s ratings race against Disney Channel has decided to throw its weight behind . .. a princess . Nickelodeon has always had its share of magical kingdoms but this cable network has tended to leave the princess business to Disney . ( And what a business it is generating an estimated $ 5. 5 billion a year in merchandise revenue alone . ) But here comes “ Nella the Princess Knight ” which Nickelodeon will introduce on Monday in a programming block for preschoolers . The Princess Police mostly academics who use Snow White Sleeping Beauty and their slender ilk to make points about their negative impact on young girls have been a perennial thorn in Disney ’s side even as the company has introduced black and Latina royals along with a preschool one “ Sofia the First . ” Will Nickelodeon now find itself in a similar position ? Maybe not . The Nella pushes boundaries at least for television aimed at in the areas of race and gender . She is biracial with a black father and a white mother a decision informed by Nickelodeon research indicating that most children under 12 will be nonwhite by 2020 and that already 17 percent are biracial . The character also mashes together traditional boy and girl gender norms . Nella may ride a unicorn with a pink mane ( à la My Little Pony ) but she does it while brandishing a sword and wearing knight gear a bit like a preschool version of Brienne of Tarth from “ Game of Thrones . ” She is a girlie girl but does traditional boy activities ( battling a dragon ) and does not spend the majority of her time in a ball gown . Nickelodeon ’s princess may strike some adults as subversive particularly given the surge of conservatism that helped push Donald J. Trump into office . But children see families and the blurring of gender lines as normal said Cyma Zarghami Nickelodeon ’s longtime chief . “ Adults might say ‘ Oh look — she ’s biracial

Min Jin Lee ’s stunning novel “ Pachinko ” — her second after “ Free Food for Millionaires ” ( 2007 ) — announces its ambitions right from the opening sentence : “ History has failed us but no matter . ” “ Pachinko ” chronicles four generations of an ethnic Korean family first in Korea in the early 20th century then in Japan itself from the years before World War II to the late 1980 s . The novel opens with an arranged marriage in Yeongdo a fishing village at the southern tip of Korea . That union produces a daughter Sunja who falls in love at 16 with a prominent ( and married ) mobster . After Sunja becomes pregnant a local pastor offers her a chance to escape by marrying him and immigrating together to his brother ’s house in an ethnic Korean neighborhood in Osaka . Together they embark into the fraught unknown . Pachinko the game ubiquitous throughout Japan unifies the central concerns of identity homeland and belonging . For the ethnic Korean population in Japan discriminated against and shut out of traditional occupations pachinko parlors are the primary mode of finding work and accumulating wealth . Called Zainichi or foreign residents ethnic Koreans are required to reapply for alien registration cards every three years even if they were born in Japan and are rarely granted passports making overseas travel nearly impossible . From a young age Sunja ’s oldest son sees being Korean as “ a dark heavy rock ” his greatest
" If we lived in normal political times our new president would be enjoying his honeymoon period those few blissful weeks of good will and high hopes that usually accompany the start of an administration . Instead the election of Donald J. Trump to the nation ’s highest office has provoked an opposition movement that is extraordinary in American history with millions of people devoted to stopping whatever it is he might want to do . The declarations began early on with one key word echoing across them . “ We are going to resist we are going to oppose ” the filmmaker Michael Moore announced on the Friday after Trump ’s election . “ This is going to be a massive resistance . ” The following week the former MSNBC host Keith Olbermann began a new video series titled “ The Resistance . ” In December a group of former Democratic congressional staff members published a pamphlet titled “ Indivisible : A Practical Guide for Resisting the Trump Agenda ” calling on liberals and leftists to emulate the most effective tactics of the Tea Party . On Twitter hashtags like #ResistTrump #NewAmericanResistance and #TheResistance document the range of concerns and movements now assembling under one banner : climate change net neutrality Black Lives Matter reproductive and immigrant and disability rights . The Women ’s March made all of this spectacularly visible with a show of defiance intended to put the president on notice . “ Today is not a concert ” the march organizer Tamika Mallory told the crowd gathered in Washington . “ It is not a parade . And it is not a party . Today is an act of resistance . ” Days later activists unfurled a banner from a crane behind the White House with just one word printed on it : RESIST . As the term of choice for the emerging coalition “ resistance ” signals urgency
2.0"A federal judge in Seattle on Friday temporarily blocked President Trump ’s immigration order from being enforced nationwide reopening America ’s door to visa holders from seven predominantly Muslim countries and dealing the administration a humbling defeat . The White House vowed late Friday to fight what it called an “ outrageous ” ruling saying it would seek an emergency halt to the judge ’s order as soon as possible and restore the president ’s “ lawful and appropriate order . ” “ The president ’s order is intended to protect the homeland and he has the constitutional authority and responsibility to protect the American people ” the White House said . A revised statement released later omitted the word “ outrageous . ” And early Saturday morning Mr. Trump tweeted in defense of his stand . Courts around the country have halted aspects of Mr. Trump ’s temporary ban on travel from the seven countries but the Seattle ruling was the most to date . Airlines that had been stopping travelers from boarding planes to the United States were told by the government in a conference call Friday night to begin allowing them to fly according to a person familiar with the call but who declined to be identified because it was a private discussion . The Trump administration however could again block the travelers if it were to win an emergency stay . The federal government was “ arguing that we have to protect the U. S. from individuals from these countries and there ’s no support for that ” said the judge James Robart of Federal District Court for the Western District of Washington an appointee of President George W. Bush in a decision delivered from the bench . The judge ’s ruling was temporary putting Mr. Trump ’s policy on hold at least until the government and opponents of the order had a chance to make full arguments or until the administration won a stay . “ What we ’re seeing here is the courts standing up to the unconstitutional ban that President Trump imposed ” said Omar Jadwat director of the Immigrants ’ Rights Project at the A. C. L. U. “ There ’s obviously more litigation to come but this is truly good news for the many people both in this country and abroad who have been unfairly targeted on the basis of their religion by this ban . ” It is not unusual for district courts to issue nationwide injunctions blocking executive actions
" Just minutes after a federal judge blocked part of President Trump ’s immigration order on Saturday night ruling that no one with a valid visa should be deported someone was according to court papers filed on Thursday . Her name is Suha Amin Abdullah Abushamma a Sudanese doctor with a valid visa who was working at the Cleveland Clinic in Ohio in a residency program . “ She left for vacation thinking she ’d be gone for a short time and then she couldn ’t come back to her home ” Dr. Abushamma ’s lawyer Jennifer Kroman said on Thursday evening . “ It raises not only constitutional questions but questions about the importance of court orders . ” Mr. Trump said his immigration order restricting entry to the United States by people from seven predominantly Muslim countries including Sudan was intended to make the country safe from Islamic terrorists . But according to lawyers for immigrants who were barred the order caught in its web dozens of people like Dr. Abushamma who graduated at the top of her class from medical school . Dr. Abushamma ’s case was highlighted at a hearing in Federal District Court in Brooklyn on Thursday where Judge Carol B. Amon extended until Feb. 21 the initial ruling — formally known as a stay of removal — issued last week by her colleague Judge Ann M. Donnelly . Judge Amon will be presiding over the case and deciding on the legal issues underlying the executive order while at the same time overseeing nine cases in which plaintiffs say they were improperly deported . The Thursday hearing before Judge Amon was largely procedural and was held to set out the schedule for arguments and motions in coming weeks . But in a separate action the day before Judge Amon ordered the government to explain in writing by why she should not allow Dr. Abushamma to return to the United States
2.0"Vincent Viola a billionaire Wall Street trader and President Trump ’s nominee for secretary of the Army abruptly withdrew his name for the post on Friday night after concluding it would be too difficult to untangle himself from his business ties two government officials said . Mr. Viola is an owner of the Florida Panthers hockey club and a majority shareholder in Virtu Financial and Eastern Air Lines among a number of other business interests . This week The New York Times reported that Mr. Viola had been negotiating to swap his stake in Eastern Air Lines for a stake in Swift Air an airline with government subcontracts . If his nomination had continued he would have faced certain scrutiny for potentially becoming a government official who benefits from federal contracts . The Trump administration did not announce his withdrawal which was reported earlier on Friday by Bloomberg News but a senior administration official and a Pentagon official separately confirmed his decision which the White House accepted Friday . Both officials spoke on the condition of anonymity . Mr. Viola is a 1977 graduate of the United States Military Academy at West Point and he last served in the Army Reserves at the rank of major . He remained connected to the military through donations to West Point including to the academy ’s Combating Terrorism Center . A former Pentagon official and close friend said Mr. Viola was devastated over having to withdraw from what he described as a lifelong dream job . But the former official said Mr. Viola felt he was unable to sell his interest in some of his holdings because doing so could have destroyed those companies . His decision followed weeks of negotiations between his lawyers and the government as they sought to find a solution . Ultimately they could not . Mr. Viola has a net worth of almost $ 1. 8 billion and is a of Virtu . Virtu had planned to go public in 2014 but pulled the plug on the move because of choppy markets and lingering questions around how trading firms like Virtu make money . In a regulatory filing at the time Virtu said regulators were looking into its trading practices . It is not known if this issue played a role in Mr. Viola ’s decision to withdraw his name for the Army secretary job which is a post that requires Senate confirmation . His decision to withdraw comes the same week another of Mr. Trump ’s appointees Anthony Scaramucci was told he would not get a top job at the White House amid concerns about the recent sale of his company to a large Chinese conglomerate . In an episode unrelated to the finances of Mr. Viola it was recently revealed that he was involved in an altercation in August : He was accused of punching a concessions worker at a racehorse auction in Saratoga Springs
" President Trump on Friday moved to chisel away at the Obama administration ’s legacy on financial regulation announcing steps to revisit the rules enacted after the 2008 financial crisis and to back away from a measure intended to protect consumers from bad investment advice . After a White House meeting with executives from Wall Street Mr. Trump signed a directive aimed at the Act crafted by the Obama administration and passed by Congress in response to the 2008 meltdown . He also signed a memorandum that paves the way for reversing a policy known as the fiduciary rule that requires brokers to act in a client ’s best interest rather than seek the highest profits for themselves when providing retirement advice . The executive order affecting is vague in its wording and expansive in its reach . It never mentions the law by name instead laying out “ core principles ” for regulations that include empowering American investors and enhancing the competitiveness of American companies . Even so it gives the Treasury the authority to restructure major provisions of and it directs the Treasury secretary to make sure existing laws align with administration goals . Mr. Trump ’s action on the fiduciary rule which Democrats and consumer groups immediately denounced as a gift to Wall Street could have a more concrete impact . His memorandum directs the Labor Department to review whether the rule may “ adversely affect ” investors ’ ability to access financial advice — and if it does it authorizes the agency to rescind and revise the rule . Supporters of the rule describe it as a basic consumer protection to prevent brokers from taking advantage of vulnerable clients . The industry argues that the rule will expose it to a torrent of lawsuits and will increase costs that firms will pass on to consumers . Taken together Mr. Trump ’s actions on Friday constitute an extensive effort to loosen regulations on banks and other major financial companies even though the president campaigned as a champion of working Americans and as a critic of Wall Street elites . Mr. Trump said on Friday that his actions were intended to help both Wall Street and workers as his administration eases constraints on banks and allows them to lend more to companies which could then hire more workers . “ We expect to be cutting a lot out of because frankly I have so many people friends of mine that had nice businesses they can ’t borrow money ” Mr. Trump said in the State Dining Room during his meeting with business leaders . “ They just can ’t get any money because the banks just won ’t let them borrow it because of the rules and regulations in . ” The 2010 act reined in mortgage practices and derivatives trading and curbed the ability of banks to trade with their own money in a measure known as the Volcker Rule . Despite the president ’s concerns banks have increased their consumer lending like credit cards and auto loans
" WASHINGTON — New sanctions that the Trump administration imposed on Friday to punish Tehran ’s latest ballistic missile test marked the beginning of what officials called the end of an era in which the United States was “ too tolerant of Iran ’s bad behavior . ” In what was described as the first in a series of efforts to confront Iran around the globe the ban on banking transfers was levied against 25 Iranians and companies that officials said assisted in Tehran ’s ballistic missile program and support of terrorist groups . The immediate trigger for the sanctions which drew from a list of targets drawn up last year by the Obama administration was Iran ’s missile test last Sunday . The exact details of the test remain shrouded in considerable mystery . But the way the two countries jabbed at each other — with the White House saying it would “ no longer tolerate Iran ’s provocations that threaten our interests ” and Iranian state news media vowing retaliation — had distinct echoes of the darkest days before the July 2015 nuclear accord was reached . In striking that deal 19 months ago the Obama administration was gambling that over time Washington and Tehran would learn how to manage their differences and cooperate on one or two discrete projects starting with eliminating the Islamic State . But that era never arrived . And with the announcements on Friday it became clearer than ever that leaders in both countries now see an advantage in taking a hard line — each betting that the other does not have the stomach for a risky expensive confrontation . “ The danger is that this is the first stage in an escalation that could culminate in a military confrontation between Iran and the United States or Iran and Israel ” said Karim Sadjadpour of the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace . “ The entire eight years of the Obama administration was an example of unprecedented but largely unreciprocated overtures for cooperation with Iran in the Middle East . The Iranians weren ’t interested . And now the Iranians sense the rest of the world would not line up with the Trump administration . ” The sanctions themselves are unlikely to have a significant effect on Iranian action . They strike at specific companies and arms traders from Iran to Lebanon and China . Mr. Obama took similar steps a year ago after another Iranian missile test . But by and large his administration tried to tensions — and at one point even assured European banks that under the nuclear deal they were free to resume transactions with Iran without fear of American retaliation . In announcing the new sanctions the White House made clear that it planned to call out every violation and respond . The Treasury Department took the unusual step of describing the inner workings of three networks that produce technology for Iran around the globe in an effort to expose front companies and signal a new level of pressure on Tehran . “ The international community has been too tolerant of Iran ’s bad behavior
2.0"■ President Trump responded to the failed attack in Paris with his trademark understatement . Europe is not amused . ■ The “ Bowling Green massacre ” that Kellyanne Conway lamented never happened but it has triggered another battle . ■ The president ’s phone manners apparently have not changed . This time he used them on Uber ’s chief executive . A soldier shot and wounded a man wielding a machete near the Louvre museum in Paris prompting French authorities to open a terrorism investigation . The president of the United States responded : It is difficult to divine Mr. Trump ’s thinking at times but safe to say “ get smart ” in this case most likely means accepting his policies . For their part Europeans aren ’t taking well to the new American president . President François Hollande of France in a defense of the European Union that Mr. Trump has disparaged said on Friday that European countries that wanted to forge bilateral ties with the United States had to “ understand that there is no future with Trump if it is not defined in common . ” Then there are the Germans : When Kellyanne Conway the White House senior adviser cited the “ Bowling Green massacre ” to justify President Trump ’s halt to visas from seven predominantly Muslim countries America was left scratching its collective head . And social media lit up with delight over the “ massacre ” that time forgot . This has not sat well with Ms. Conway who after all did have a small kernel of truth to back her up though no killings happened in Bowling Green Ky . and a “ massacre ” does not appear to have ever occurred anywhere . In 2013 the State Department imposed a freeze on processing Iraqi refugees after two Qaeda members were discovered in Iraq setting roadside bombs targeting American troops . They had been admitted to the United States in 2009 and lived in Bowling Green before they returned to Iraq . The fingerprint that nailed them was on a cellphone detonator tied to a bomb that had not exploded . So “ massacre ” ? No. In Bowling Green ? No. Refugees ? Well yes sort of . Ms. Conway now says she misspoke . But things got really hot when a Clinton jumped into the fray — Chelsea Clinton . Which only stoked old campaign feuds and a reminder of the exaggerated claim from Hillary Clinton that as first lady she once landed in Bosnia under fire from hostile Serbs . It never ends . President Trump has taken some heat for his phone manners since it emerged that he pretty much chewed out Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull of Australia before hanging up on him . Apparently Mr. Trump is unrepentant . According to the new online newsletter Axios
" WASHINGTON — The two most influential social liberals in President Trump ’s inner circle — daughter Ivanka and Jared Kushner — helped kill a proposed executive order that would have scrapped L. G. B. T. protections according to people familiar with the issue . A third Gary D. Cohn the chairman of the president ’s National Economic Council a Democrat who was brought to the West Wing by Mr. Kushner and reflects the socially liberal and economically conservative views of many Wall Street power brokers privately told aides to the president that he was disturbed it was even being considered . The executive order has exposed what is likely to be a persistent schism in Mr. Trump ’s paradoxical presidency : He is a cosmopolitan New Yorker who has long operated in an environment where sexual orientation is often an afterthought but is nonetheless beholden to the social conservatives who backed him overwhelmingly in 2016 despite reports of his crudeness and sexual misdeeds . Mr. Kushner a lifelong Democrat and Ms. Trump an independent travel in liberal social circles and have long supported L. G. B. T. rights . Neither had seen the order before details were leaked . They expressed their dissatisfaction to Mr. Trump ’s other advisers and then weighed in directly with the president who opposes marriage but has spoken out against discrimination . On Monday night reports had swirled that Mr. Trump would sign some version of the rollback as a concession to social conservatives ahead of the president ’s announcement of a United States Supreme Court nominee . As a result White House officials pushed out a statement asserting that Mr. Trump “ is determined to protect the rights of all Americans including the L. G. B. T. Q. community ” adding that the president “ continues to be respectful and supportive of L. G. B. T. Q. rights just as he was throughout the election . ” The draft order circulated by religious conservatives allied with Mr. Trump and Vice President Mike Pence was one of about 250 edicts that have been sent to federal agencies for vetting . Mr. Trump never seriously considered signing the order
2.0"Decades before President Trump nominated him to be labor secretary Andrew Puzder went to battle with federal labor regulators in a Las Vegas courtroom . The year was 1983 and Mr. Puzder was working at a law firm owned by a famous mob lawyer and casino owner whom the Labor Department accused of squandering $ 25 million from his union workers ’ pension funds on sham investments . It fell to Mr. Puzder to lead the defense which he framed in aggressively antigovernment terms . In his opening statement Mr. Puzder told the jury it was not his boss ’s fault for not paying back the money — it was overzealous regulators in Washington who had killed off a good business deal by intervening before his investments could succeed he said . “ We should not be required to pay for the mistakes of the Department of Labor ” and the union Mr. Puzder said according to The Las Vegas . The jury did not buy it . Mr. Puzder ’s boss Morris A. Shenker was hit with a $ 34 million judgment and filed for bankruptcy . More than three decades later the lawyers who represented the Labor Department in the case recall Mr. Puzder as bright and capable but they still marvel that he blamed government regulators . “ I personally find there is some irony in him being nominated to be the secretary of labor ” said Daly D. E. Temchine the lead lawyer in the case for the Department of Labor . “ Back then he represented a guy who thought it was O. K. to screw his employees . ” As it turned out Mr. Puzder ’s arguments in the case foreshadowed positions he would take after leaving the practice of law to become chief executive of a company . He has repeatedly argued that labor regulations stifle economic growth . He has indicated his preference for machines over people because they do not take time off or file lawsuits . And a recording recently surfaced of him referring to his employees as “ the best of the worst . ” Because he was a lawyer representing a client the positions that Mr. Puzder took in the case do not necessarily represent his personal views . But Mr. Shenker was more than just a client : He was also Mr. Puzder ’s first boss one he chose to work for an associate said
" TOKYO — Defense Secretary Jim Mattis assured Japan ’s prime minister on Friday that the United States would stand by its mutual defense treaty with the country despite statements by President Trump during last year ’s campaign that suggested he might pull back from American security commitments in Asia . “ I want there to be no misunderstanding during the transition in Washington that we stand firmly 100 percent shoulder to shoulder with you and the Japanese people ” Mr. Mattis said at the start of a meeting with Prime Minister Shinzo Abe . Mr. Trump when he was running for president had complained that the defense treaty was even suggesting that the United States should threaten to withdraw from it unless Japan did more to compensate Washington for helping to defend its territory . “ You always have to be prepared to walk ” Mr. Trump said in August . “ I don ’t think it ’s going to be necessary . It could be though . ” With North Korea threatening to test an intercontinental ballistic missile and China claiming sovereignty over nearly all of the South China Sea the Trump administration is now emphasizing its “ ironclad ” commitment to the security of Japan and South Korea . Still Mr. Trump ’s conflicting signals and his transactional approach to diplomacy have made allies nervous . So even as the president shakes up Washington Mr. Mattis has scored points in Asia by emphasizing that the United States ’ relationship with its allies has not fundamentally changed . In Japan that included assurances about Article 5 of the treaty which commits the United States to helping defend territory that Japan administers should it be attacked . “ Due to some of the provocations out of North Korea and other challenges that we jointly face I want to make certain that Article 5 of our mutual defense treaty is understood to be as real to us today as it was a year ago five years ago and as it will be a year and 10 years from now ” Mr. Mattis told Mr. Abe . Japan hosts about 50000 American troops on bases throughout the country and it relies on the American nuclear umbrella . Given that the alliance has lasted since the end of World War II analysts said it was somewhat surprising that it would be necessary to reassure Japan that it remained solid . “ It ’s sad that we ’ve even come to this point

" In the waning days of this year ’s Affordable Care Act period the Trump administration declared war on the health law releasing an executive order that could weaken its requirements and yanking advertisements and outreach off the air . Those actions appear to have made a difference . for health plans in the states managed by the federal government are down slightly compared with last year . About 9. 2 million Americans picked an Obamacare marketplace plan for this year according to a government report released Friday . Last year that number was 9. 6 million . The decline by itself isn ’t that meaningful but several snapshots over previous months had shown that were on track to overtake last year ’s enrollment . It was only in the final two weeks of enrollment when there ’s typically a surge that the numbers dropped . Fewer than 400000 people signed up for Obamacare plans over the last two weeks . Last year more than 700000 people signed up in the last week alone . The falloff suggests that Trump administration actions may have confused consumers discouraged them from enrolling or simply made it easier to forget about the deadline . So far the numbers do not show that the markets are failing or in the “ death spiral ” that Mr. Trump and House Speaker Paul Ryan have often mentioned . But they show how important signaling is and how confused the signaling currently is . Mr. Trump ’s executive order signed on the day of his inauguration was widely reported as eliminating the law ’s requirement to buy insurance . ( I differ with that view . ) And the reductions in outreach may have prevented some people who intended to sign up from getting the reminder that they needed . More broadly promises from Mr. Trump and Republicans in Congress to quickly repeal Obamacare may have caused some people to think the law was no longer in effect at all . My colleagues Abby Goodnough and Robert Pear spoke with counselors around the country who said many of their customers assumed that Obamacare would be repealed soon . Premiums were substantially higher this year than last in many places and it ’s possible that those high prices also depressed . But most Obamacare customers do not pay full price for their plans so they do not feel the increases . Full national numbers won ’t be released until next month . The 9. 2 million reported Friday come only from states that use the federal government ’s website to select plans . appear to be up in a few states using their own system . Of course
" Robert O. Work the veteran defense official retained as deputy secretary by President Trump calls them his “ A. I. dudes . ” The breezy moniker belies their serious task : The dudes have been a kitchen cabinet of sorts and have advised Mr. Work as he has sought to reshape warfare by bringing artificial intelligence to the battlefield . Last spring he asked “ O. K. you guys are the smartest guys in A. I. right ? ” No the dudes told him “ the smartest guys are at Facebook and Google ” Mr. Work recalled in an interview . Now increasingly they ’re also in China . The United States no longer has a strategic monopoly on the technology which is widely seen as the key factor in the next generation of warfare . The Pentagon ’s plan to bring A. I. to the military is taking shape as Chinese researchers assert themselves in the nascent technology field . And that shift is reflected in surprising commercial advances in artificial intelligence among Chinese companies . Last year for example Microsoft researchers proclaimed that the company had created software capable of matching human skills in understanding speech . Although they boasted that they had outperformed their United States competitors a A. I. researcher who leads a Silicon Valley laboratory for the Chinese web services company Baidu gently taunted Microsoft noting that Baidu had achieved similar accuracy with the Chinese language two years earlier . That in a nutshell is the challenge the United States faces as it embarks on a new military strategy founded on the assumption of its continued superiority in technologies such as robotics and artificial intelligence . First announced last year by Ashton B. Carter President Barack Obama ’s defense secretary the “ Third Offset ” strategy provides a formula for maintaining a military advantage in the face of a renewed rivalry with China and Russia . Well into the 1960 s the United States held a military advantage based on technological leadership in nuclear weapons . In the 1970 s
" With the January jobs report released Friday by the Labor Department we know that President Trump took office amid a relatively low unemployment rate ( it ticked up to 4. 8 percent in January ) strong job growth ( 227 000 positions added that month ) and weak wage growth ( average hourly earnings up 0 . 1 percent in January and 2. 5 percent over the past year ) . There was even some welcome progress in the number of people who count themselves as part of the labor force . But Mr. Trump made amply clear in his campaign that he doesn ’t care for the way that government agencies and mainstream economists summarize the state of the job market . The unemployment rate he said in December is “ totally fiction . ” He claimed at one point during the campaign that the real jobless rate was not the number below 5 percent widely cited by economists but something like 42 percent . There is certainly a filament of truth in that . The unemployment rate counts only people who say they want a job and have looked for one in the last month — meaning that millions of Americans who dropped out of the labor force during the aftermath of the 2008 recession do not count as unemployed by the standard definition . But we have some exciting news for the president . The Bureau of Labor Statistics doesn ’t just issue the widely cited headline unemployment rate ( again 4. 8 percent in January ) . This month ’s jobs report for example offers 42 pages ’ worth of figures that allow anyone who knows how to read them an infinite variety of ways to examine the labor market . No one forces you to treat the standard unemployment rate as gospel it ’s just a convention and any economic analysts worthy of their spreadsheets use a wide range of data to assess how things are going . So if the White House wants to choose a different measure of job market health to emphasize on the first Friday of every month we ’re all ears . The nice thing about a convention is you can change it . Here in fact is a menu of labor market measures that might be plausible alternatives to the main number — and why the Trump administration may or may not want the world to watch it . Underemployment . The Bureau of Labor Statistics publishes six different unemployment rates from a relatively narrow definition to relatively broad . The jobless rate most often cited is the third of the six known in bureaucratese as and includes only people who say they want a job and have actively looked for one in the last month . The broadest of these unemployment rates also includes people who want a job but haven ’t looked in the last month and people who have a job but want work . That rate : 9. 4 percent . Share of population not employed . If Mr. Trump really believes the 42 percent unemployment rate he floated last year is a useful measure of joblessness here ’s the math that almost gets him there . The proportion of the adult population that is working is 59 . 9 percent so the remainder of that — the share of American adults not working — was 40 . 1 percent in January . Think of it as a measure of not the more precisely defined unemployment . There are some problems with that measure . It includes people who are not working and who have no desire whatsoever to do so . It includes 17 high school students retirees
" The Metropolitan Opera ’s new production of Dvorak ’s “ Rusalka ” may be the unlikeliest hit of the season a staging that takes opera ’s answer to “ The Little Mermaid ” fairy tale and turns it into an almost shockingly dark sexy drama . The mysterious look of the production fantastical and ominous combines with the sensual singing of a handsome cast to create a romantic energy rare at the Met — or at any opera house . When this project was first announced “ Rusalka ” seemed a promising match for the director Mary Zimmerman best known for casting fairy tale magic in her Tony “ Metamorphoses . ” But many were wary . Her three previous productions for the company though full of ideas were all variously disappointing . With this “ Rusalka ” though Ms. Zimmerman comes into her own as a director at the Met . Working with the set designer Daniel Ostling the costume designer Mara Blumenfeld and the lighting designer T. J. Gerckens Ms. Zimmerman has explored the dark complexities of this fable . At the opening on Thursday Mark Elder conducted a glowing account of Dvorak ’s score . And the Met has assembled a matchless cast led by the lovely soprano Kristine Opolais who gives a vocally lustrous and achingly vulnerable performance as Rusalka the water nymph who falls in love with a human prince . Even in the unusual love scenes between the prince and the silent Rusalka who has given up her voice to become mortal Ms. Zimmerman has coaxed simmering tension from Ms. Opolais and the dashing tenor Brandon Jovanovich . The director has said that this opera carries a wise warning : If you have to transform yourself drastically to the point of literally losing your voice
" Beach and spa vacations are typically associated with relaxation while urban getaways tend to be all go go go but that doesn ’t always have to be the case according to Michael Bonsor the hotel manager of Rosewood London . “ You can absolutely head to a city for a relaxing vacation ” he said . Here Mr. Bonsor shares his tips on how to have a trip in a busy city setting : SET THE MOOD BEFOREHAND Use the journey to your destination as an opportunity to get into vacation mode : If you ’re flying use a pair of headphones and order a glass of Champagne or another drink you enjoy when you get on board . And watch movies or listen to music on your iPad or on the airline ’s entertainment system . If you ’re driving plan to hit the road when it isn ’t rush hour so you don ’t spend hours sitting in traffic have a playlist on hand with your favorite songs and carry indulgent snacks such as a bar of good chocolate . The idea Mr. Bonsor said is to start unwinding before your vacation starts . PICK A MANAGEABLE CITY Large cities like New York City Paris and Tokyo usually don ’t lend themselves to relaxation because visitors are often overwhelmed by the number of attractions and can tire themselves out trying to take them all in . Smaller cities such as Vancouver British Columbia San Miguel de Allende Mexico and Washington while still appealing are more manageable . “ You might want to hit a site or two but there ’s not that feeling of sensory overload that comes with larger urban settings ” Mr. Bonsor said . HOTEL LOCATION MATTERS Maximize your getaway by staying in a neighborhood you want to explore — you will probably be able to get around by walking or biking and won ’t waste time commuting to other parts of town . If you like shopping choose a property in the city ’s main shopping district . If art is of interest
" The videotaped sucker punch that staggered the white nationalist Richard Spencer on Inauguration Day quickly inspired mockery on social media . But it echoed loudly in an escalating confrontation between extreme ends of the political spectrum . With groups edging into the mainstream with the rise of President Trump and anarchists are vowing to confront them at every turn and by any means necessary — including violence . In Berkeley Calif. on Wednesday night masked protesters set fires smashed windows and stormed buildings on the campus of the University of California to shut down a speech by Milo Yiannopoulos an inflammatory Breitbart News editor and a provocateur already barred from Twitter . Five people were injured administrators canceled the event and the university police locked down the campus for hours . That followed a bloody melee in Seattle on Inauguration Day Jan. 20 when demonstrators — their faces concealed to minimize the risk of arrest — tried to prevent a speech by Mr. Yiannopoulos at the University of Washington and a was shot and seriously wounded by a supporter of Mr. Yiannopoulos . The outbreaks of destruction and violence since Mr. Trump ’s inauguration have earned contempt from Republicans — including Trump supporters who say it is exactly why they voted for his promises of law and order — and condemnation from Democrats like Berkeley ’s mayor Jesse Arreguín . He called Wednesday ’s display “ contrary to progressive values ” and said it “ provided the ultranationalist far right exactly the images they want ” to try to discredit peaceful protesters of Mr. Trump ’s policies . But anarchists and who often make up a small but disproportionately portion of protesters defend the mayhem they create as a necessary response to an emergency . “ Yes what the black bloc did last night was destructive to property ” Eric Laursen a writer in Massachusetts who has helped publicize anarchist protests said using another name for the demonstrators . “ But do you just let someone like Milo go wherever he wants and spread his hate ? That kind of argument can devolve into ‘ just sit on your hands and wait for it to pass . ’ And it doesn’t . ” Anarchists also say their recent efforts have been wildly successful both by focusing attention on their most urgent argument — that Mr. Trump poses a fascist threat — and by enticing others to join their movement . “ The number of people who have been showing up to meetings
" BERKELEY Calif. — Fires burned in the cradle of free speech . Furious at a lecture organized on campus demonstrators wearing outfits smashed windows threw rocks at the police and stormed a building . The speech ? The university called it off . Protest has been synonymous with the University of California Berkeley from the earliest days of the free speech movement when students fought to expand political expression on campus beginning in 1964 . Those protests would set off student activism movements that roiled campuses across the country throughout the 1960 s . Since then countless demonstrators have flocked to Sproul Plaza each day to have their voices heard on issues from civil rights and apartheid to Israel tuition costs and more . But now the university is under siege for canceling a speech by the incendiary writer Milo Yiannopoulos and words like intolerance long used by the left are being used by critics to condemn the protests on Wednesday night that ultimately prevented Mr. Yiannopoulos from speaking . Naweed Tahmas a junior who is a member of the Berkeley College Republicans the group that invited Mr. Yiannopoulos to campus said the cancellation had made him more determined to fight for freedom of speech on campus . “ I ’m tired of getting silenced as many conservative students are ” he said . “ If we support freedom of speech we should support all speech including what they consider hate speech . ” When the event was canceled the Republican student group reacted by writing on their Facebook page “ the Free Speech Movement is dead . ” More than 100 faculty members signed a letter opposing the visit by Mr. Yiannopoulos in recent weeks . “ We support robust debate but we cannot abide by harassment slander
" ATLANTA — The most arresting vista in town comes into view around a curve on westbound Freedom Parkway on the periphery of downtown . The road crests just before it intersects Boulevard at a traffic light that always seems to glow red as if to allow motorists a minute to savor the panorama before them . The striking thing is not the majesty of the skyline but its accessibility — here I am the city beckons come and gawk . For from that vantage point Atlanta just is : a mecca the cradle of the civil rights movement a magnet for transplants a college football locus the shimmering capital of the South and more . All of which are accurate but still do not capture the city ’s nuances . “ I don ’t think people understand Atlanta ” Doug Hertz said . Aside from his schooling at Tulane in New Orleans Hertz 64 has lived here his entire life which makes him a rarity . The city teems with people who moved here for work school family
" Where did all the rocker guys go ? In recent years women have almost completely taken over the most highly visible gig in American pop : the Super Bowl halftime show 12 minutes of music beamed worldwide . It is a ratings magnet a marketing tool a sponsor ’s flagship a cultural event and of course a live performance with no second chances to be applauded or ruthlessly dissected virtually in real time via every internet resource . This Sunday the halftime for the 51st Super Bowl belongs to Lady Gaga along with if preview video clips can be trusted dozens of dancers for a set that will include “ Bad Romance . ” Lady Gaga has neither revealed any guests nor ruled out the possibility . Nor has she telegraphed whether her set will have any direct political messages . Lady Gaga has plenty to prove . Her 2016 album “ Joanne ” made a show of being more vulnerable and less glossy than her previous pop albums bringing back the rock guitars she had welcomed on “ Born This Way ” in 2011 and set aside on “ Artpop ” in 2013 . “ Joanne ” entered the Billboard 200 at No. 1 but faded fast its lead single
" PARIS — A man armed with two large knives and shouting “ God is great ” in Arabic lunged at a military patrol near an entrance to the Louvre on Friday causing little harm but rattling a city already on edge over terrorist attacks and casting another shadow over its international image . A soldier opened fire hitting the attacker several times but not before he slashed at one of the other soldiers causing minor injuries . The Paris prosecutor François Molins said the attacker who was 29 years old was believed to be an Egyptian who arrived in France on Jan. 26 from Dubai in the United Arab Emirates on a visa he obtained last November . The intervention by soldiers from the 1er Régiment de Chasseurs Parachutistes an airborne unit based in Pamiers in southwestern France “ ended a terrorist attack and enabled the arrest of its perpetrator who by all indications was very determined ” Mr. Molins said . The assault took place on a stairway leading down to the Carrousel du Louvre an underground shopping mall that lies between the subway station closest to the museum and one of the museum ’s entrances . The attack was so close to the Louvre that it lit up social media networks . Within a couple hours of the assault President Trump wrote on Twitter that the man was a “ radical Islamic terrorist ” although the French authorities said it was too early to establish whether he had ties to any terrorist groups . Mr. Molins who is known for sticking to the facts
" The Macy ’s of today grew from the union of several great names in American retailing including its namesake chain Bloomingdale ’s and Marshall Field’s . But the ambitious owner of Saks Fifth Avenue has broached the idea of taking the union even further combining with Macy ’s to create a department store juggernaut at a time when the industry is reeling . Hudson ’s Bay Company the Canadian owner of Saks has approached Macy ’s about a potential takeover people briefed on the matter who were not authorized to speak publicly said on Friday . Talks between the two companies are at an early stage and may still fall apart or lead to a partnership of some kind rather than a sale . While it is unclear whether a deal will happen a combination could lift the fortunes of Macy ’s the country ’s biggest department store which has been struggling . Investors certainly appeared to see it that way . Shares of Macy ’s rose as much as 12 percent on Friday its biggest intraday gain since Aug. 11 according to data from Bloomberg . Once a retail titan Macy ’s has struggled to remain relevant as and discount retailers have decimated the traditional business . Last month Macy ’s announced plans to cut more than 10000 jobs and close some of its 880 stores . Terry Lundgren its chief executive and the architect of Macy ’s last big merger is expected to step down by the end of March . He will be succeeded by the company ’s president Jeffrey Gennette . Since the recession shoppers have grown accustomed to hunt for bargains and to not pay full price . Discount stores and outlet malls have flourished . Traditional stores have been compelled to respond by trimming prices which cuts into their margins . Departments stores have been hit especially hard particularly as shoppers migrate away from malls . What has emerged
" SEOUL South Korea — The chief of North Korea ’s powerful secret police long considered the man for the top leader Kim has been dismissed on charges of corruption and abuse of power the South Korean government said on Friday . The firing of the chief Gen. Kim as minister of state security highlights the turmoil that has engulfed the upper reaches of Mr. Kim ’s government . The general is the latest in a series of party and military officials Mr. Kim has fired demoted or executed as he tried to consolidate his totalitarian power through what South Korean officials and North Korean defectors have called a “ reign of terror . ” General Kim was fired in after he was demoted to a general from a one said Jeong a spokesman for the South ’s Unification Ministry . The general ’s surprise downfall was the latest indication that even top lieutenants are at risk as Mr. Kim has rival agencies monitor one another to detect and punish any sign of disrespect or disloyalty . Until his dismissal General Kim had been Mr. Kim ’s chief henchman in purging potential enemies . “ Kim has been a key aide to Kim and has buttressed his reign of terror ” Mr. Jeong said . “ His dismissal could further deepen unrest among officials and add to the instability of the regime by weakening its control on the people . ” Mr. Jeong said General Kim was accused of corruption and held responsible for various human rights violations including torture committed at his agency . But other political machinations could be at play behind the dismissal Mr. Jeong said citing speculation about a rivalry among different power centers . Mr. Jeong noted that the dismissal resulted from an investigation by another powerful agency the Organization and Guidance Department of the governing Workers ’ Party of North Korea . The department supervises all state agencies and is reportedly directly overseen by Mr. Kim . “ The Organization and Guidance Department is conducting an intensive investigation of Kim and the Ministry of State Security so the level of punishment and the number of people affected could be expanded ” Mr. Jeong said without disclosing how the South Korean government learned of the reported purge transpiring inside a secretive regime . The Ministry of State Security which serves as the secret police and intelligence agency in the North is one of the most feared tools of government there responsible for arresting dissidents and running a network of prison gulags . When Mr. Kim executed his own uncle and No. 2 official
" Marches have been the theme of the past couple weekends . There was the women ’s march in Washington and around the world two weekends ago . And last weekend there was the March for Life an annual protest against abortion . The Times called the people who marched in the latter march “ marchers ” in two headlines to the ire of several readers . On the home page the link to the briefing of the story read : “ Pence Addresses March for Abortion Foes . ” We went to Phil Corbett the associate managing editor for standards for his reply . Last weekend there were also protests in response to President Trump ’s executive order to ban refugees . The headline for The Times ’s first story initially read : “ Trump Bars Syrian Refugees Indefinitely to Keep Terrorists Out . ” It was then changed 30 minutes later to : “ Trump Bars Refugees and Citizens of 7 Muslim Countries . ” We asked Peter Blair a copy desk supervisor for a reply . The public editor ’s take : A clear straightforward reply from the copy desk . ( More on how the machinery of editing works in my Sunday column . ) In describing Trump adviser Steve Bannon ’s remarkable new role on the National Security Council The Times used a word that a reader felt was gratuitous . We went back to Corbett on this point . The public editor ’s take : I think the standards editor describes well the challenges of finding the right phrases and avoiding the wrong ones . And I think for the most part editors and reporters work hard to do that . In the case of “ hatch ” though I think it does carry a negative tone not just of secrecy but something rather sinister too . Last October the public editor ’s column addressed The Times ’s purchase of a website called The Wirecutter and its sister site The Sweethome which are in the business of recommending products to customers and making money when customers purchase those products through “ affiliate links ” like say Amazon . com . Through its purchase of these websites The Times hopes to tap a new source of revenue as print advertising rapidly declines . The column argued that this model could be of value to The Times
" What does it mean to “ dress like a woman ” ? Social media users took it upon themselves to answer that very question in response to a report that President Trump wants women who work for him to look a certain way . The sentiment was anonymously cited in the new newsletter Axios from Mike Allen a former Politico reporter . In response Twitter erupted with a stream of photos showing women dressed for the jobs they hold and the lives they lead as firefighters soldiers police officers and astronauts to name a few . But while many of the tweets were aimed at rejecting the idea that women should be restricted to some narrow sartorial category the “ dress like a woman ” phrase as a hashtag didn ’t come directly from Mr. Trump . In his newsletter Mr. Allen attributed the phrase this way : In an email on Friday afternoon Mr. Allen declined to offer any further details . It ’s clear that appearances matter to the president . Mr. Trump the former owner of the Miss Universe Organization has come under harsh criticism for rating women ’s appearances on a scale of one to 10 and for hurling insults at female critics . As a candidate he readily attacked when people commented on the size of his hands or on his hair . Like presidents past Mr. Trump will most likely have some influence over style in the West Wing . The White House does not have an official dress code according to its Press Office but every administration has its own norms . For the past two decades wardrobes have tended to be more relaxed in Democratic administrations . Under President Clinton “ aides frequently attended meetings in jeans and ” The New York Times reported in 2001 . President George W. Bush restored formality to the West Wing but President Obama was so relaxed that he broke with protocol
" Until the Trump presidency became a reality the main order of business in any review of “ 24 : Legacy ” would have been to assess whether the franchise is still viable without Jack Bauer Kiefer Sutherland ’s memorable counterterrorism operative as its lead character . Now though and especially given the events of the past week it ’s the show ’s chosen villains not its hero who demand attention . That ’s because a good number of them speak in foreign accents and some embody President Trump ’s bogyman of the moment the radical Muslim terrorist . This round of “ 24 ” begins Sunday night on Fox after the biggest television can offer the Super Bowl and the first thing viewers will see is foreign terrorists ransacking a home whose owner an Army Ranger is tied to a chair and covered in blood . The intruders have already killed his wife and child . “ This is for Sheik ” one of them says before shooting the ranger in the head . The premiere was filmed back when it seemed unlikely that Mr. Trump would be elected — it was screened in New York on Nov. 7 — but the opening moments play as if they were scripted to support the immigration restrictions he imposed last week . The series grows considerably more layered as it goes along with the panoply of villains encompassing a variety of demographics yet the choice of a bin Laden surrogate as the starting point is sure to reignite the debate over the demonization of Muslims that “ 24 ” has encountered before . The new hero is Eric Carter ( Corey Hawkins of “ Straight Outta Compton ” ) who led the squad of Rangers who killed preventing a devastating attack on the United States . For their safety the Rangers involved were given new identities and jobs but Eric quickly discovers that all but he and Ben Grimes ( Charlie Hofheimer ) an unstable fellow have been tracked down and killed . The men hunting the Rangers
" Corpses of psychiatric patients were found with head injuries and unexplained bruises . Relatives were not informed of the deaths of their loved ones . The transfers of mentally ill patients were seen as business opportunities . Those were some of the findings of a South African government investigation published on Wednesday that determined that 94 psychiatric patients died of negligence last year after being moved by the authorities in Gauteng Province to facilities that were likened in some cases to concentration camps . The report prompted calls for criminal prosecutions . More than 1300 patients under state care were transferred last year from a unit of Life Healthcare Group a private hospital group in South Africa to 27 charitable organizations in an effort by the health department in the province to save money . Pretoria the country ’s administrative capital and Johannesburg are in Gauteng . The investigation was opened last September after 36 patients were found dead after being moved to some of the facilities operated by the charitable organizations . The report by Professor Malegapuru W. Makgoba the South African health ombudsman found that the death toll was nearly 100 however . Investigators found facilities that were overcrowded and “ full of hungry patients ” adding that some were wearing pants held together with shoelaces . Other patients complained of rotten food and said they went weeks without medication . The decision to move the patients “ was unwise and flawed ” the report said “ with inadequate planning and a chaotic and rushed or hurried implementation process . ” All 27 of the organizations operated under invalid licenses it said so patients who were transferred there had died in “ unlawful circumstances . ” The authorities in Gauteng Province along with some of the care centers could not be reached for comment . “ It ’s remarkable that only one person has died from a mental illness ” Professor Makgoba told local new outlets on Wednesday . The others died from “ things like dehydration diarrhea epilepsy
" Popcorn munching . Soup slurping . Nose sniffling . Or simply breathing . Ever wonder why some ordinary sounds drive you crazy ? It ’s called misophonia a mysterious affliction in which seemingly harmless sounds unleash anger anxiety and in some cases panic attacks in some people . If you ’re one of them neuroscientists at Newcastle University in Britain say they may have found an explanation for what ails you . In a report on the latest study published Thursday in the journal Current Biology the neuroscientists say that brain scans of misophonia sufferers show that particular sounds like eating and drinking cause the part of their brain that processes emotions the anterior insular cortex to go into overdrive . That region in sufferers was also connected differently compared to normal brains to the amygdala and the hippocampus areas that are involved in recalling past experiences said Dr. Sukhbinder Kumar the lead researcher from the Institute of Neuroscience at Newcastle University . “ We think that misophonia may be heavily connected to recalling past memories because people with misophonia have had very bad experiences ” he said in a phone interview Friday . The research opens up the possibilities of future therapy for those afflicted with misophonia a term coined by the American scientists Pawel and Margaret Jastreboff in 2001 . A survey of nearly 200 misophonia sufferers showed that the average age at which they first became aware of the condition was 12
" In one of the strongest protests yet by a major cultural institution against President Trump ’s executive order on immigration the Museum of Modern Art has rehung part of its permanent collection with works by artists from some of the nations whose citizens are blocked from entering the United States . Seven works by artists such as the Sudanese painter Ibrahim the architect Zaha Hadid and the Los Iranian video artist Tala Madani were installed Thursday night in MoMA ’s galleries replacing seven works by Picasso Matisse and Picabia among other Western artists . Alongside each work is a wall text that plainly states the museum ’s intentions : “ This work is by an artist from a nation whose citizens are being denied entry into the United States according to a presidential executive order issued on Jan. 272017 . This is one of several such artworks from the Museum ’s collection installed throughout the galleries to affirm the ideals of welcome and freedom as vital to this Museum as they are to the United States . ” Except for Hadid and Mr. the other artists are all Iranian by birth or heritage . They are Ms. Madani the sculptor Parviz Tanavoli the draftsman Charles Hossein Zenderoudi the photographer Shirana Shahbazi and the painter Marcos Grigorian . In addition a large sculpture of aluminum and steel by Siah Armajani an American artist born in Iran was placed in the lobby courtyard overlooking the garden . The additions rupture the museum ’s traditional narrative of Western modernism before 1945 . Only very rarely has MoMA interrupted its succession of art from to Cubism Dadaism and after — which still reflects the modernist vision of its first director Alfred Barr — with works of postwar and contemporary art. Further additions are planned for the weeks ahead . The Museum of Modern Art has also scheduled four screenings later this month of films by directors subject to the travel ban . They include “ ” ( 1974 ) an experimental feature by the German director Kais and “ Stars in Broad Daylight ” ( 1988 ) by Oussama Mohammad a Syrian filmmaker exiled in Paris . "
2017.02.0"BEIJING — President Trump may not be known for his diplomacy but someone in his family appears to be picking up the slack . That would be Arabella his granddaughter . A video of her singing “ Happy New Year ” in Chinese has gone viral on social media in China . Arabella has been taking Chinese lessons . Arabella ’s mother Ivanka Trump posted the song on her Instagram account on Thursday . “ Arabella singing a song she learned for #ChineseNewYear . Wishing everyone an amazing year to come during these days of celebration ” Ms. Trump wrote on her account . Arabella appeared in a black cardigan with ornate pockets and skinny black pants and she played with a Chinese marionette as she sang . On Weibo China ’s version of Twitter more than 60000 people said they liked Arabella ’s song . Some of them said they much preferred her to Mr. Trump who has stirred the relationship over Taiwan and the South China Sea among other things . “ The granddaughter is much more sensible ” said one . Another Weibo user noted “ Her Mandarin is perfect . ” Some people were more critical : “ So you want to get the Chinese off your back with just this song ? ” However this was not Arabella ’s first diplomatic coup this week . On Wednesday evening she and her mother turned up at a New Year ’s reception at the Chinese Embassy in Washington . A beaming Chinese ambassador Cui Tiankai escorted the pair around the party
" PARIS — Michel Onfray a French pop philosopher was sounding pretty upbeat on the phone even though the title of his latest book is “ Decadence : The Life and Death of the Tradition . ” His book had just come out with an impressive press run of 120000 copies and was selling briskly in spite of — or perhaps because of — its gloomy prognostication . “ If you think today about terrorism the rise of populism it was important to put that in perspective ” Mr. Onfray said recently . His research he added “ shows a civilization that had been strong that had ceased to be so and that ’s heading toward its end . ” Mr. Onfray is one of the latest popular authors to join France ’s booming decline industry a spate of books and articles ( with a handful of TV shows ) that explore the country ’s ( and the West’s ) failings and France ’s obsession with those failings . ( Last year the word “ déclinisme ” or “ declinism ” entered France ’s Larousse dictionary . ) It ’s a phenomenon that cuts across the political spectrum and has picked up velocity in recent years by tapping into an anxious national mood . And its loudest voices are intellectuals with platforms in the national news media . Beyond Mr. Onfray ’s other books with decline on their minds have appeared in the past few weeks . “ The Returned ” a best seller by the journalist David Thomson is an investigative report about French jihadists who ’ve returned home from Syria . “ A Submissive France : Voices of Defiance ” compiles interviews on France ’s troubled banlieues or suburbs
" WEST PALM BEACH Fla . — A federal appeals court early Sunday rejected a request by the Justice Department to immediately restore President Trump ’s targeted travel ban deepening a legal showdown over his authority to tighten the nation ’s borders in the name of protecting Americans from terrorism . In the legal back and forth over the travel ban the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit in San Francisco said a reply from the Trump administration was now due on Monday . The ruling meant that travelers from seven predominantly Muslim nations — Iran Iraq Libya Somalia Sudan Syria and Yemen — as well as vetted refugees from all nations could for now continue to enter the country . Those foreigners had been barred by an executive order signed by the president on Jan. 27 . After a Federal District Court in Seattle blocked Mr. Trump ’s order nationwide on Friday the Justice Department appealed the ruling late Saturday saying that the president had the constitutional authority to order the ban and that the court ruling “ the president ’s national security judgment . ” On Saturday night as Mr. Trump arrived at a Red Cross gala at his waterfront Florida resort where he was spending the first getaway weekend of his presidency reporters asked him if he was confident he would prevail in the government ’s appeal . “ We ’ll win ” he replied . “ For the safety of the country we ’ll win . ” The legal maneuvering led Mr. Trump to lash out at Judge James Robart of the Federal District Court in Seattle throughout the day prompting criticism that the president had failed to respect the judicial branch and its power to check on his authority . In a Twitter post on Saturday Mr. Trump wrote “ The opinion of this judge
" While President Trump ’s travel ban threw American airports into chaos last weekend Bob Ferguson the attorney general of Washington State was biding his time on an airplane . On his way home from a conference of Democratic attorneys general in Florida Mr. Ferguson landed a week ago in the center of a political and legal firestorm . International Airport was in disarray with protests massing . Gov. Jay Inslee a fellow Democrat had sent word to the attorney general ’s staff that he wanted to mount a attack on the president ’s decree . Within two days Mr. Ferguson had become a leading combatant in a battle with the president of the United States filing a dramatic challenge to Mr. Trump ’s travel ban that yielded a ruling from a federal judge on Friday freezing the order ’s implementation . A genial with an earnest demeanor Mr. Ferguson cuts an unlikely figure as an antagonist for the most pugilistic president in modern times . He is seen in the state less as a showman than as a former member of the King County Council with a wonky sensibility and an eager manner . But Mr. Ferguson by his own account and the description of his associates was incensed and offended by Mr. Trump ’s sweeping immigration restrictions . And having landed in Seattle on the first full day the ban was in effect — while demonstrations grew across the country — he went home to greet his family and then went to work devising a plan to cripple Mr. Trump ’s new policy . In an interview Mr. Ferguson said he had concluded from the start that Mr. Trump ’s order was “ unlawful and unconstitutional ” and that any appropriate response would have to aim at neutering it entirely . Eschewing the approach of other states which have challenged Mr. Trump ’s order by highlighting the claims of individual plaintiffs Mr. Ferguson and his office opted to draft a complaint arguing that the ban would cause drastic damage to Washington State as a whole . Mr. Ferguson said that the state solicitor general Noah Purcell a former Supreme Court clerk for David H. Souter had suggested last weekend that the state enlist major private companies as allies . And so the attorney general spoke by telephone with a host of executives including the corporate counsels of Expedia and Amazon
2017.02.0"WASHINGTON — Judge Neil M. Gorsuch ’s first taste of Washington politics was bitter and lingering . He was 15 years old and his mother was a official in the Reagan administration caught in an ugly showdown with Congress . When she was forced to step down her reputation in tatters young Neil was furious . “ You should never have resigned ” he told his mother Anne Gorsuch Burford by her later account . “ You didn ’t do anything wrong . You only did what the president ordered . Why are you quitting ? You raised me not to be a quitter . Why are you a quitter ? ” More than three decades later Judge Gorsuch a federal appeals court judge in Denver has been nominated to the Supreme Court by President Trump and faces a political culture even more caustic than the one that destroyed his mother ’s public career . Like her he is a committed conservative and can expect strong opposition but where she was bold and brash he has advanced to the pinnacle of the judiciary with understatement and polish . Now 49 he arrives at his own moment of testing as a child of the Reagan revolution who saw up close the promise and the perils . He inherited a frontier skepticism of government rooted in his home of Colorado and nurtured in Washington during the 1980 s . An examination of his early formative years finds that he swam in the liberal waters of Columbia and Harvard and rebelled against the dominant thinking to develop a fully formed conservative philosophy that has propelled him to the threshold of the Supreme Court . Those early years shaped his views on the law and life and provided a searing lesson in the realities of the political world . Despite the family ordeal friends and relatives said he emerged from the crucible of his youth tempered about politics yet not soured on public service . He decided to pursue goals similar to his mother ’s if only by a different path . The first woman to lead the Environmental Protection Agency Ms. Burford argued that states were better custodians of resources and that market forces would bring more discipline to regulation . As she cut spending and pared back rules critics called her an enemy of the environment . Her downfall came when
" WASHINGTON — Decades before he began writing legal opinions Judge Neil M. Gorsuch President Trump ’s nominee for the Supreme Court was a student columnist at Columbia University . And he had no shortage of opinions . His topics ranged broadly from life on campus to the affair . His conservatism was a constant . And he had a lively writing style that persists to this day . He and his collaborators seemed to sense that their writings would survive the years . “ We ought not forget ” they wrote in an unsigned 1987 editorial for The Federalist Paper which Judge Gorsuch helped start “ there is something vital and useful in the curious if imperfect youth — something that shall not be stifled . ” Here is a selection of that youthful curiosity . While mounting an ultimately unsuccessful bid for a seat on the university Senate as a freshman in 1986 Judge Gorsuch was asked by The Columbia Daily Spectator for his views on issues including the question of whether the Marines should be allowed to recruit on campus . The Spectator commissioned a series of columns on the lessons that should be learned from the affair . Judge Gorsuch whose mother had served in the Reagan administration saw a need for a more decisive American foreign policy . In a February 1987 column he took the university to task for what he called its failure to promote diversity ( “ that cherished buzzword ” ) of thought . In March 1987 Judge Gorsuch argued against making Columbia ’s fraternity system coed as the university more fully integrated women . Writing with his friend Michael Behringer in The Federalist Paper Judge Gorsuch a member of Phi Gamma Delta once more cited freedom of association . In 1988 Columbia was embroiled in debates about its fraternities new university rules governing protests and a student council election . Judge Gorsuch
" WASHINGTON — The Trump White House appears to have backed off for now on its consideration of reopening overseas “ black site ” prisons where the C. I. A. once tortured terrorism suspects after a leaked draft executive order prompted bipartisan pushback from Congress and cabinet officials . On Thursday the White House circulated among National Security Council staff members a revised version of the draft order on detainees that deleted language contemplating a revival of the C. I. A. prisons according to several officials familiar with its contents . The draft order retains other parts of the original that focus on making greater use of the military ’s Guantánamo Bay prison which the Obama administration had tried to close . Those sections reflecting repeated vows from President Trump include a call to bring newly captured terrorism detainees there and to freeze plans for any more transfers . After news outlets reported details of the original draft on Jan. 25 lawmakers erupted in outrage and both the defense secretary Jim Mattis and the C. I. A. director Mike Pompeo disavowed any prior knowledge of the contemplated order . Elisa Massimino the president of Human Rights First who had been among those who criticized the original draft praised the revisions . “ It sounds like a smart reaction to the reaction to the leaked draft ” she said . “ Transparency is a good corrective to overreach and it provides the opportunity for more careful consideration of the broader implications of an order like this . ” In addition to the change on C. I. A. prisons the revised draft unlike the original
" WASHINGTON — The document carried the title “ A Roadmap to Repeal ” a concise list of Obama administration environmental regulations that a Koch group was pressing President Trump and Congress to quickly reverse after Inauguration Day . It was a tally of rules that energy industry executives and lobbyists had waged a futile fight against for eight years donating millions of dollars to lawmakers who vowed to help block them filing lawsuits to try to overturn them and hiring experts to generate reports that questioned the need for them . But in a flurry of activity this past week Congress did what Charles G. and David H. Koch — who own a conglomerate that sells hundreds of products including gasoline jet fuel and coal — and other industry leaders had been asking for . Using a rarely invoked law the Congress nullified a measure intended to curb the venting of gas wells on federal lands and began the process of rolling back other regulations including one enacted to limit damage that coal mines cause to streams — each items on the “ Roadmap to Repeal . ” On Friday with his own executive orders Mr. Trump took up two more items on the list including a call to rewrite major provisions of the Act legislation crafted by the Obama administration and passed by Congress in response to the 2008 financial meltdown . Not since the Reagan administration has Washington moved so quickly to roll back or nullify so many federal regulations one of the clearest signs of an abrupt shift of power in a government now under control that has flipped the script of winners and losers . “ It is a big fat victory after all this time ” said Luke Popovich a vice president at the National Mining Association an industry trade group . A alliance has now been formed among Congress
" Since the day Donald J. Trump began his presidential campaign there were questions about how the Trump brand would be affected . Would his stream of insults hurt viewership of “ The Apprentice ” or sales of Ivanka Trump shoes ? Or was all the attention good for business a marketing adage President Trump could have learned during his time as a reality television star . The answer may surprise him . Major companies appear to be their relationships with the Trump brand which in some instances does not appear to have benefited from Mr. Trump ’s presidency . Hinting at lackluster sales Neiman Marcus confirmed on Friday that it had dropped Ivanka Trump ’s jewelry line from its website . A day earlier her brand had disappeared from Nordstrom . com a move reported by the fashion news site Racked . Not everyone was happy that retailers were distancing themselves from the Trump name . By Saturday some Twitter users were posting #BoycottNordstrom . Companies also seem worried about how protests over the president ’s actions particularly his recent executive order on immigration could hurt sales . On Friday MillerCoors a brewing company contacted Shannon Coulter a founder of GrabYourWallet . org a campaign pushing for boycotts of Neiman Marcus Nordstrom and other businesses associated with the Trump name . “ He wanted to talk about why they were on the list ” she said adding “ I think all the companies are paying close attention . ” At a time when protests and boycotts can easily be organized online
" BEIJING — China reacted with strong displeasure on Saturday to a promise by Defense Secretary Jim Mattis that the United States would defend two uninhabited islands in the East China Sea that Japan controls but China also claims as its own . Mr. Mattis the first member of President Trump ’s cabinet to visit East Asia had told Japanese officials earlier Saturday that America ’s defense obligations to Japan extended to the disputed rocky outposts known in China as the Diaoyu and in Japan as the Senkaku . The chief spokesman for China ’s Foreign Ministry Lu Kang accused Mr. Mattis of putting regional stability at risk and urged him to forgo what he called a Cold War mentality . “ We urge the U. S. side to take a responsible attitude stop making wrong remarks on the issue involving the Diaoyu islands ’ sovereignty and avoid making the issue more complicated and bringing instability to the regional situation ” Mr. Lu said in a statement posted on the ministry ’s website . He described the 1960 defense treaty between the United States and Japan which Mr. Mattis cited in pledging to defend the islands as a “ product of the Cold War which should not impair China ’s territorial sovereignty and legitimate rights . ” Mr. Mattis was not staking out a new American position while in office President Barack Obama said that the United States would defend the islands . But the defense secretary ’s words were reassuring to Japanese officials who had been unnerved by Mr. Trump ’s remarks as a presidential candidate suggesting that he might reduce America ’s military commitments to its Asian allies . The disputed islands have been among a number of potential points of contention as China builds up its presence in the East and South China Seas . Chinese and Japanese vessels regularly maneuver at close quarters in the waters as China tries to challenge Japan ’s control of the islands . Last year China sent a warship to within 24 miles of the islands . President Xi Jinping of China declared much of the East China Sea to be a Chinese air defense zone in 2013 and since then China has regularly sent fighter jets to patrol the area . At a news conference in Tokyo Mr. Mattis cited Article 5 of the United treaty which commits the United States to defend Japan or territories that it administers against attack . “ I made clear that our longstanding policy on the Senkaku Islands stands — the U. S. will continue to recognize Japanese administration of the islands ” Mr. Mattis said . “ And as such Article 5 of the U. S. security treaty applies . ” Before going to Japan Mr. Mattis went to South Korea to offer assurances to that ally about defense commitments
" Just days before his inauguration Donald J. Trump stood beside his tax lawyer at a Midtown Manhattan news conference as she announced that he planned to place his vast business holdings in a trust a move she said would allay fears that he might exploit the Oval Office for personal gain . However a number of questions were left unanswered — including who would ultimately benefit from the trust — raising concerns about just how meaningful the move was . Now records have emerged that show just how closely tied Mr. Trump remains to the empire he built . While the president says he has walked away from the operations of his business two people close to him are the named trustees and have broad legal authority over his assets : his eldest son Donald Jr . and Allen H. Weisselberg the Trump Organization ’s chief financial officer . Mr. Trump who will receive reports on any profit or loss on his company as a whole can revoke their authority at any time . What ’s more the purpose of the Donald J. Trump Revocable Trust is to hold assets for the “ exclusive benefit ” of the president . This trust remains under Mr. Trump ’s Social Security number at least as far as federal taxes are concerned . Since his election there have been widespread calls for Mr. Trump to sell his assets and put the proceeds in a blind trust . He has resisted those calls stressing that the president has no legal obligation to do so . While the trust structure outlined in documents made public through a Freedom of Information Act request by ProPublica may give the president the appearance of distance from his business it drew sharp criticism from experts in government ethics . “ I don ’t see how this in the slightest bit avoids a conflict of interest ” said Frederick J. Tansill a trust and estates lawyer from Virginia who examined the documents at the request of The New York Times . “ First it is revocable at any time
" A Russian technology executive who was named in a dossier containing unverified allegations about connections between President Trump and the Russian government has sued BuzzFeed News which published the information . The defamation suit was filed in court on Friday in Broward County Fla . according to lawyers for the executive Aleksej Gubarev the chief of XBT a technology company based in Luxembourg . The suit focuses on allegations made near the end of the dossier that Mr. Gubarev and his company were involved in hacking operations against the leadership of the Democratic Party . In the complaint Mr. Gubarev ’s lawyers say that BuzzFeed acted recklessly that none of the statements have any basis in fact and that Mr. Gubarev ’s association with the dossier has left his reputation “ in tatters ” compromised his family ’s security and damaged his company ’s business prospects . It called BuzzFeed ’s decision “ perhaps one of the most reckless and irresponsible moments in modern ‘ journalism . ’ ” The publishing of the dossier was one of the most startling moments of the weeks before Mr. Trump ’s inauguration . Compiled by a former British intelligence operative who was hired by Mr. Trump ’s Republican rivals and later by supporters of Hillary Clinton the document had circulated for months among government officials and journalists . The veracity of its claims had been investigated but never proved . But after CNN reported last month that intelligence officials had presented a summary of the allegations to Mr. Trump and President Barack Obama BuzzFeed decided to publish the document in full saying that “ Americans can make up their own minds about allegations about the that have circulated at the highest levels of the U. S. government . ” When it published the dossier BuzzFeed noted that it contained errors and that its claims had not been verified . The publication ’s editor in chief Ben Smith later wrote that its reporters in the United States and Europe spent weeks investigating the report . BuzzFeed ignited a debate over both the claims in the report as well as the outlet ’s decision to break from typical journalistic practices in publishing it . Mr. Trump denounced the unproven claims as a smear and called BuzzFeed a “ failing pile of garbage ” during a heated news conference on Jan. 11 . Mr. Gubarev ’s lawsuit claims that while more than 30 publications tried to contact him after the dossier ’s publication he was not contacted by BuzzFeed for his response to the allegations . Mr. Gubarev 36 lives in Cyprus with his wife and three children . He founded the site Webzilla — which is also identified in the report the complaint notes — and built it into an international business
" Need to book a hotel on the go or a friendly dinner recommendation while exploring a new city ? There ’s a bot for that . In fact there are now chatbots for all kinds of things from weather updates to health advice as the popularity of smartphone messaging apps driven by artificial intelligence grows . Mobile messaging apps were used by 1. 6 billion people in 2016 and will reach two billion in 2018 or 80 percent of all smartphone users according to the digital data researcher eMarketer . Another sign of their growing influence was evident last April when Facebook announced it was opening its Messenger app to any outside company that wants to integrate its own bots into the chat program . Now the booking services Expedia Kayak Skyscanner and many others are allowing potential customers to seek recommendations on hotel rooms and flights and book them via Facebook Messenger . Several other bots have sprung up in recent months providing services like bookings and tips for activities with a robotic touch . The technology is young and while most of these chatbots have yet to become viable alternatives to existing travel planning options like Trip Advisor and traditional guides it could be only a matter of time before our culture embraces booking by text . Here is what three of the more interesting options have to offer so far : SnapTravel aims to find you a hotel based on your budget and preferences via SMS Facebook Messenger or Slack .

" BUENOS AIRES — Argentina is so used to celebrating immigration as a cornerstone of society that a saying — to govern is to populate — remains in use to this day . But in an abrupt shift coinciding with the immigration restrictions put in place by the Trump administration President Mauricio Macri has issued a decree curbing immigration to Argentina with his government declaring that newcomers from poorer countries in Latin America bring crime . The measures announced by Mr. Macri in recent days made it much easier to deport immigrants and restrict their entry prompting irate comparisons to President Trump and igniting a fierce debate over immigration . “ A decree like this scares people ” said Arfang Diedhiou 33 a Senegalese immigrant who runs his own clothing store here in the capital Buenos Aires . “ It came out just after what Trump did a coincidence that seems very strange to me . ” Argentina ’s president the son of an immigrant has echoed some of Mr. Trump ’s “ America First ” theme making it clear that his “ first concern ” should be “ caring for Argentines caring for ourselves . ” “ We cannot continue to allow criminals to keep choosing Argentina as a place to commit offenses ” Mr. Macri said during a news conference . His decree has also rekindled criticism of his ties to the American president whom he calls a friend . In the 1980 s Mr. Macri worked with his father an Italian immigrant and industrial magnate on a real estate project in New York that the family ended up selling to Mr. Trump . Mr. Macri ’s immigration measures while not as as Mr. Trump ’s decision to halt refugees from around the world and freeze visas from seven predominantly Muslim nations are raising diplomatic tensions in the region . Some South American leaders are attacking what they view as an attempt to mimic Mr. Trump ’s immigration policies and nurture xenophobic sentiment . “ Brothers Latin American presidents
" HOUSTON — Atlanta Falcons quarterback Matt Ryan was named the N. F. L. ’s most valuable player on Saturday 24 hours before he was to try to cap his superb season with Super Bowl glory . Ryan 31 got his first M. V. P. Award by collecting 25 of the votes while his opposite number in Sunday ’s Super Bowl the New England Patriots ’ Tom Brady finished with 10 . Brady has won the award twice for the 2007 and 2010 seasons . Ryan ’s award came after a dazzling season for Atlanta ’s offense in which he finished with 4944 passing yards 38 touchdowns and only seven interceptions . Super Bowl LI on Sunday will be his first appearance in the title game . Brady who is chasing his fifth Super Bowl victory finished the season with 3554 passing yards 28 touchdowns and two interceptions but played in four fewer games than Ryan because of his Deflategate suspension . Unsurprisingly Ryan also picked up the Offensive Player of the Year Award . Ryan had the best season of his career after spending last summer working intensively on his throwing motion at a Los Angeles training camp . He averaged slightly over nine yards per pass the highest rate ever for a quarterback with more than 400 completions in a season . The Defensive Player of the Year Award went to the Oakland Raiders ’ Khalil Mack whose season included 11 sacks five forced fumbles three fumble recoveries and an interception returned for a touchdown as the Raiders reached the playoffs . Dallas Cowboys quarterback Dak Prescott was a surprise pick ahead of his teammate Ezekiel Elliott for offensive rookie of the year .

" HOUSTON — Commissioner Roger Goodell of the N. F. L. declined to take a public stance last week on President Trump ’s executive order temporarily banning visits by citizens from seven predominantly Muslim countries even as leaders in the N. B. A. spoke out against the order . But the owner Shahid Khan of the Jacksonville Jaguars made it clear Saturday that he was opposed to the ban and said he had been heartened on Friday when a federal judge in Seattle temporarily blocked the president ’s immigration order . “ The bedrock of this country are immigration and really a great separation between church and state ” Mr. Khan 66 said in Houston the site of Sunday ’s Super Bowl . “ Even for the country it ’s not good ” he added explaining that he thought the order could deny entry to some of “ the tens of thousands of people who can contribute to the making of America . ” The only Muslim among the principal owners of N. F. L. teams Mr. Khan came to the United States from Pakistan in 1967 earned a degree in engineering and went on to own a car parts business . He became a United States citizen decades ago . Mr. Khan said it was “ kind of a sobering time for somebody like me ” in part because he had expected Mr. Trump to moderate his views on immigrants and Muslims once in office . But Mr. Khan said he hoped the courts would provide a bulwark against the president ’s actions against immigrants . He said he understood Mr. Goodell ’s decision not to make a public statement to avoid the appearance of “ grandstanding ” on the president ’s action . Instead Mr. Khan said the league should see how the issue plays out in court . “ We have to look at it based on what can we do to make a difference ” he said . “ And right now there are enough forces in power and play that we have to see how this thing ends up . ” Mr. Khan has been a vocal supporter of a bill in Jacksonville Fla . that would expand the city ’s human rights ordinance to offer more protection for people who are gay lesbian bisexual or transgender . Similar laws have passed in other cities in nearly two dozen states . Mr. Khan said that he knew endorsing the bill might alienate some Jaguars fans but that he was willing to risk cancellations . “ I have no remorse over supporting it ” he said of the nondiscrimination bill .

" The bad news had been building for months at the Metropolitan Museum of Art. Even as crowds poured into shows on Hellenistic kingdoms and fashion the Met ’s deficit was approaching $ 40 million and had forced the buyout or layoff of some 90 employees . An expansion into a satellite building cost millions of dollars more than expected . A new Met logo and marketing plan were rolled out at great expense — and greeted with ridicule . Then last month a new $ 600 million wing was postponed by several years frustrating the Met ’s efforts to become a serious player in the competitive field of Modern and contemporary art. Tension inside the Met the country ’s largest art museum is running so high that when curators and conservators recently wrote a letter protesting compensation cuts the museum ’s leaders chose not to show it to trustees for fear of leaks and bad publicity . Those who wanted to see the document had to go to the office of the Met ’s general counsel and read it under observation . After enjoying boom years one of the most cultural institutions in the world is now struggling with missteps and the perils of overreaching at a time of uncertain resources . While many museums face financial and competitive pressures the Met ’s troubles are magnified given its stature on the world stage . How can a behemoth like the Met the thinking goes possibly stumble ? Some curators and trustees have zeroed in on Thomas P. Campbell the Met ’s director and chief executive since 2008 as well as the board that has backed him . The anguish can be intense given the love that all involved have for the Met . “ It ’s a tragedy to see a great institution in decline ” said George R. Goldner who in 2014 retired after 21 years as the chairman of the Met ’s drawings and prints department and has since served as a consultant to the museum . “ To have inherited a museum as strong as the Met was 10 years ago — with a great curatorial staff — and to have it be what it is today is unimaginable . ” Several people inside the museum most of whom spoke anonymously for fear of losing their positions said the Met under Mr. Campbell had tried to do too much too fast : overhiring in the digital department overspending on an additional building the Met Breuer
" SOFIA Bulgaria — With one foot in the West and the other in the East Bulgaria has long engaged in a delicate balancing act . But now the country and its new president Rumen Radev will have to learn how to balance Donald J. Trump and an increasingly energized Vladimir V. Putin . Mr. Radev contemplated his new role as balancer in chief two days before he was sworn in on Jan. 19 sitting across the street from the presidential palace in the labyrinthine former headquarters of the Bulgarian Communist Party . “ We have a clear road map to follow ” Mr. Radev said . “ Staying in the E. U. and staying in NATO . But at the same time we have a deep historical relationship with Russia . ” Countries like Bulgaria have spent decades balancing East and West and playing one off the other . But the prospect of President Trump ’s moving closer to Mr. Putin has scrambled that strategy as have the conflicting messages coming out of the new American administration . Mr. Trump has seemed eager for closer Kremlin ties even echoing Moscow ’s disdain for NATO and the European Union . But last week his new ambassador echoed the Obama administration ’s harder line saying the United States would not withdraw sanctions against Russia until the country pulled its troops out of Crimea . At the same time Mr. Putin has been showing new signs of swagger in his dealings with Russia ’s neighbors on Thursday he arrived in Hungary for his first foray into Europe in the Trump era . Bulgaria is an eager member of the European Union but as rising nationalism caused support for the union to wane here and elsewhere Russian influence has crept in . On the surface this suggests that Mr. Trump ’s outreach to Moscow if genuine would be good for Bulgaria — and
" WASHINGTON — The number of people who signed up for health insurance in the federal marketplace that serves most states dipped this year to 9. 2 million the Trump administration said Friday as consumers struggled with confusion over the future of the Affordable Care Act . That represents a decline of more than 4 percent from the total of 9. 63 million people who signed up through HealthCare . gov at this time last year . The numbers do not include activity in the 11 states that run their own online marketplaces under the Affordable Care Act former President Barack Obama ’s signature health care law . State reports suggest that they have signed up about three million people . Veterans of the Obama administration said President Trump ’s opposition to the health law and his efforts to undermine it had taken a toll . People may also have been influenced by signals from Congress that the law would soon be repealed . And some consumers may have been put off by the termination of their health plans which was caused by an exodus of major insurers from the market in many states . Just before leaving office the Obama administration reported that through HealthCare . gov were running slightly ahead of the number at the same time last year with 8. 8 million as of Jan. 14 . “ Trump ’s sabotage worked ” said Ben Wakana who was a spokesman for Sylvia Mathews Burwell the secretary of health and human services under Mr. Obama . “ We were on track to exceed last year ’s total . We expected a million people to sign up on the federal exchange in the final week of the open enrollment period . ” Still the numbers present a challenge to Republicans who are struggling to repeal the law that allowed those millions to purchase insurance plans — and who have promised not to displace anyone covered by it . The fourth annual open enrollment season began Nov. 1 and ended Tuesday 11 days after Mr. Trump took office . The Trump administration scaled back publicity and advertising in the final days of the open enrollment period . Mr. Trump also issued a broadly worded executive order that directed federal officials to waive or delay any provision of the Affordable Care Act that would impose “ a cost fee tax penalty or regulatory burden on individuals . ” The order issued within hours of Mr. Trump ’s inauguration on Jan. 20 did not specify what actions would be taken . But lawyers and health policy experts read it as an indication that the government might not enforce the federal requirement for people to have health insurance or pay a tax penalty . Mr. Trump has described the Affordable Care Act as “ a complete and total disaster ” and has said he wants to replace it with better cheaper coverage “ for everybody ” but he has not offered a plan to achieve that goal .

" If the surprisingly strong job gains in January revealed the economy ’s resilience they also exposed some of its stubborn weaknesses . Yes the government ’s report on Friday showed that employers fattened their payrolls by 227000 workers last month an unexpectedly large increase . And yes public optimism about economic prospects has persuaded a few hundred thousand Americans who had dropped out of the work force to return . But the very fact that so many sidelined workers could be lured back despite meager wage growth is evidence that the labor pool is not as shallow as some have argued . To the labor market bulls consistently low official jobless rates have suggested that the economy is nearing capacity and that inflation lurks . Initial estimates released last month gave the impression that wages had taken a big step forward at the end of last year lifting hopes that the momentum would continue especially with a surge of local increases taking effect across the country . Instead the Labor Department ’s latest figures showed baby steps — slower increases in earnings for December and January bringing average wage growth back down to its disappointing 2. 5 percent trend . “ The increase in participation and drop in wages suggest we ’re not at full employment ” James Athey senior investment manager at Aberdeen Asset Management said . Although officials at the Federal Reserve have said they expect to raise the benchmark interest rate three times this year in response to a strengthening economy they made clear at their session this week that nothing is guaranteed . “ This is just what the doves at the Fed wanted to see ” Mr. Athey said referring to those wary of raising rates and keen to keep the focus on fostering hiring rather than heading off inflation . “ All of the numbers point toward it being more difficult to justify another hike in March ” when Fed members next meet . But just because the job market is not yet drum tight does not mean it is not improving . “ The labor market started 2017 on the front foot ” said Carl R. Tannenbaum chief economist at Northern Trust . “ This is a good
" The federal Bureau of Alcohol Tobacco Firearms and Explosives plans to send more agents to Chicago to help curb a surge in violence that claimed more than 750 lives there last year a spokesman for the bureau ’s Chicago field division said on Friday night . The spokesman David D. Coulson said that sending additional personnel to the city where there were more than 3500 shootings in 2016 has been “ in the works for some time to figure out how to leverage our resources . ” CNN reported that the bureau would send 20 additional agents . Mr. Coulson said he was unsure where that figure originated and that “ everything is fluid . ” A final decision on the number of additional agents will most likely be made in the next week he said . The field division which covers Illinois and parts of Indiana has more than 100 agents . About 35 are assigned to Chicago Mr. Coulson said . The news comes as Chicago the nation ’s third largest city has been reeling from an increase in gun violence a sharply critical Department of Justice report and a series of remarks and postings on Twitter about the city from President Trump . In a tweet on Jan. 24 Mr. Trump threatened to “ send in the Feds ! ” if the city did not fix the “ carnage . ” CNN reported that the agents would be assigned to a “ Chicago Crime Guns Strike Force . ” Mr. Coulson described that as “ probably a good depiction . ” He said that agents already assigned to the city work on firearms trafficking cases cracking down on gangs and those who are prohibited from possessing guns . Adam Collins a spokesman for Mayor Rahm Emanuel said on Friday night that city officials had not been told about the plans for additional federal agents but that the mayor would be glad for their help . “ We have received no word from the federal government to confirm these reports but it would be welcome news if the administration has indeed agreed to one of Mayor Emanuel ’s requests for federal resources

" Certain districts of Bogotá like the Zona G seem to have more types of restaurants than they do people . There are BBQ joints that look straight out of Brooklyn gastro pubs with cocktail gardens and a chain of crepe restaurants that has set up shop in nearly every neighborhood . Yet regional Colombian fare from outside the capital has long been the city ’s weak spot . Until now . As Bogotá has increasingly become a melting pot of cultures from every part of Colombia restaurants focusing on regional dishes and ingredients are opening with regularity . “ We ’re seeing not only an increase in the quality of food and better service in restaurants but a boom of interesting concepts ” said Gaeleen Quinn who founded the Bogotá Wine and Food Festival . Leonor Espinosa has been exploring rural Colombian flavors for a decade at her upscale restaurant Leo Cocina y Cava but in late 2014 she opened the less pricey Misia a fresh take on traditional snack spots in a space decorated with clay tiles and recycled .

" WASHINGTON — President Trump is barreling into a confrontation with the courts barely two weeks after taking office foreshadowing years of legal battles as an administration determined to disrupt the existing order presses the boundaries of executive power . Lawyers for the administration were ordered to submit a brief on Monday defending Mr. Trump ’s order temporarily banning refugees from around the world and all visitors from seven predominantly Muslim countries from entering the United States . An appeals court in California refused on Sunday to reinstate the ban after a lower court blocked it . As people from the countries targeted by Mr. Trump struggled to make their way to the United States while they could the president for the second day in a row expressed rage at the judge in the case this time accusing him of endangering national security . Vice President Mike Pence defended the president ’s tone but lawyers and lawmakers of both parties said Mr. Trump ’s comments reflected a lack of respect for the constitutional system of checks and balances . Late in the day Mr. Trump took to Twitter to blame the judge and the judiciary for what the president suggested would be a future terrorist attack . “ Just cannot believe a judge would put our country in such peril ” Mr. Trump wrote a day after referring to the “ judge ” in the case . “ If something happens blame him and court system . ” Even before the latest post Republicans joined Democrats in chiding him . Senator Mitch McConnell of Kentucky the majority leader said it was “ best not to single out judges . ” “ We all get disappointed from time to time ” he said on CNN ’s “ State of the Union . ” “ I think it is best to avoid criticizing judges individually . ” The White House offered no evidence for Mr. Trump ’s suggestion that potential terrorists would now pour over the border because of the judge ’s order . Since Sept. 112001 no American has been killed in a terrorist attack on American soil by anyone who immigrated from any of the seven countries named in Mr. Trump ’s order . The impassioned debate over the immigration order brought to the fore issues at the heart of the Trump presidency . A businessman with no experience in public office Mr. Trump has shown in his administration ’s opening days that he favors an approach with little regard for the two other branches of government . While Congress controlled by Republicans has deferred the judiciary may emerge as the major obstacle for Mr. Trump . Democrats and some Republicans said Mr. Trump ’s attack on the courts would color the battle over the nomination of Judge Neil M. Gorsuch to the Supreme Court as well as the president ’s relationship with Congress . Other presidents have clashed with the judiciary . The Supreme Court invalidated parts of Franklin D. Roosevelt ’s New Deal forced Richard M. Nixon to turn over Watergate tapes and rejected Bill Clinton ’s bid to delay a sexual harassment lawsuit . The last two presidents battled with courts repeatedly over the limits of their power . The judiciary ruled that George W. Bush overstepped his bounds in denying due process to terrorism suspects and that Barack Obama assumed power he did not have to allow millions of unauthorized immigrants to stay in the country .

" A group of prominent Democrats who served in recent administrations including John Kerry and Madeleine K. Albright have called on the courts to extend a ruling blocking crucial parts of President Trump ’s travel ban saying the White House executive order would “ endanger U. S. troops ” and disrupt antiterrorism efforts . The former officials expressed their concerns on Monday to the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit based in San Francisco which is considering the matter after a judge in Seattle effectively ruled that travelers from seven predominantly Muslim nations as well as vetted refugees from all nations could for now continue to enter the United States . With Mr. Trump ’s executive order “ we risk placing our military efforts at risk by sending an insulting message ” to Iraqis working with American forces battling the Islamic State there the legal filing to the court said . “ The order will likely feed the recruitment narrative of ISIL and other extremists that portray the United States as at war with Islam ” it said using another name for the Islamic State also known as ISIS . In addition to Mr. Kerry a secretary of state under President Barack Obama and Ms. Albright who held the same position under President Bill Clinton officials behind the filing included Susan E. Rice Mr. Obama ’s national security adviser and Leon E. Panetta who served as secretary of defense and head of the C. I. A. The filing comes a week after Mr. Obama took issue with Mr. Trump ’s order saying in a statement that he “ fundamentally disagrees with the notion of discriminating against individuals because of their faith or religion . ” The former officials hope that adding their voice to the debate from a national security perspective undercuts a critical argument of the Trump administration : that the travel ban is meant to deter terrorist attacks by keeping the country safe from “ very bad and dangerous people
" At a sweltering refugee camp on the border dozens of Somalis who had cleared all the final security and medical checks to enter the United States were told to prepare themselves for a flight to a new life . In Pittsburgh a medical student from Iran finally got back to school after a chaotic journey that left him sleeping on a chair for four days . Inside Terminal 4 at Kennedy International Airport in New York a boy sprinted across the arrivals hall to embrace a family friend who had finally made it back to the United States after being marooned for a week in his home country Sudan . With the door open again for travelers and refugees who had been excluded by President Trump ’s order on immigration the race to reach the United States accelerated on Sunday among waves of people fearing the opportunity might be fleeting . The rush inundated some domestic and international airports reunited loved ones and friends and prompted another round of criticism from Mr. Trump that national security was being endangered by court orders that blocked his tight border policy from taking effect . Mr. Trump and his aides have suggested that terrorists and others who wish to do harm to the United States could arrive through normal immigration channels and that the administration needs time to tighten its vetting procedures . Those travelers now being admitted to the United States from seven predominantly Muslim nations singled out for a temporary ban by Mr. Trump had already been granted visas after screening . Refugees from those countries and elsewhere who were rushing to reach the United States had likewise already been vetted even more extensively in a process that involves dozens of checks and can take more than two years . But it was unclear whether a court order blocking Mr. Trump ’s policy from taking effect issued by a federal judge in Seattle would remain in place for long creating a sense of urgency among those trying to reach the United States . The back and forth had sown confusion anxiety fear and disbelief but the court order created “ a temporary window that we wish to take advantage of ” said Leonard Doyle a spokesman for the International Organization for Migration an intergovernmental agency that facilitates refugee resettlement . “ Our staff are being told to move like crazy . ” Families and immigration advocacy groups were buoyed twice over the weekend — first when the Seattle judge temporarily blocked the executive order and again when the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit in San Francisco denied the government ’s attempt to gain an emergency stay . But a mood of uncertainty persisted after a week in which thousands of travelers bound for the United States were halted in transit and turned away at airports and courts across the country issued conflicting rulings over whether and how the executive order should be carried out . Mr. Trump reacted angrily on Sunday . In a Twitter post
" WEST PALM BEACH Fla . — President Trump said in an interview that aired on Sunday that a replacement health care law was not likely to be ready until either the end of this year or in 2018 a major shift from promises by both him and Republican leaders to repeal and replace the law as soon as possible . “ Maybe it ’ll take till sometime into next year but we ’re certainly going to be in the process ” Mr. Trump said during an interview with Bill O’Reilly of Fox News after Mr. O’Reilly asked the president whether Americans could “ expect a new health care plan rolled out by the Trump administration this year . ” “ It statutorily takes awhile to get ” Mr. Trump said . “ We ’re going to be putting it in fairly soon I think that yes I would like to say by the end of the year at least the rudiments but we should have something within the year and the following year . ” Mr. Trump acknowledged that replacing former President Barack Obama ’s Affordable Care Act is complicated though he reiterated his confidence that his administration could devise a plan that would work better than the law — despite having provided few details of how such a plan would work . “ You have to remember Obamacare doesn ’t work so we are putting in a wonderful plan ” Mr. Trump said . Speaker Paul D. Ryan has vowed to move legislation for a replacement for the Affordable Care Act by the end of March . But some Republicans are worried about a political backlash if they repeal the law without an adequate replacement — potentially throwing millions of people off their insurance — and have urged a more methodical approach . Senator Lamar Alexander of Tennessee a Republican who is the chairman of the Senate Committee on Health Education Labor and Pensions recently proposed repairing parts of the health care law ahead of scrapping the whole package . Mr. Trump said last month that he wanted to present a replacement soon after the Senate confirmed his nominee for secretary of health and human services Representative Tom Price Republican of Georgia . The Senate is scheduled to vote on Mr. Price ’s confirmation this week . “ We ’re going to be submitting as soon as our secretary is approved almost simultaneously
" PALM BEACH Fla . — The news broke just as the fireworks began crackling over the grand estate ’s manicured lawn a festive backdrop for the guests sipping champagne around an ornamental pool : The White House had moved to appeal a court ruling that blocked President Trump ’s sweeping immigration order . At airports around the world the legal tug of war played out in starkly human terms with travelers from seven predominantly Muslim countries having to decide whether to board flights to the United States unsure of whether they would be turned back once they landed . Yet here in the cosseted confines of those concerns seemed a million miles away . The guests had gathered for the 60th annual Red Cross ball a staple of the Palm Beach social calendar which this year carried the theme “ From Vienna to Versailles . ” In keeping with the Hapsburg and Bourbon motif the male staff members wore powdered wigs and breeches the women were costumed in flouncy gowns and beehive wigs in the style of Marie Antoinette the queen guillotined in the French Revolution . The disconnect between high society and huddled masses would have been complete if not for the fact that ’s proprietor — the guest of honor that evening though he had to stand in line with his wife to get into his own ballroom — was the very person who had signed the immigration order and had gone to court to preserve it : Mr. Trump . “ We ’ll win ” the president said to a reporter on duty who asked him whether he was confident of the government ’s legal appeal . “ For the safety of the country we ’ll win . ” When another reporter asked whether he would abide by the federal court ’s ruling Mr. Trump smiled thinly but did not answer shifting from foot to foot as the first lady Melania Trump resplendent in a pink evening gown and diamond and emerald earrings

" President Trump ’s vow to overhaul the Food and Drug Administration could bring major changes in policy including steps to accelerate the process of approving new prescription drugs setting up a clash with critics who say his push for deregulation might put consumers at risk . Mr. Trump has been vetting candidates to run the agency which regulates the safety of everything from drugs and medical devices to food and cosmetics . Among them is Jim O’Neill a former official at the Health and Human Services Department who is an associate of the Silicon Valley billionaire and Trump supporter Peter Thiel . Mr. O’Neill has argued that companies should not have to prove that their drugs work in clinical trials before selling them to consumers . Other candidates also have called for reducing regulatory hurdles . If the most significant proposals are adopted — and many would require an act of Congress — they will reverse decades of policy and consumer protections dating to the 1960 s . Congress toughened the drug approval process in the wake of the worldwide crisis over thalidomide which caused severe birth defects in babies whose mothers had taken the drug in pregnancy . Since then the F. D. A. has come to be viewed as the world ’s leading watchdog for protecting the safety of food and drugs a gold standard whose lead other countries often follow . Mr. Trump ’s most recent statements made at a White House discussion last week with leaders of the nation ’s top drug companies have reverberated throughout the medical and pharmaceutical industries . Supporters of deregulation have long wanted to reduce bureaucracy and lessen oversight of drugs and devices while critics say the market for drugs could be destabilized and the door opened to unproven products based on junk science . “ Everyone depends on the agency from the drugs in our medicine cabinet to the food on our dinner table to our blood supplies ” said Dr. David Kessler who was commissioner of the F. D. A. during the presidencies of the elder George Bush and Bill Clinton . “ We are the envy of the world because our honey is our honey . Our foods are not laced with pesticides . Our drugs work . ” Mr. Trump said at the meeting that he was close to naming a “ fantastic ” person to lead the agency . In addition to Mr. O’Neill candidates whose names have recently surfaced include Dr. Scott Gottlieb a former F. D. A. official with longstanding ties to pharmaceutical and biotech companies and Dr. Joseph Gulfo a former biotech and medical device executive . All three have called for streamlining the drug approval process but Mr. O’Neill ’s stance has drawn the most attention . He is a managing director of Mithril Capital Management an investment firm Mr. Thiel and previously led the Thiel Foundation
2.0"President Trump asked by an interviewer on Saturday why he respected President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia even though he is “ a killer ” seemed to equate Mr. Putin ’s actions with those of the United States . “ You got a lot of killers ” he told the interviewer Bill O’Reilly of Fox News . “ What you think our country ’s so innocent ? ” Mr. Trump has long expressed his admiration for the Russian leader ’s strength . But his willingness to seemingly draw a moral equivalence to actions by Mr. Putin who has brutally suppressed dissent by eliminating political enemies led to an eruption on social media . Many asked how conservatives would have reacted had President Barack Obama or other Democrats compared American actions to Mr. Putin’s . The exchange surfaced on Saturday night in an excerpt from the interview which is to be broadcast on Sunday before the Super Bowl . What Mr. Trump was specifically referring to or whether there was added context that came after his comment was not immediately clear based on the excerpt that was made available . In the interview Mr. Trump was asked if he respected Mr. Putin . He said he did adding that he respected “ a lot of people but that doesn ’t mean I ’m going to get along with him . ” Mr. Trump continued : “ He ’s a leader of his country . I say it ’s better to get along with Russia than not . And if Russia helps us in the fight against ISIS — which is a major fight — and Islamic terrorism all over the world — major fight — that ’s a good thing . Will I get along with him ? I have no idea . It ’s very possible that I won’t . ” Mr. Trump ’s campaign pledge to mend ties with Moscow has raised questions over his administration ’s commitment to maintaining sanctions against Russia for its involvement in the fighting and annexation of Crimea from Ukraine . He said he was willing to work with Kiev and Moscow to resolve a separatist conflict in eastern Ukraine after a telephone call on Saturday with President Petro O. Poroshenko of Ukraine Reuters reported . The call was the first direct contact between the two leaders since Mr. Trump ’s inauguration . “ We will work with Ukraine Russia and all other parties involved to help them restore peace along the border ” Mr. Trump said in a White House statement . His comments contrasted with those of Nikki R. Haley the new American ambassador to the United Nations
" The diplomatic travails of President Trump and his past Twitter fixation with Kristen Stewart provided plenty of fodder for “ Saturday Night Live ” this weekend . But a sketch lampooning Sean M. Spicer the White House press secretary in which he was impersonated by Melissa McCarthy the comic actress and a surprise guest star stole the show as “ S. N. L. ” continued to take swings at a president who delights in hitting back . In the show ’s cold open Alec Baldwin returned for another outing as Mr. Trump phoning up other world leaders under the guidance of chief strategist Stephen K. Bannon ( actually an “ S. N. L. ” cast member dressed as the Grim Reaper ) . As Mr. Trump Mr. Baldwin first called Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull of Australia ( Beck Bennett ) who reminded him that President Barack Obama promised to receive 1200 refugees held in detention in Australia . “ No refugees ” Mr. Baldwin said hastily . “ America first Australia sucks . Your reef is failing . Prepare to go to war . ” He went on to call President Enrique Peña Nieto of Mexico ( “ Guy who ’s going to pay for the wall says what ? ” ) Chancellor Angela Merkel of Germany ( “ I ’m going to write a memoir about this struggle and call it ‘ My Struggle ’ — what would that be in German ? ” ) and President Robert Mugabe of Zimbabwe . Mr. Mugabe ( Kenan Thompson ) was not impressed or intimidated : “ I will rip out your spine and drink from your skull ” he told Mr. Baldwin . In her opening monologue Ms. Stewart the show ’s host recalled a period in 2012 when Mr. Trump posted several tweets about the relationship she had with her “ Twilight ” Robert Pattinson . ( In one tweet Mr. Trump wrote that Ms. Stewart “ cheated on him like a dog will do it again ” and in another he invited Mr. Pattinson to attend the Miss Universe pageant . ) “ To be fair ” Ms. Stewart said “ I don ’t think Donald Trump hated me . I think he ’s in love with my boyfriend . ” She added “ The president is not a huge fan of me . But that is so O. K. And Donald
" While many Super Bowl advertisers chose to be silly or sentimental with their commercials on Sunday it was the few that ventured — or appeared to venture — into political territory that attracted the most attention . Among the major brands that used their commercial time for social commentary was Airbnb which had decided just last week to run an ad . In the ad the company promoted its view of an open multicultural world reflecting its commitment to housing refugees . revived an ad it ran during the 2014 Super Bowl featuring people singing a multilingual version of “ America the Beautiful . ” It managed to strike a new chord with viewers given the recent national conversation around immigration and diversity and it prompted a flood of conversation on Twitter . “ I thought it was great for Coke to air an old ad because today it feels even more relevant than it did in 2014 when they first aired it ” said Lynn Power chief executive of J. Walter Thompson New York . It was a smart move from the brand to an old message she added given that “ you can ’t say it ’s a reactionary thing . ” In an interview before halftime during the game Rob Schwartz chief executive of TBWA’’Chiat’’Day New York said “ If there ’s anything that ’s screaming out here it ’s diversity . ” He added : “ People are saying ‘ Is this trolling Trump ? ’ I don ’t think it ’s trolling . It ’s a big smack in the face of ‘ dude this is America . ’ ” Still for the most part
" HOUSTON — There was the game on the field and there was the one watched through the political prism of these times . On social media the Atlanta Falcons were not just the N. F. C. champions they were for ferment coming from a staunchly Democratic city and facing a Patriots team whose owner head coach and starting quarterback are all friends with the president to varying degrees . “ Falcons are fun and their biggest stars aren ’t pro Trump ” JayZito wrote on Twitter . “ I ’m a Falcons fan today . ” Not long before the game started President Trump in an interview on Fox which was broadcasting the game predicted a Patriot win by 8 points in part out of support for his friends . That prediction was the object of ridicule as Atlanta surged ahead but then it ended up appearing prescient as the Patriots stormed back to win in the first Super Bowl overtime . Mr. Trump did not attend the game opting for a traditional party near his vacation home in South Florida . ( Social media users dissected a picture of Mr. Trump and his family not looking enthusiastic at a table there and took sometimes harsh note of Mr. Trump ’s departure with nearly an hour and a half left in the game . ) Vice President Mike Pence attended the game and drew some boos when he was shown on a stadium screen talking with James Baker who served as secretary of state under former President George Bush . Mr. Bush did the opening coin toss from a wheelchair on the field accompanied by the former first lady Barbara Bush . A succession of commercials with themes of inclusion immigration and multiculturalism were seen by many viewers as commentary on Trump ’s executive orders restricting immigration and his calls for a wall along the Mexican border . One commercial made by follows the path of one of the company ’s Adolphus Busch as he immigrated from Germany to the United States . The ad was criticized by some commentators who created a hashtag #BoycottBudweiser . The actor Morgan Freeman appeared in a commercial for Turkish Airlines

" Editor ’s note : We ’re resurfacing this Eat column from last year for Smarter Living to give you some ideas for using up any leftover holiday wine . It is a new year . We have resolved and a popular fixture in our resolutions is booze . We used it well : It went into punch . It went into grog . It went into mulled wine cocktails and eggnog . It went straight in . It began in a trickle that became a geyser . Now we are pickled . Which is why January though a poor time for drinking alcohol is a good time for cooking with it . In particular with wine — which is in the elegant and spiritually stirring formulation of Robert Farrar Capon the late Episcopal priest and cookbook author ‘ ‘ water that has matured according to nature ’s will . ’ ’ Recipes using wine are notably less common today than they were half a century ago when every fondue pot and chafing dish released rich gusts of boozy vapor . But there is little better use for the thousands of bottles that litter refrigerators and counters than to help them effect a secular transubstantiation in our dinners . The alcohol in wine evaporates more quickly than water and is mostly gone after 30 minutes ’ cooking . What is left is the taste of the grape that made it among dozens of ghost flavors : cherry violet ash pineapple fresh leather apple black pepper wet soil mandarin lilac or rose . Plus a light acidity that keeps the palate alive and alert
" MONROVIA Liberia — Emmanuel Dongo who spends his days begging on Monrovia ’s streets plunged with his crutches onto the concrete stage and into the glare of neon . He thrust his muscular shoulders forward limp legs hanging behind him and transformed himself into Lyrical D rising rap artist . “ Handicap man trying to survive then you sitting there just to criticize when that you what thing you will really do ? ” he asked snapping out the lyrics to a rapt crowd at Code 146 where Liberia ’s aspiring rap stars come to make their names . “ Will you close your mouth and turn your back on you ? I feel too bad when I sitting in this wheelchair just want to be walking like you man . See me passing and you mocking at me telling me I not even look like human being . ” Putting down his crutches Mr. Dongo leaned back into his wheelchair and propelled himself across the stage dancing frenetically and spitting out angry rhymes about his experiences of discrimination in a society that largely views disability through the lens of superstition . Even though disabled victims of war are a common sight on Liberia ’s city streets handicapped people are often seen as cursed their amputations or paralyzed limbs viewed as the result of witchcraft by the cruel and envious or else as punishment for some wrongdoing . Music seems an unlikely career choice for a Liberian with Mr. Dongo ’s many difficulties . But the proliferation of makeshift studios engineers and a distinct Liberian sound has given rise to a thriving music scene here
" Mary McCormack Hughes has a vivid recollection of the phone call she got 35 years ago this week from Robert Durst her . “ Have you seen Kathie ? ” he asked . Kathie was Kathleen Durst Ms. Hughes ’s younger sister who at 29 was in the final months of medical school . Her marriage to Mr. Durst the eccentric scion of a prominent New York real estate family had splintered under Mr. Durst ’s efforts to control her repeated rounds of quarreling and finally violence . No Ms. Hughes said she had responded but I ’ve been meaning to talk to you about Kathie . Mr. Durst cut her off saying he was going to the police and abruptly ended the call she said .

2.0"BIRMINGHAM England — On Saturday night at the Genting Arena here a billowing white curtain whipped up and into the ceiling to reveal the singer Ozzy Osbourne who for perhaps the last time ever as the frontman of Black Sabbath plunged into the 1970 song that gave the band its name . The track kicked off the final concert on a tour called “ The End ” which the band has billed as its last performances . After 49 years the group — which formed here in 1968 and has had dramatic ups and downs and a rotating roster of members — finally threw in the towel with a hometown concert . “ Let ’s go crazy ” Mr. Osbourne yelled to the crowd adding an expletive early in the concert before turning in thrashing renditions of the band ’s songs including “ War Pigs ” “ Into the Void ” and “ Iron Man ” and deeper cuts like the instrumental “ Rat Salad . ” Fans and members of the news media were buzzing before the concert with rumors of possible antics and surprises — perhaps even an appearance by the original drummer Bill Ward estranged from the group since 2012 . But Black Sabbath played it straight turning in almost two hours of its earliest 1960 s and ’70s songs pretty much unadulterated ( but of course
" Returning home on Saturday night after a dinner in Manhattan with some longtime friends Gregory Locke boarded a No. 1 subway train and was confronted with an ugly sight . The car ’s windows and posters were covered in graffiti according to accounts from Mr. Locke and another passenger in the car Jared Nied . Messages like “ Jews belong in the oven ” and “ destroy Israel Heil Hitler ” had been written over subway maps as shown by photographs taken on the train . Swastikas were drawn in black marker on the doors and windows . Mr. Locke 27 a New York lawyer said in a phone interview that his first reaction was shock “ especially once I realized how many instances of graffiti were on the train car . ” “ But the shock quickly subsides and turns into a sort of a realistic horror ” he said . “ You realize it ’s appalling but it ’s also not surprising at the same time . ” Neither man reported the graffiti to the police and neither the New York Police Department nor the Metropolitan Transportation Authority had a record of any report . Mr. Nied 36 was returning home from his work as a around 7 p. m. and boarded the train at 42nd Street . He said in a phone interview that his reaction to the graffiti which he noticed immediately must have been written on his face and he soon attracted the attention of another commuter . “ There was a lady sitting across from me under the map and she said ‘ Oh that ’s absolutely horrible
" NICOSIA Cyprus — As the United Nations geared up for negotiations that it declared the “ best and last chance ” to unite Cyprus after more than four decades of acrimonious division Russia ’s ambassador attended a seminar dedicated to derailing any prospect of an agreement between Greek and Turkish Cypriots . The presence of the ambassador Stanislav Osadchiy delighted Greek Cypriot politicians in Nicosia the capital of the south of the divided island . They had helped torpedo a 2004 reunification plan supported by the United States and have now rallied together to defeat a new push for a settlement that began on Jan. 12 with an international conference in Geneva . But Mr. Osadchiy ’s attendance at the seminar which Western and other diplomats shunned angered Nicos Anastasiades the president of the Republic of Cyprus and a strong supporter of efforts to resolve an interethnic dispute as intractable and nearly as protracted as the conflict . In an interview in Nicosia Mr. Anastasiades said that when questioned the ambassador had apologized and said he had misunderstood the nature of the seminar despite its clear agenda and the fact that it had been organized by five small political parties all bitterly opposed to a compromise deal in Geneva . The president said he accepted the ambassador ’s explanation and his insistence that he had not meant to endorse the rejectionists by attending . But Mr. Anastasiades added “ I consider any intervention by any third country as not what we are looking for . ” Like countless previous diplomatic efforts to reunite Cyprus since Turkey invaded in 1974 and split the country in two the recent Geneva talks failed to achieve a breakthrough though they did make some progress . Mr. Anastasiades said the two sides were “ halfway ” to an agreement but still had deep divisions notably on the issue of whether Turkey Greece and Britain the former colonial master should retain their status as “ guarantors ” of the island ’s security
" ISTANBUL — Several hundred people suspected of being Islamic State operatives were arrested in a series of coordinated raids by the Turkish police on Sunday in what constitutes one of Turkey ’s largest operations against the jihadist group on the country ’s soil . Nearly 450 suspects were rounded up in the early hours of Sunday according to the Anadolu Agency a news wire . Independent television reports later said 690 suspects had been held by the end of the day . At least one attack was said to have been thwarted in the process according to Anadolu . The operation was distinct from crackdowns on those accused of being supporters of last summer ’s failed coup and on members of the country ’s political opposition . More than 130000 Turks have been arrested or fired from government posts in the past seven months as part of those efforts according to government data . Sunday ’s raids were the latest salvo in a conflict between Turkey and the Islamic State also known as ISIS or ISIL . In the early years of the Syrian revolution Turkey was accused of turning a blind eye to the movement of thousands of Islamic State fighters over its southern border with Syria where they joined the war against the forces of the Syrian president Bashar . But the Turkish Army is now in direct conflict with the group in northern Syria where Turkey is leading attempts to expel the Islamic State from the strategically important city of Al Bab . Turkey has suffered numerous attacks linked to the Islamic State since 2014 most recently in the early hours of this year when a fighter killed 39 people at a nightclub in Istanbul Turkey ’s largest city . The group is also believed to be behind an October 2015 bombing in Ankara Turkey ’s capital that killed more than 100 people and was accused of organizing the killing of 45 people at Istanbul ’s main airport last summer . This weekend ’s raids occurred across an unusually wide area with suspects seized in 18 provinces . The move is a change in strategy by the Turkish police who have usually detained only small numbers of jihadists at a time
2.0"David Shepard a film preservationist who restored hundreds of discarded hidden or forgotten films by masters like Charlie Chaplin Buster Keaton and F. W. Murnau and packaged rarities for the consumer market died on Jan. 31 in Medford Ore . He was 76 . The cause was cancer said his brother Donald . The era of Valentino and Fairbanks had been over for decades when Mr. Shepard barely in his teens began buying old films reel by reel with money earned from his paper route . He had been bitten by the bug when his uncle Myron a photographer in the Signal Corps brought home a projector and a boxful of films from France after World War II — abridged versions of Fritz Lang ’s “ Metropolis ” and Georges Méliès ’s experimental “ A Trip to the Moon ” among others . They kindled an enthusiasm that only grew with time . Working for the American Film Institute and later for Blackhawk Films which reproduced old films for the collectors ’ market Mr. Shepard began searching out movies that had been languishing in studio vaults or private collections and bringing them in for restoration . By trial and error he developed techniques now used widely in commercial preservation laboratories . In 1989 after acquiring Blackhawk ’s library
" LYON France — The French leader Marine Le Pen delivered a grim populist kickoff to her burgeoning presidential campaign on Sunday warning thousands of her supporters of “ two totalitarianisms ” globalization and Islamism that want to “ subjugate France . ” Ms. Le Pen ’s dark picture of a weakened France troubled by bureaucrats and burqas was a striking echo of themes being sounded across the Atlantic . France a prosperous country with the world ’s economy was depicted as a besieged wreck . In a packed hall here she made a point in an hourlong speech brimming with nationalist fervor of praising President Trump and the Americans who had elected him as her supporters shouted forcefully “ This is our country ! ” Americans she said had “ kept faith with their national interest ” even as she promised to do the same for France saying the French had been “ dispossessed of their patriotism . ” Whether it will sell in a country undoubtedly frightened by terrorism and weary of unemployment hovering around 10 percent is unclear but it is certain that Ms. Le Pen ’s National Front party is closer than it has ever been to gaining power in France after over 40 years of existence . Polls show that she is very likely to reach at least a second round of voting in France ’s electoral process this spring . The weekend ’s campaigning in this prosperous southeastern metropolis — her likely runoff opponent Emmanuel Macron the centrist former economy minister also drew thousands to a rally across town on Saturday — offered a taste of the fierce electoral battle to come and a rerun of some of the American election ’s dynamic . The populist Ms. Le Pen 48
2.0"Emmanuelle Riva whose performance in the antiwar film “ Hiroshima Mon Amour ” in 1959 placed her at the center of the French New Wave — and who more than 50 years later became the oldest person nominated for an Academy Award for best lead actor or actress as a woman debilitated by strokes in “ Amour ” — died on Friday in Paris . She was 89 . The cause was cancer her agent Anne Alvares Correa said . “ Hiroshima Mon Amour ” directed by Alain Resnais and written by Marguerite Duras was one of the first internationally acclaimed films to emerge from the French New Wave a movement that rejected classic cinematic storytelling with youthful irreverence . In the United States it was an hit . “ With his first feature film ” Andrew Sarris wrote in The Village Voice “ Resnais has made the most important contribution to realizable film aesthetics since ‘ Citizen Kane . ’ ” The movie opens with Ms. Riva playing an actress who has come to Hiroshima to make a film promoting peace and her Eiji Okada as an architect in a lovers ’ embrace . Their faces are unseen and their limbs are covered in what appears to be ash as if from a nuclear blast that is then washed away . They speak in . Ms. Riva says she has seen evidence of the bomb ’s effects in a hospital and a museum . But Mr. Okada rebukes her
" Iran will bar the United States wrestling team from a major international meet this month in response to President Trump ’s order severely limiting travel from several countries including Iran . Bahram Qasemi the Iranian Foreign Ministry spokesman announced the decision Friday morning the Islamic Republic News Agency reported . The agency reported that the decision had been made by “ a special committee which opposed to presence of the team after necessary studies . ” Mr. Qasemi said the ministry opposed the Americans ’ participation because of Mr. Trump ’s order . “ We ’re in talks about it right at the moment ” said Christina Kelley the chief international ambassador for U. S. A. Wrestling . “ We ’re pretty devastated . ” A U. S. A. Wrestling statement while noting that the group had not received official confirmation of the decision said : “ If these reports are true U. S. A. Wrestling is extremely disappointed about this which we believe would be an unacceptable situation . Wrestling is about competition and good will through sport and is no place for politics . ” The event the Freestyle World Cup is scheduled for Feb. 16 and 17 in Kermanshah Iran . Held annually it pits the best wrestlers in the world in team competition . Last year the event was held in Los Angeles and it is scheduled to be held in Iowa City in 2018 . Iran has won the event five years in a row . Americans and Iranians regularly wrestle in each other ’s countries with few problems if any . Wrestling is one of the most popular sports in Iran : 43 of the nation ’s 69 Olympic medals have come in wrestling . The United States and Iran worked together in 2013 to persuade the International Olympic Committee to keep wrestling in the Summer Games when it was threatened with removal . There is an international wrestling meet scheduled for May in Times Square
" “ An idea is a good thing ” Ken Downing the fashion director of Neiman Marcus said on Tuesday as he bolted in his biker jacket and skinny jeans from one show to another . “ But a theme can scare me running away . ” Despite everyone ’s best efforts to shut out the world beyond New York Fashion Week : Men ’s a unifying theme emerged : the parlous state of current politics . It didn ’t matter that the visitors to the Skylight Clarkson North event space in Lower Manhattan where most of the shows were held tried to drink away their worries at the cozy VIP Amazon Lounge or escaped into chatter about Alejandro Gómez Palomo a young Spanish designer who shocked the front row with a show featuring men in frilly frocks or talked about the head of Ralph Lauren being unceremoniously shoved into the oubliette . Of the dozens of designers interviewed during a marathon that ended on Thursday not one failed to volunteer some expression of concern anxiety perplexity or stark anger about the barrage of executive orders tweets and statements recently issued from the White House . “ It ’s hitting people like a dagger in the heart ” the designer John Varvatos said moments before his best men ’s wear show in years at the Diamond Horseshoe nightclub in Midtown . Mr. Varvatos was referring to President Trump ’s order banning the entry of citizens from seven nations and refugees from any country . “ People are in disbelief ” Mr. Varvatos said . “ Half the people in my company are from someplace else . ” So it would seem are half the personnel in the industry . Consider the major designers anchoring a men ’s wear fashion week now in its fourth iteration and gaining strength in terms of its offerings and the breadth of representation . Mr. Varvatos for example is a American whose parents migrated from Greece and settled in Detroit . The Ralph Lauren is the son of Askhenazi Jewish immigrants from Belarus . Raised in South Boston Joseph Abboud was born in the United States to Maronite Christian parents who
" CEDARHURST N. Y. — On a brisk October day Laura Gentile strolled through the orderly aisles stocked with matzo ball soup apple juice challah and cinnamon kokosh cake . Packing her cart with fresh peppers canned tuna pretzels and cake she said the food pantry here on Long Island was the first where she felt like any other grocery shopper . It was welcome relief from the long lines and piles of unorganized food at other food banks . “ You don ’t feel destroyed just walking in ” Ms. Gentile 45 said . “ Renee greets you when you come in and you can pick out what you want what you need . You ’re not just handed something . ” Renee Harris the food pantry coordinator said she knew from experience the importance of creating a welcoming environment . When her husband lost his job in 2009 she found herself shopping at food banks for the first time in her life . “ I felt the employees watching me — like I might try to steal something ” Ms. Harris said . “ And I ran out of the store crying . ” Then one day she stopped by the Rina Shkolnik Kosher Food Pantry . When her family got back on its feet a few years later Ms. Harris started working there hoping to replicate her experience for the 350 families who shop at the pantry each month . Emulating a traditional grocery store the food bank is organized by food groups . Shoppers carry items home in marked bags donated by nearby shops . Ms. Gentile receives $ 182 a month in food stamps to feed herself a son
" WASHINGTON — The Justice Department on Monday evening urged a federal appeals court to reinstate President Trump ’s targeted travel ban saying immediate action was needed to ensure the nation ’s safety . The administration ’s brief was the last in a series of urgent pleas to the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit in San Francisco which is now set to rule on the most ambitious and disruptive initiative of Mr. Trump ’s young presidency . The ruling will almost certainly be followed by an appeal to the Supreme Court . The court scheduled an hourlong oral argument for Tuesday . That gives at least another day of reprieve to foreign visitors from seven predominantly Muslim countries as well as other immigrants who initially were blocked from entering the United States by Mr. Trump ’s order . The administration ’s brief largely tracked its earlier arguments that dismissing the ban outright would threaten national security and disregard presidential authority . But it also asked the appeals court at a minimum to reinstate at least part of Mr. Trump ’s order — appearing to acknowledge the possibility that the government ’s case might not be successful . “ At most ” the brief said the court order blocking the ban should be limited to “ previously admitted aliens who are temporarily abroad now or who wish to travel and return to the United States in the future . ” That would allow the federal government to block people who have never visited the United States . On Monday Sean Spicer the White House press secretary said the administration stood ready to reinstate the entire ban . “ Once we win the case it will go right back into action ” he said . Later on Monday night Mr. Trump called threats “ from radical Islamic terrorism is very real . ” “ Courts must act fast ! ” Mr. Trump said on Twitter . Trial judges around the country have blocked aspects of Mr. Trump ’s executive order which suspended travel from the seven countries and limited the nation ’s refugee program but none of those cases have reached an appeals court . And none of the rulings were as broad as the one under review in the case State of Washington v. Trump . The Ninth Circuit scheduled the oral argument in the case for Tuesday at 3 p. m. Pacific time . It is to take place by telephone and the court said it would be on its website . Holding an oral argument by telephone in a major case is unusual . The case will be heard by Judge William C. Canby Jr . appointed by President Jimmy Carter Judge Michelle T. Friedland appointed by President Barack Obama and Judge Richard R. Clifton
" WASHINGTON — President Trump loves to set the day ’s narrative at dawn but the deeper story of his White House is best told at night . Aides confer in the dark because they cannot figure out how to operate the light switches in the cabinet room . Visitors conclude their meetings and then wander around testing doorknobs until finding one that leads to an exit . In a darkened mostly empty West Wing Mr. Trump ’s provocative chief strategist Stephen K. Bannon finishes another day planning new lines of attack . Usually around 6:30 p. m. or sometimes later Mr. Trump retires upstairs to the residence to recharge vent and intermittently use Twitter . With his wife Melania and young son Barron staying in New York he is almost always by himself sometimes in the protective presence of his imposing longtime aide and former security chief Keith Schiller . When Mr. Trump is not watching television in his bathrobe or on his phone reaching out to old campaign hands and advisers he will sometimes set off to explore the unfamiliar surroundings of his new home . During his first two dizzying weeks in office Mr. Trump an outsider president working with a surprisingly small crew of no more than a empowered aides with virtually no familiarity with the workings of the White House or federal government sent shock waves at home and overseas with a succession of executive orders designed to fulfill campaign promises and taunt foreign leaders . “ We are moving big and we are moving fast ” Mr. Bannon said
" WASHINGTON — President Trump ’s executive order on immigration has prompted a constitutional showdown that could leave a mark on the law for generations and seems likely to end in a landmark Supreme Court decision . A ruling by the court on Mr. Trump ’s travel ban on seven predominantly Muslim countries could help answer some crucial legal questions : How much independent constitutional authority does the president have over immigration and how much power has Congress given him ? The likely answer to both questions : a lot . But other parts of the Constitution may temper or defeat that power . Among them are the due process and equal protection clauses and the First Amendment ’s ban on government establishment of religion . Here is a look at the leading arguments in the case . Many trial judges around the country have blocked aspects of Mr. Trump ’s executive order . But none have issued an order as broad as the one by Judge James Robart a federal judge in Seattle who blocked the key parts of the executive order which had suspended travel from the seven countries and limited the nation ’s refugee program . The case is now before the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit in San Francisco . That court on Saturday declined to issue an immediate stay of Judge Robart ’s order but it indicated that it would weigh in soon after additional briefs were filed with the last one due Monday afternoon . After it rules an appeal to the Supreme Court seems likely . Judge Robart ’s brisk ruling contained almost no reasoning . By contrast Judge Nathaniel M. Gorton of the Federal District Court in Boston issued a decision on Friday refusing to block the program and discussing the legal arguments in detail . Judge Gorton also sketched out the broader picture . “ The rich immigrant history of the United States has long been a source of strength and pride in this country ” Judge Gorton wrote . “ Conversely the public interest in safety and security in this dangerous world is strong as well . ” The balance he wrote tipped in favor of Mr. Trump . Article II of the Constitution confers authority on the president the Supreme Court has said to conduct foreign affairs and address immigration . In their brief to Judge Robart lawyers for Washington State one of the two plaintiffs
" In late September a group of tech leaders started a effort to raise $ 100 000 for Hillary Clinton . In flush Silicon Valley that is spare change . But by the time the election was over the campaign had pulled in only $ 76 324 . For all its visceral dislike of Donald J. Trump the tech community did not worry too much about him being elected or once in office carrying through with his program . Lulled by favorable polls distracted by its own destiny Silicon Valley was above all else complacent . No longer . After President Trump ’s Jan. 27 executive order restricting immigration has gone political . Companies are being pushed by their employees by their customers and sometimes by their ideals . They are trying to go far enough without going too far . Nearly 130 companies most of them in the technology field filed an amicus brief late Sunday in the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit which declined to reinstate the travel ban after a lower court blocked it . The brief which was signed by an unusually broad coalition of large and small tech companies that included Apple Facebook Microsoft Google
" Michael Eisen an evolutionary biologist is among the elite of American scientists with a tenured position at the University of California Berkeley and generous funding from the Howard Hughes Medical Institute for his research on fruit flies . But late last month dismayed over the Trump administration ’s apparent disdain for evidence on climate change and other issues Dr. Eisen registered the Twitter handle @SenatorPhD and declared his intention to run in the 2018 election for a seat in the United States Senate from California . His campaign slogan : “ Liberty Equality Reality . ” “ I ’m not sure I ’m the best vehicle for this ” said Dr. Eisen whose professional attire consists of shorts and bearing mottos supporting open access to scientific literature a cause he has championed . “ But if we want to defend the role of science in policy making scientists need to run for office . ” Since Mr. Trump ’s election many other scientists have expressed concern about rumors and public statements on the new administration ’s views on science climate change and the role of federal offices like the Environmental Protection Agency . Mr. Trump has called climate change a hoax ( although more recently said he would have an “ open mind ” about it ) and appointed some officials to his transition team who dispute mainstream climate science . But there is much that is still unclear about his administration ’s attitudes toward science . The president has yet to appoint a science adviser and has not responded to open letters calling on him to do so from science policy groups including the American Association for the Advancement of Science ( whose president Rush D. Holt is a physicist and former congressman ) . Few scientists have gone as far as Dr. Eisen but other researchers are now undergoing a political awakening contemplating what their role should be for at least the next few years . “ There are many conversations going on right now
" There were so many instant internet spoofs making fun of Kellyanne Conway ’s “ Bowling Green Massacre ” that it ’s hard to pick a favorite . Gun to my head I ’d say mine was the Twitter meme that showed a brass plaque dedicated to the names of the poor souls left for dead on Bowling Green ’s grassy killing field . It was blank . That ’s because there was no massacre there . No one died . No one even stubbed a toe . But there ’s a good chance you know that by now : that the supposed terrorist attack in Bowling Green Ky . that Ms. Conway a top presidential adviser invoked on MSNBC last week to justify President Trump ’s contentious travel ban never happened . ( And no the reason you had never heard of it was not because the Dishonest Media ignored the alleged carnage at the time of its as Ms. Conway alleged . ) The very fact that you probably know all this means that the “ Bowling Green Massacre ” may go down in the record of the Trump presidency as the first break in the “ fake news ” clouds that have cast such gloom over our fair and once ( relatively ) true republic . The same internet that enabled false stories to run unchecked through news feeds during the election year dispatched new white blood cells that attacked Ms. Conway ’s “ alternate facts ” with “ true facts ” ( a redundant term that I guess we ’re stuck with for now ) . Their most effective attack was traditional reporting in many cases from news organizations that have doubled down on joined by newfangled memes that accentuate the truth . The Massacre That Wasn ’t showed that while Facebook Google and Twitter take steps to combat nefarious hoaxes they are already playing host to an organic correction movement led by ordinary users who are crowdsourcing reality . It ’s early . Vigilance and continuing improvements throughout the news business remain necessary . But the tale of the “ massacre ” could be the start of something new . Ms. Conway ’s mention of the supposed attack — she was trying to justify Mr. Trump ’s order that closed the border to citizens from seven predominately Muslim countries — slipped past the MSNBC host interviewing her Chris Matthews . The corrective story broke the way stories have broken since God invented newspapers : A guy walked into a bar . In this case the guy was Joe Sonka a staff writer for the Insider Louisville website . He was having a beer at a bar called the Backdoor when “ someone texted me that Conway said something insane ” Mr. Sonka told me . As a reporter — and onetime liberal blogger — in Kentucky for several years Mr. Sonka knew what Ms. Conway seemed to be referring to when he went home to check it out . In 2011 the federal authorities arrested two Iraqi refugees who were later given prison sentences — one for life and one for 40 years — for plotting to send money and weapons to Al Qaeda in Iraq from their new homes in Bowling Green . The episode led to a slowdown in Iraqi immigration as the Obama administration reworked vetting procedures . The authorities never charged the men — one of whose fingerprints turned up on a roadside bomb in Iraq — with planning an attack on American soil . So at 9:34 p. m. on Thursday Mr. Sonka wrote on Twitter : “ @KellyannePolls says that 2 Iraqi refugees ‘ were the masterminds behind the Bowling Green massacre . ’ ( There was no such massacre . ) ” It made like a Trump tweet and roared through the broader news media sphere . “ That tweet got 2. 4 million impressions ” Mr. Sonka said . “ Pretty crazy . ” There was fast by Vox
2.0"■ The White House press secretary Sean Spicer took aim on Monday afternoon at a New York Times story that described President Trump watching television in his bathrobe . ■ Opposition to Mr. Trump ’s travel restrictions on certain countries mounted but the president remained defiant and unbowed . ■ Mr. Trump turned to Twitter early Monday and began challenging polls that showed his travel order was not popular . ■ A bipartisan group of former National Security Council officials filed court documents opposing the ban . ■ The Justice Department corrected the record on how many people had their visas canceled because of the ban . Mr. Spicer denounced The Times ’s account published Sunday night of the president ’s turbulent adjustment to life in the White House . In particular he zeroed in on one detail among a few paragraphs of the story that he insisted were wrong : that the president has worn a bathrobe while alone in the White House residence . “ That is literally the epitome of fake news ” Mr. Spicer told reporters traveling with Mr. Trump . “ Start at the top . I don ’t think the president owns a bathrobe . He definitely doesn ’t wear one . ” The White House staff stocks the official residence with bathrobes . Within moments of Mr. Spicer ’s comment reporters on Twitter posted photos of a much younger Mr. Trump lounging in a bathrobe . Mr. Spicer added that the story was “ so riddled with inaccuracies and lies that they owe the president an apology . ” He went on “ Literally blatant factual errors and it ’s unacceptable to see that kind of reporting or reporting . ” The overall piece which described Mr. Trump ’s first two weeks in office as he attempts a dramatic of a Washington culture he has never inhabited was “ not an accurate portrayal of what ’s really happening ” Mr. Spicer concluded . Mr. Trump appeared not to like the news he was reading Monday morning . In one Twitter post the president rejected reports of polls showing that a majority of Americans oppose his travel order . In another he appeared to lash out at suggestions that Stephen K. Bannon his chief strategist holds the real power in the West Wing . A CNN poll released over the weekend said that 55 percent of Americans viewed Mr. Trump ’s travel order as an attempt to keep Muslims out of the country . The president also seemed angry about the story line

" Good morning . ( Want to get California Today by email ? Here ’s the . ) More than 1300 lives are cut short each year in the Los Angeles area because of air pollution scientists say . Now after years of work regulators are getting ready to adopt their most substantial plan in more than a decade to do something about it . The proposal is outlined in pages from the South Coast Air Quality Management District whose jurisdiction extends across Los Angeles Orange Riverside and San Bernardino Counties . Not surprisingly it has set off debate as critics have called the plan too lenient on industry . “ California has made clear that it intends to be a leader on environmental issues ” said Angela Johnson Meszaros a staff attorney with Earthjustice an environmental law group . “ And here we ’ve got the Los Angeles air agency not doing all that it can . ” All sides recognize that industries under the agency ’s regulatory power — including refineries ports and warehouses — must adopt cleaner technologies . The agreement breaks down over how to get there . The draft blueprint would adopt some tougher emissions rules . But it also calls for a carrot approach : roughly $ 15 billion in handouts over the next 15 years to encourage polluters to clean up . Some community leaders have portrayed the incentives — which would surely involve tax increases — as a form of corporate welfare at the expense of families . But supporters of the plan have argued that they are needed to avoid stifling business . Smaller operators for example may not be able to afford a new cleaner truck . “ Obviously you can ’t make everybody happy ” said Philip M. Fine deputy executive officer for the air district . “ But we think we ’ve developed a sensible comprehensive and regulatory approach . ” At a public meeting last Friday the air agency ’s board was supposed to vote on a final version of the plan . Hundreds of people showed up
" WASHINGTON — In his first days as President Trump ’s pick to lead the Federal Communications Commission Ajit Pai has aggressively moved to roll back consumer protection regulations created during the Obama presidency . Mr. Pai took a first swipe at net neutrality rules designed to ensure equal access to content on the internet . He stopped nine companies from providing discounted internet service to individuals . He withdrew an effort to keep prison phone rates down and he scrapped a proposal to break open the cable box market . In total as the chairman of the F. C. C. Mr. Pai released about a dozen actions in the last week many buried in the agency ’s website and not publicly announced stunning consumer advocacy groups and telecom analysts . They said Mr. Pai ’s message was clear : The F. C. C. an independent agency will mirror the Trump administration ’s rapid unwinding of government regulations that businesses fought against during the Obama administration . “ With these tactics Chairman Pai is showing his true stripes ” said Matt Wood the policy director at the consumer group Free Press . “ The public wants an F. C. C. that helps people ” he added . “ Instead it got one that does favors for the powerful corporations that its chairman used to work for . ” Mr. Pai a former lawyer for Verizon was elevated by Mr. Trump to the position of chairman after serving as a minority Republican member for the past three years . Known for being a stickler on conservative interpretations of telecommunications law and the limits of the F. C. C. ’s authority Mr. Pai said he was trying to wipe the slate clean . He noted that his predecessor Tom Wheeler had rammed through a series of actions right after the presidential election . Many of those efforts Mr. Pai argued went beyond the agency ’s legal authority . “ These actions which did not enjoy the support of the majority of commissioners at the time they were taken should not bind us going forward
" WASHINGTON — Some of the current members of the Supreme Court had written books before they were nominated . Remember “ Civil Procedure in Sweden ” by Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg ? Or “ Regulation and Its Reform ” by Justice Stephen G. Breyer ? Perhaps not . But a book by Judge Neil M. Gorsuch President Trump ’s pick for the Supreme Court may make a more lasting impression . It is called “ The Future of Assisted Suicide and Euthanasia ” and it opens a window into Judge Gorsuch ’s thinking not only on those topics which are interesting enough but also on the relationship between them and abortion . The book published in 2006 is ambitious learned balanced and unusually lucid at ease in philosophy law and empirical research . It discusses the Supreme Court ’s abortion jurisprudence in detail but Judge Gorsuch ’s goal was not to critique those cases . He asked rather whether a constitutional right to abortion necessarily implies a right to assisted suicide and euthanasia . Sure there are general statements about the value of human life drawn from what Judge Gorsuch called “ secular moral theory . ” “ Human life is fundamentally and inherently valuable ” he wrote adding that “ the intentional taking of human life by private persons is always wrong . ” This led him to support existing laws barring assisted suicide and euthanasia . But that broad statement does not answer the question of whether a fetus is a human life in the sense that Judge Gorsuch meant
" WASHINGTON — Emboldened by weeks of protests across the country congressional Democrats are digging in as Republicans try to swiftly remake a government shaped by the Obama administration . Tensions over President Trump ’s early efforts to deliver on a long menu of campaign promises have spilled into the halls of Congress turning debates into a proxy battle over a combative president . With the Senate already hinting it could work through the weekend expect another busy week at the Capitol . Let us get you up to speed . ■ Vice President Mike Pence could well be needed to break a tie in the Senate over the nomination of Betsy DeVos as education secretary . ■ Mr. Trump ’s nominee for attorney general Senator Jeff Sessions of Alabama could be confirmed by the end of the week . ■ Republicans in Congress will also vote to roll back regulations . Mr. Pence may be summoned to the Capitol early this week to cast the 51st vote to confirm Ms. DeVos as education secretary over vociferous now bipartisan objections . The Senate could vote on her nomination as late as Tuesday . Congressional trivia buffs take note : It would be the first time that the vice president has been forced to cast a tiebreaking vote on a cabinet nomination said Betty K. Koed the Senate historian . Senators Susan Collins of Maine and Lisa Murkowski of Alaska thrust Ms. DeVos ’s nomination into question last week when they became the first two Republicans to declare their opposition . Should the Democratic caucus vote as a bloc their votes would set up a tie that Mr. Pence would have to settle in his capacity as president of the Senate . The Capitol has been flooded with thousands of constituent calls and messages many of them urging senators to vote against Ms. DeVos . Still it looks unlikely that any more Republicans will defect and that would be enough to confirm her . Once the Senate deals with the DeVos nomination it will move on to the nomination of Mr. Sessions to be attorney general . First comes a procedural vote that sets the timer for up to 30 hours of debate before the final vote . That means Mr. Sessions ’s confirmation vote should come later this week at which point the Senate will start the process over with the nomination of Representative Tom Price of Georgia to be secretary of health and human services followed by a vote on the nomination of Steven T. Mnuchin to be Treasury secretary . Of course just because Democrats may not have the votes to block Mr. Trump ’s cabinet nominees does not mean they will go quietly . Having stacked up as many parliamentary roadblocks as they could find last week Democrats are expected to take advantage of the mandatory debate time probably to air their concerns about Mr. Trump ’s picks as well as grievances against their Republican counterparts
" HOUSTON — The chants rang out loud and long at NRG Stadium in South Texas not from bars or living rooms across New England until a wall of sound enveloped a team and a quarterback on a mission . “ Brady Brady ” the fans screamed and it is in moments like this — the first overtime in Super Bowl history — that Tom Brady appears most comfortable as if lounging on his sofa in his beloved Uggs . In each of his previous four Super Bowl victories Brady guided drives for the Patriots . However sublime those efforts against the Rams the Panthers the Eagles and the Seahawks all seemed quaint before Sunday night . That is when Brady again summoned the sorcery of his right arm to stun the Atlanta Falcons in what is undoubtedly the greatest late surge in a Super Bowl . When James White sneaked into the end zone from 2 yards away completing a victory that defied the bounds of credulity and secured the Patriots ’ fifth title his teammates stormed onto the field flung their helmets and hugged anyone who moved . Across the field the Falcons watched from their sideline as if fossilized in amber too exhausted and dumbstruck to move . The Patriots trailed by 25 points with 2 minutes 12 seconds remaining in the third quarter — and by 19 with 9:48 left in regulation — and they won . They won because of Dont’a Hightower ’s critical and Julian Edelman ’s Velcro hands and the clock management and coaching of a maestro Bill Belichick but mostly because of a truism that has beleaguered the league ’s other 31 teams for 16 years running : the Patriots have Brady and no one else does not even the Falcons who boasted the N. F. L. ’s most valuable player in Matt Ryan . Super Bowl LI Box Score Not including their possession at the end of regulation

" Picking the pain reliever that ’s best for you can be a confusing task . Pharmacy and supermarket shelves are lined with a dizzying array of boxes names and labels describing the symptoms the medications are intended to address . While they all share the same goal making you feel better their active ingredients vary and all have potential drawbacks . Dr. Robert A. Duarte director of the Pain Center at Northwell Health in Great Neck N. Y. cautioned that consumers should not be lulled into thinking that pain relievers are free from potential harm just because they are available on store shelves . Sales of medications exceeded $ 30 billion in 2015 with pain relievers ranking near the top according to industry statistics . Consumers need to be informed about what they are taking and in what doses . A survey conducted in 2001 for the National Council on Patient Information and Education found that only of those polled could identify the active ingredient in their pain reliever . A similar fraction of consumers said they had taken more than the recommended dose of nonprescription medication because they believed it would increase its effectiveness . Dr. Sadiah Siddiqui an anesthesiologist specializing in interventional pain medicine at Weill Cornell Medicine in Manhattan said consumers need to read the labels of the medications for their active ingredients . Those who take any kind of pain reliever around the clock for a week or more should see a specialist or their doctor she added . Here are the major categories of nonprescription pain relievers and some of what you should know about them : Common brand name : Tylenol Recommended to treat : Headaches pain and fever Potential side effects:The Food and Drug Administration recommends a maximum of 4000 milligrams per day . Exceeding that level can mean the liver has to work harder . Clinicians recommend a daily maximum dose of 3000 if it is taken for an extended period . What else you should know : Concerns about potential liver damage from taking acetaminophen have been clouded over time Dr. Duarte said . The warnings surfaced because patients were taking Tylenol with other medications or prescriptions that also contained acetaminophen . For instance the prescription painkiller Percocet and cold and flu remedies have Tylenol in them . When patients take those drugs as well as Tylenol they can unwittingly get higher doses of acetaminophen than they should he said . “ You may not think you are taking that much Tylenol but yes you are
" SUNDARBANS NATIONAL PARK Bangladesh Two hundred years ago the first cholera pandemic emerged from these mangrove swamps . It began in 1817 after the British East India Company sent thousands of workers deep into the remote Sundarbans part of the Ganges River Delta to log the jungles and plant rice . These brackish waters are the cradle of Vibrio cholerae a bacterium that clings to human intestines and emits a toxin so virulent that the body will pour all of its fluids into the gut to flush it out . Water loss turns victims ashen their eyes sink into their sockets and their blood turns black and congeals in their capillaries . Robbed of electrolytes their hearts lose their beat . Victims die of shock and organ failure sometimes in as little as six hours after the first abdominal rumblings . Cholera probably had festered here for eons . Since that first escape it has circled the world in seven pandemic cycles that have killed tens of millions . Artists of the 19th century often depicted it as a skeleton with a scythe and victims heaped at its feet . It stalked revelers at a masked ball in Heinrich Heine ’s “ Cholera in Paris ” and kills the protagonist in Thomas Mann ’s “ Death in Venice . ” Outbreaks forced London New York and other cities to create vast public water systems transforming civic life . Today cholera garners panicky headlines when it strikes unexpectedly in places like Ethiopia or Haiti . But it is a continuing threat in nearly 70 countries where more than one billion people are at risk . Now thanks largely to efforts that began in cholera ’s birthplace a way to finally conquer the plague is in sight . A treatment protocol so effective that it saves 99 . 9 percent of all victims was pioneered here . The World Health Organization estimates that it has saved about 50 million lives in the past four decades . Just as important after 35 years of work researchers in Bangladesh and elsewhere have developed an effective cholera vaccine . It has been accepted by the W. H. O. and stockpiled for epidemics like the one that struck Haiti in 2010 . Soon there may be enough to begin routine vaccination in countries where the disease has a permanent foothold . Merely creating that stockpile — even of a few million doses — profoundly improved the way the world fought cholera Dr. Margaret Chan secretary general of the W. H. O. said last year . Ready access to the vaccine has made countries less tempted to cover up outbreaks to protect tourism
" JERUSALEM — Israel ’s Parliament passed a provocative law late Monday that would retroactively legalize Jewish settlements on privately owned Palestinian land pressing ahead with a statement of assertiveness despite the likelihood that the country ’s high court will nullify the legislation . It was a defining — opponents said frightening — moment in Israel ’s relations with Palestinians and amid fading hopes of ending decades of conflict through a solution . While polls consistently show that most Israelis still support two states their leaders and the reality of what is happening on the ground are consistently heading in the opposite direction : Fifty years after Israel defeated Jordan and captured the West Bank and East Jerusalem many politicians say that now — with negotiations with the Palestinians frozen — is the moment Israel must decide what it wants and act decisively on it . The new law is “ deteriorating Israel ’s democracy making stealing an official policy and bringing us one step closer to annexation ” of more land Palestinians claim for a future state said Anat Ben Nun the director of external relations for Peace Now an group . Only a few months ago the law was believed to have little chance of coming up for a vote . Even Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu who was flying back from a meeting with Britain ’s leaders as the law was being debated seemed to oppose its passage for fear of further international censure . The bill had been so contentious that the nation ’s attorney general who described it as unconstitutional and in contravention of international law said he would not defend it in the high court which seemed in any case likely to nullify it . That is partly because the law applies to Palestinians and their property rights . Since Palestinians in the occupied West Bank are not Israeli citizens and cannot vote for candidates for Israel ’s Parliament or Knesset critics of the legislation say it is inherently . Under the law Palestinian landowners will be offered compensation for the use of their property but will not be able to reclaim it . But the bill gained internal momentum through several forces : Mr. Netanyahu is determined to show his support to the powerful settler movement and is under pressure from on the right and from corruption investigations that even his supporters say appear serious . That pressure intensified last week after Mr. Netanyahu ’s government carried out a court order to evacuate about 40 settler families at the Amona outpost declared illegal a decade ago . “ Today Israel decreed that developing settlement in Judea and Samaria is an Israeli interest ” said Bezalel Smotrich a lawmaker
" MOUNT VERNON Va . — The costumed characters at George Washington ’s gracious estate here are used to handling all manner of awkward queries whether about privies or the first president ’s teeth . So when a visitor recently asked an in a full skirt and head scarf if she knew Ona Judge the woman didn ’t miss a beat . Judge ’s escape from the presidential residence in Philadelphia in 1796 had been “ a great embarrassment to General and Lady Washington ” the woman said before offering her own view of the matter . “ Ona was born free like everybody ” she said . “ It was this world that made her a slave . ” It ’s always 1799 at Mount Vernon where more than a million visitors annually see the property as it was just before Washington ’s death when his will famously freed all 123 of his slaves . That liberation did not apply to Ona Judge one of 153 slaves held by Martha Washington . But Judge it turned out evaded the Washingtons ’ dogged ( and sometimes illegal ) efforts to recapture her and would live quietly in New Hampshire for another 50 years . Now her story — and the challenge it offers to the notion that Washington somehow transcended the seamy reality of slaveholding — is having its fullest airing yet . Judge is among the 19 enslaved people highlighted in “ Lives Bound Together : Slavery at George Washington ’s Mount Vernon ” the first major exhibition here dedicated to the topic . She is also the subject of a book “ Never Caught : The Washingtons ’ Relentless Pursuit of Their Runaway Slave Ona Judge ” by Erica Armstrong Dunbar . Most scholars who have written about Judge ’s escape have used it as a lens onto Washington ’s evolving ideas about slavery . But “ Never Caught ” published on Tuesday by 37 Ink flips the perspective focusing on what freedom meant to the people he kept in bondage . “ We have the famous fugitives
2.0"LONDON — In another era they could have been allies . Both vicars ’ daughters and born just a few years apart Chancellor Angela Merkel of Germany and Prime Minister Theresa May of Britain share an understated pragmatism and conservative roots and have made their way in the still largely man ’s world of politics . But there could be so much more . At a time when President Trump is lashing out at friend and foe and when the macho politics of strongmen is resurgent from Moscow to Manila when not just the European Union but Western values free trade and security alliances are under attack the two women might have worked together to defend the liberal global order . Instead because of Britain ’s vote in June to leave the European Union they find themselves on opposite sides of the biggest divorce in recent European history a chasm that has fundamentally reordered their priorities and is hindering them from cooperating on the broader issues . At a meeting of European leaders in Malta last week Mrs. May and Ms. Merkel abruptly canceled a planned bilateral meeting after a brief exchange during a sightseeing excursion was deemed enough . After lunch when it came to discussing the threats facing Europe Mrs. May was shown the door . Their differing priorities were on ample display this past week as they dealt with both Mr. Trump and President Recep Tayyip Erdogan of Turkey . Ms. Merkel whose overriding strategic ambition as Germany ’s leader is to save the European Union has kept her distance from Mr. Trump . After his election she firmly outlined the liberal values on which she was prepared to work with him and she swiftly condemned his travel ban aimed at seven countries . Mrs. May whose priority is to sign bilateral trade deals to offset her country ’s departure from Europe ’s single market rushed to be the first foreign leader received by Mr. Trump after he took office . Apparently pleased to be caught on camera holding his hand
" KABUL Afghanistan — Months after intense fighting between the Afghan government and the Taliban subsided on the outskirts of Kunduz Hajji Habib Rahmani ’s family decided to go ahead with a delayed wedding . Amid the festivities Abdul Basit one of the children playing behind the house picked up an unexploded shell and it blew up . Basit 14 and his brother Haroon 8 were killed and 12 other children ages 7 to 15 were wounded . The shell had been “ fired from a helicopter during the fighting and it hadn ’t exploded ” said Mr. Rahmani an uncle of the two brothers . On Monday the United Nations Mission in Afghanistan reported that 2016 had been another year of record civilian casualties in the country and it expressed particular concern about a 65 percent jump in the number of children killed or wounded by explosive remnants as fighting has spread to heavily populated civilian areas . The report by the United Nations Assistance Mission in Afghanistan or Unama said overall civilian casualties had continued their steady increase in recent years . In 2016 3
" Russia will almost certainly be barred from this summer ’s track and field world championships global officials for the sport said Monday citing the nation ’s response to its doping scandal which they called inadequate . The officials met in Monaco on Monday and voted unanimously to maintain the ban on Russian athletes outlining a timetable under which the nation would not be cleared to compete until November . Until then individual Russian athletes with robust histories of drug testing may petition to compete as neutral athletes unassociated with any country in the world championships which will take place in August in London as well as other global events . Officials agreed to exempt Russia ’s youngest athletes from the blanket ban allowing for those under 15 to compete as neutral individuals without filing a special application . Citing a number of issues — including ”unhelpful comments ” by Russia ’s deputy prime minister Vitaly Mutko limited and problematic drug testing within the country and evidence that an implicated coach had continued to train athletes in spite of having been suspended — Rune Andersen the chairman of a global task force overseeing Russia ’s reform said the nation had not yet met the conditions for reinstatement . Among those conditions is that Russia ’s national antidoping agency be fully recertified by the World Agency the global regulator of drugs in sports . That agency has suggested it may grant Russia partial certification in May track officials said Monday and full certification in November . Only after that point Mr. Andersen said would track and field authorities consider restoring Russia to good standing . “ The criteria were very clear ” said Sebastian Coe president of the International Association of Athletics Federations
" TUNIS — Since their revolution in 2011 Tunisians have tussled among themselves to define their new identity after successive dictatorships . Belatedly they have started reclaiming their history as well . Dictatorships have a way of manipulating historical narratives . So alongside any of the most pressing issues of the day the past too is in play . The struggle to shape the past and give it new authenticity can be witnessed all around the Tunisian capital . Last summer the Tunisian government restored a statue of Habib Bourguiba the founder and first president of the republic to its original place on the capital ’s main avenue . The famous symbol of Mr. Bourguiba — astride his horse arm aloft rallying Tunisians to independence — had been banished to a seaside neighborhood in 1987 after he was ousted by his prime minister Zine Ben Ali . ( Mr. Ben Ali was himself overthrown decades later during the Arab Spring uprising . ) The current president Beji Caid Essebsi who served in Mr. Bourguiba ’s cabinet was the main driver behind reinstating the statue which he said was intended to reinforce his call for national unity and a strong state . Mr. Bourguiba ’s statue had replaced a humiliating symbol of colonialism : an image of the colonialist politician Jules Ferry with a Tunisian woman at his feet proffering an olive branch he reminded Tunisians . “ That used to be the symbol of colonialism and Bourguiba is the symbol of freedom of independence and of the modern state

" LONDON — To celebrate Queen Elizabeth II ’s sapphire jubilee on Monday marking 65 years on the British throne there were new coins a new stamp gun salutes and a reissued portrait taken by a famed photographer . The only thing missing ? The queen who in keeping with past practice on the anniversary itself planned to observe the day privately with a quiet reflective commemoration at her estate in Sandringham in eastern England . Grander celebrations are in the works for the platinum jubilee in 2022 . Royal jubilees commemorate the life and reign of monarchs . Elizabeth 90 the world ’s monarch is the first British sovereign to hold a sapphire jubilee . The events were relatively muted compared to the silver ( 25 years ) gold ( 50 years ) and diamond ( 60 years ) jubilees which were celebrated with festivities across Britain . There was a ruby jubilee to mark Elizabeth ’s 40 years as queen but that anniversary was also . Few British monarchs have reached the milestone . King George III and Queen Victoria marked their golden jubilees with huge celebrations . Elizabeth was expected to spend the anniversary at Sandringham and there will be no broader celebrations in coming days as there had been for previous jubilees . She was apparently in “ good spirits ” at a church service on Sunday local news outlets reported . There have been concerns about the queen ’s health ever since she missed church services on Christmas Day and on New Year ’s Day because of what Buckingham Palace described as a “ heavy cold . ” Those absences were the first time in about 30 years that she had missed a holiday service . The queen made her first public appearance this year on Jan. 8 after a month ’s absence . She celebrated her diamond jubilee in 2012
2.0"Music was not only Walter Hautzig ’s vocation . It also won over the young woman who would become his wife . And it saved his life . Mr. Hautzig a concert pianist who escaped from Vienna as a teenager armed with a fellowship from the Jerusalem Conservatory and went on to become a touring musical ambassador died on Monday at his home in Manhattan . He was 95 . The cause was congestive heart failure his daughter Deborah Hautzig said . Only five years after he blustered his way into an audition with the conservatory ’s director in 1938 the Mr. Hautzig made his American debut at Town Hall in New York with an ambitious program of Bach Beethoven and Chopin . A reviewer for The New York Times said it “ augured a brilliant career . ” Years later Mr. Hautzig recalled “ My father said I should be a doctor or a lawyer but after Town Hall he never left the house without the New York Times review in his pocket . ” Mr. Hautzig ( pronounced ) won the 1943 Town Hall Endowment Series Award for best young artist that year . He later became a cultural ambassador for the United States performing around the world for three decades . In the 1950 s he performed frequently in Japan under State Department sponsorship . In 1979 after relations thawed he was the first American artist officially delegated to perform in mainland China . “ Beethoven and Chopin are as good for the Asians as for the Europeans as for the Jews as for the gentiles ” he told The Forward in 2007 . He refused however to perform before a racially segregated audience in Alabama in the 1940 s . “ He told the concert manager ‘ You ’re as bad as the Nazis ! ’ ” Ms. Hautzig
" LINCOLN IN THE BARDOBy George Saunders343 pages . Random House . $ 28 . George Saunders ’s first novel “ Lincoln in the Bardo ” is like a weird folk art diorama of a cemetery come to life . Picture as a backdrop one of those primitively drawn mourning paintings with rickety white gravestones and monuments standing under the faded green canopy of a couple of delicately sketched trees . Add a tall sad mourner grieving over his recently deceased son . And then to make things stranger populate the rest of the scene with some Edward ghosts skittering across the landscape — at once menacing comical and slightly . “ Lincoln in the Bardo ” takes as its point the death of Abraham Lincoln ’s beloved son Willie who succumbed to typhoid fever on Feb. 201862 and the president ’s visits to the crypt where his son was interred at the Oak Hill Cemetery in nearby Georgetown . Saunders intercuts facts and ( culled from books and news accounts ) in a narrative with some ghost stories of his own imagining allowing a chorus of disembodied spirits to describe Lincoln ’s visits while babbling on about their own regrets and misplaced dreams . “ Bardo ” is the Tibetan Buddhist name for a transition period between death and rebirth and seems to indicate in this case the bizarre purgatory inhabited by these ghosts . The supernatural chatter can grow tedious at times — the novel would have benefited immensely from some judicious pruning — but their voices gain emotional momentum as the book progresses . And they lend the story a choral dimension that turns Lincoln ’s personal grief into a meditation on the losses suffered by the nation during the Civil War
" Driving down a tight mountain road in Jarabacoa a town in the middle of the Dominican Republic Oscar Pedro Duran Abreu saw the oncoming Jeep weaving in the other lane before it hit him . He remembers trying to swerve . He remembers the Jeep slamming into his side door pushing his car into the safety blocks on the side of the road saving him from a steep fall down the mountainside . “ And I don ’t remember anything else ” he said of that day in September 2010 . Mr. Duran learned later that the other driver had been drunk and that his Jeep had flipped . The four passengers in the Jeep were injured but the driver unharmed pushed his way out of the vehicle and fled . “ Leaving me for dead ” Mr. Duran said .

" WASHINGTON — Betsy DeVos a wealthy Republican donor with almost no experience in public education was confirmed by the Senate as the nation ’s education secretary on Tuesday but only with the help of a historic tiebreaking vote from Vice President Mike Pence after weeks of protests and two defections within her own party . The vote capped an vigil on the Senate floor where one by one Democrats denounced Ms. DeVos to a mostly empty chamber . But they did not get a third Republican defection that would have stopped Ms. DeVos — a billionaire who has devoted much of her life to promoting charter schools and vouchers — from becoming the steward of the nation ’s nearly 100000 public schools . It was the first time a vice president has been summoned to the Capitol to break a tie on a cabinet nomination . Senator Al Franken Democrat of Minnesota demanded before the vote that Republicans explain how they could support Ms. DeVos . “ If we cannot set aside party loyalty long enough to perform the essential duty of vetting the president ’s nominees what are we even doing here ? ” Mr. Franken asked . The two Republicans who voted against the nominee Senators Susan Collins of Maine and Lisa Murkowski of Alaska said Ms. DeVos was unqualified because of a lack of familiarity with public schools and with laws meant to protect students . “ I have serious concerns about a nominee to be secretary of education who has been so involved in one side of the equation so immersed in the push for vouchers that she may be unaware of what actually is successful within the public schools and also what is broken and how to fix them ” Ms. Murkowski said last week when the two announced their opposition . Ms. Murkowski also said she had been influenced by thousands of messages she had received urging her to reject the nomination . For many educators Ms. DeVos ’s support for charter schools and vouchers — which allow students to use taxpayer dollars to pay tuition at private religious and schools — reflected a deep disconnect from public schools . Neither Ms. DeVos nor any of her children attended a public school . Most Republicans described Ms. DeVos as committed to what is best for children . In a fiery speech moments before the vote Senator Lamar Alexander Republican of Tennessee and a former education secretary himself
" The White House has issued a list of 78 terrorist attacks saying most were underreported . The Trump administration under fire for immigration restrictions and other policies it says are designed to curb terrorism has portrayed the news media and other institutions as playing down the threat . But the list which was released on Monday night and details episodes from September 2014 to December 2016 includes dozens of attacks that were covered heavily in the news media including by The New York Times . ( Examples are included in the list below . ) Just as striking was what the list excluded : attacks targeting Muslims who make up the overwhelming majority of victims of Islamist terrorism . The list does not mention for instance two suicide bombings in Beirut Lebanon that killed dozens in November 2015 or the wave of Boko Haram attacks across northern Nigeria which have been among the world ’s deadliest terrorist assaults . Though there have been many attacks in Kabul the capital of Afghanistan the list mentions only one : a June 2016 bombing that killed Nepali and Indian security contractors . The list describes the target as “ a bus carrying Canadian Embassy guards ” which is correct but in keeping with the document ’s emphasis on Western targets — a focus that is sometimes misleadingly narrow . Prominent attacks carried out by are also conspicuously omitted . In June 2015 Dylann S. Roof opened fire in a predominantly black church in Charleston S. C. killing nine . That November three people were shot to death at a Planned Parenthood office in Colorado Springs . Robert L. Dear Jr . describing himself as a “ warrior for the babies ” acknowledged that he had carried out the attack

" ROME — When Stephen K. Bannon was still heading Breitbart News he went to the Vatican to cover the canonization of John Paul II and make some friends . High on his list of people to meet was an archconservative American cardinal Raymond Burke who had openly clashed with Pope Francis . In one of the cardinal ’s antechambers amid religious statues and walls Cardinal Burke and Mr. Bannon — who is now President Trump ’s eminence — bonded over their shared worldview . They saw Islam as threatening to overrun a prostrate West weakened by the erosion of traditional Christian values and viewed themselves as unjustly ostracized by political elites . “ When you recognize someone who has sacrificed in order to remain true to his principles and who is fighting the same kind of battles in the cultural arena in a different section of the battlefield I ’m not surprised there is a meeting of hearts ” said Benjamin Harnwell a confidant of Cardinal Burke who arranged the 2014 meeting . While Mr. Trump a president who has boasted of groping women may seem an unlikely ally of traditionalists in the Vatican many of them regard his election and the ascendance of Mr. Bannon as potentially breakthroughs . Just as Mr. Bannon has connected with parties threatening to topple governments throughout Western Europe he has also made common cause with elements in the Roman Catholic Church who oppose the direction Francis is taking them . Many share Mr. Bannon ’s suspicion of Pope Francis as a dangerously misguided and probably socialist pontiff . Until now Francis has marginalized or demoted the traditionalists notably Cardinal Burke carrying out an inclusive agenda on migration climate change and poverty that has made the pope a figure of unmatched global popularity
" A lawsuit filed by Melania Trump depicts her heightened profile as a “ unique opportunity ” to make millions of dollars in business once again raising questions about the relationship between President Trump ’s official role and his family ’s business interests . Mrs. Trump ’s suit filed on Monday in a New York State court accuses The Daily Mail a British tabloid of libel for reporting last year on claims that a modeling agency she worked for in the 1990 s was also an escort service . The new complaint does not refer explicitly to the White House or Mr. Trump or even her status as a candidate ’s wife when the article was published and now as first lady . Instead it refers to opportunities she had “ to launch a commercial brand in multiple product categories each of which could have garnered multimillion dollar business relationships for a multiyear term during which plaintiff is one of the most photographed women in the world . ” Because of the Daily Mail article it says “ plaintiff ’s brand has lost significant value ” greatly reducing those opportunities . It claims $ 150 million in damages . A spokeswoman for Mrs. Trump said she was not trying to make money from her role as first lady . Mr. Trump has fended off criticism that his business dealings around the world create conflicts of interest in his official role and he has put his adult sons in charge of his businesses rather than sell his assets or put them into a blind trust . On the day he took office the White House altered its online biography of Mrs. Trump after complaints that the original wording promoted her line of jewelry . The Daily Mail published its article on Mrs. Trump on Aug. 20 quoting from a report in a magazine in Slovenia Mrs. Trump ’s native country and a book about her . She and her representatives have insisted that the claims it repeated are false . On Sept. 1 Mrs. Trump sued The Daily Mail in a state court in Montgomery County
" TEHRAN — With Iran calibrating how to deal with President Trump its supreme leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei caustically thanked the new American leader on Tuesday for revealing “ the true face ” of the United States . “ We are thankful to this newcomer ” Ayatollah Khamenei told Iranian Air Force commanders according to a report posted on his official website . Iranian officials had been showing caution since Mr. Trump took office last month . Despite expressing anger at his policies and comments even have taken care not to provoke the new American president . But on Tuesday it became seemingly apparent to Iran ’s leaders that Mr. Trump is not easily ignored . After Ayatollah Khamenei spoke out sarcastically about Mr. Trump others expressed worries . Iran ’s foreign minister Mohammad Javad Zarif said in an interview with a local newspaper that he expected “ difficult times ahead ” for Iran now that Mr. Trump was in charge . Iran ’s president Hassan Rouhani defended the nuclear agreement between his country and six world powers including the United States by saying that the deal was “ ” for all . But Mr. Trump — who has described the nuclear agreement as “ really really bad ” but has not made any moves to alter it — disparaged Iran again on Twitter this time in a defense against criticism that he is too close to Russia and its leader President Vladimir V. Putin . Mr. Trump wondered how President Barack Obama could have made a nuclear agreement with Iran a country Mr. Trump described as “ #1 in terror . ” Mr. Trump seemed to be summarizing comments by his defense secretary Jim Mattis
2.0"WASHINGTON — Andrew F. Puzder who as President Trump ’s pick to head the Labor Department has come under fire for criticizing worker protections acknowledged on Monday that he had employed an undocumented immigrant to clean his house . The revelation potentially could derail a nomination that has elicited controversy because of Mr. Puzder ’s views on overtime pay sick leave and automation . The confirmation of Mr. Puzder a chain executive has stalled as he tries to divest holdings . “ My wife and I employed a housekeeper for a few years during which I was unaware that she was not legally permitted to work in the U. S. ” Mr. Puzder said in a statement . “ When I learned of her status we immediately ended her employment and offered her assistance in getting legal status . ” Mr. Puzder added that he and his wife had paid back taxes in full to the I. R. S. and the state of California . Confirmation hearings for Mr. Puzder have been delayed as he works to remove himself from his role as the chief executive of CKE Restaurants whose holdings include the Carl ’s Jr . and Hardee ’s chains . Democrats have suggested that his nomination could be on shaky ground in part because he has yet to file standard disclosures and questionnaires to the Senate committee that will consider his confirmation . Progressive groups have echoed that sentiment . “ It ’s long past time for Mr. Puzder to deliver on his commitment to file paperwork with the Senate and let the American people know what issues are causing so many headaches for the Trump administration ” Karl Frisch executive director of Allied Progress said on Monday . Mr. Puzder remains “ all in ” for the confirmation process a spokesman said on Monday . He is not the first cabinet nominee who has hired undocumented workers . Mr. Trump ’s choice to lead the Commerce Department Wilbur Ross said last month that he had employed an undocumented household worker for several years .

2.0"HONG KONG — Three masked explorers appeared atop an apartment tower in Hong Kong ’s North Point district and sent a black drone flying over a clothesline until it was buzzing more than 10 stories above the cars trams and pedestrians on the street below . If history was any guide the explorers said the building the drone was filming — a 1952 theater with unusual roof supports — would eventually be demolished because it is not on Hong Kong ’s list of declared monuments . The authorities are “ renewing the city on behalf of the developers not the people ” said one of the explorers who goes by the alias Ghost in videos and whose pollution mask and fingerless gloves gave him the air of a bank robber or graffiti artist . The explorers belong to HK Urbex a urban exploration collective whose expeditions often require trespassing or walks through dark abandoned or dangerous sites . But unlike some urban explorers they do not court danger purely for its own sake . Their primary goal is to peel back layers of history — sometimes literally by digging through dust and trash — and forge a video archive of Hong Kong ’s environment . “ Until you peel them back you don ’t know what existed before ” said Ghost 33 . “ Others are interested in the adrenaline rush but we ’re interested in the story . What can it tell us about the past ? ” Many buildings that went up here before Hong Kong ’s 1997 return to China from British colonial rule have already been replaced by taller ones as exceptionally high property values create economic incentives to cram more towers into an already crowded skyline . But some buildings lie fallow for years between tenant evictions and demolition and others

Mr. Schreiber who had a previous criminal record and who had posted views on social media told detectives he set fire to the Islamic Center of Fort Pierce on the anniversary of the Sept. 11 terror attacks which in 2016 also fell on Eid an important Muslim holiday Assistant State Attorney Steve Gosnell said . The mosque was so badly damaged — photos published online show a gaping hole in the roof and an interior burned to a crisp — that it is expected to be relocated . The mosque about an hour ’s drive north of Palm Beach was occasionally attended by Mr. Mateen the Islamic State supporter who shot and killed 49 people and wounded 53 others on June 12 at the Pulse nightclub in Orlando the deadliest mass shooting in modern American history . Mr. Mateen was killed by police officers responding to the mass shooting . Before Mr. Schreiber was sentenced he read aloud a lengthy statement in which he said the arson had been driven by anxiety not hate . Florida he said could be targeted in another terrorist attack . “ My message is this to all the Muslim communities on the face of the Earth : Make peace with America and make peace with Israel and stop the killings stop the attacks ” he said . Mr. Gosnell
" Rebecca Blumenstein deputy editor in chief of The Wall Street Journal has been named a deputy managing editor of The New York Times one of the top leadership positions at the newspaper . Ms. Blumenstein will become one of the women in The Times ’s newsroom . She will join three other deputy managing editors — Janet Elder Clifford Levy who was promoted last week and Matthew Purdy . In a note to the staff announcing the appointment on Tuesday Dean Baquet the executive editor and Joe Kahn the managing editor said that Ms. Blumenstein 50 would help the newsroom “ do all the big things we intend to do in 2017 and beyond . ” In particular they said Ms. Blumenstein “ will focus on making sure we remain an essential destination for readers interested in business finance economics and technology . ” In recent months the newsroom has had a dearth of female leaders . In September Susan Chira stepped down as deputy executive editor to write about gender issues and in December Lydia Polgreen an associate masthead editor
" BEIRUT Lebanon — The Syrian government has executed 5000 to 13000 people in mass hangings in just one of its many prisons since the start of the uprising against President Bashar Amnesty International contends in a new report . The report on the Saydnaya military prison which Amnesty said was based on interviews with former detainees there prison employees judges and others accuses the Syrian government of systematically executing perceived opponents after sham trials that lasted just a few minutes . Inmates are kept under conditions so dismal — including regular severe beatings and deprivation of food water medicine and basic sanitation — that they amount to deliberate extermination defined under international law as a crime against humanity the report said . While inhumane prison conditions in Syria have been known for decades the Amnesty report laid out what it described as new details — not documented by any human rights monitoring group to date — about the scale of the killings and the state systems required to facilitate them including approvals by officials . “ We now know where when and how often these hangings are taking place as well as which elements of the Syrian government have authorized them ” said Nicolette Waldman an Amnesty researcher specializing in detention issues and one of the report ’s authors . Mr. Assad in an interview with The New York Times and other journalists last year insisted that detainees were being treated according to Syrian law and that their families could locate them by appealing to the judicial system . But the report corroborates numerous accounts given to The Times by current and former detainees in several prisons across Syria
" Thousands of years ago every lake was like Great Bear Lake . So pure you could lower a cup into the water and drink it . So beautiful that people composed love songs to it . So mysterious that many believed it was alive . Today of the 10 largest lakes in the world it is the last one that remains essentially primeval . Great Bear Lake straddles the Arctic Circle in the remote Northwest Territories of Canada . At just over 12000 square miles the lake is the eighth largest in the world . It is bigger than Belgium and deeper than Lake Superior and it is covered in ice and snow most of the year . The surrounding area is wilderness too — a sprawling land of untouched boreal forest and tundra rivers and mountains . The only human settlement on its shores is the town of Deline population 503 . This isolated community is mostly Sahtuto’ine meaning the Bear Lake People . They are as connected to the lake as the name implies and for practical cultural historic and even prophetic reasons they are determined to keep it pristine . Their efforts paid off in 2016 . In March the Great Bear Lake watershed was declared a Unesco Biosphere Reserve . Called the Tsá Tué Biosphere Reserve it is the largest in North America and the first in the world to be led by an indigenous community . Several months later the Canadian government granted Deline ensuring local control in areas like language and education . It is the first time that an aboriginal government in Canada will represent everyone in the community aboriginal and nonaboriginal alike . Taken together the Unesco and announcements reinforce Deline ’s ability to control what happens to Great Bear Lake . David Livingstone
" EVERYONE is familiar with this scenario : An app you once loved no longer brings the same joy . It ’s gotten buggy over time or an update transformed it to the point it became unusable . Chances are you thought about calling it quits . But after years of sharing your personal data with this app you probably gave up and stayed in this stale relationship . You put up with the bugs and odd design changes because moving to a new potentially better app felt harder than sticking with the bad one . Take Evernote the app . After nearly a decade attracting millions of users the company last year severely restricted free use of its software while raising prices for its plans by as much as 40 percent . This month Evernote also released a redesign for its mobile app which users complained was bloated with unnecessary features that have made note taking too complex . Even so people have stuck with Evernote partly because taking their notes elsewhere is hardly easy . ”We understand those kind of changes don ’t make everyone happy ” said Greg Chiemingo an Evernote spokesman . “ In fact we ’ve seen continued growth of paying customers over the last two years . ” People deserve better than this . Every day you stay with a bad app is time you could be spending with a superior product that will make life better . Here are my tips based on interviews and personal experience for a clean break . No app is perfect but you have to draw the line somewhere . The problem is you may be in such a rut that you can ’t recognize the warning signs . An obvious one is when an app stops working reliably in a way that affects your life . For instance I called it quits on Apple ’s Calendar app when I was planning a dinner with friends last month and the software sent a calendar invite in Greenwich Mean Time rather than Pacific Standard Time . As a result one person thought we were meeting on Saturday instead of Friday and didn ’t show up . ( It wasn ’t the first time this happened either . ) Brian Fitzpatrick a former manager at Google who led a team that developed tools to help people move their data to and from Google said he dumps an app when it has stopped improving . “ It ’s still functioning
" For people in the market for a used car the “ certified ” designation has long been the gold standard an indication that a qualified mechanic has vouched for the car and that a buyer can expect a vehicle that is — hopefully — almost as good as new . But the Takata airbag recall which is the biggest in history has upended all of that . Now the certified designation — known in the auto trade as C. P. O. — will no longer necessarily have the same meaning . For one thing last month the Federal Trade Commission made it easier for cars to be billed as “ certified ” even if they were under recall and hadn ’t been fixed yet . And just as significantly Ford — with the F. T. C. settlement for cover — told its dealers this week that they could sell recalled vehicles and certify them too so long as they did not advertise them as “ safe ” and required buyers to sign forms acknowledging that they were aware of the problem . Against this backdrop one dealer in Florida has refused to sell recalled vehicles that he cannot get fixed letting 100 or so pile up on a lot miles from his main showroom . He even sued a rival who he believes is selling recalled cars without disclosing that they have not been fixed yet . How did the market get so confusing all of a sudden ? For starters the Takata airbag recall is unprecedented in its scope with over 60 million airbags affected but also in its complexity . Dealers can ’t simply fix everything at once because there are not enough replacement parts . As a result the airbags most likely to cause harm are first in line for repair and the lines for existing recalls and others to come may extend for at least a few more years . Given that situation the Federal Trade Commission told General Motors and two dealers in December that it was just fine to advertise used vehicles as certified even if their airbags were under recall and had not been fixed . Just disclose it the agency said ( in a complaint that has sent jaws dropping throughout the auto industry ) . Until early this week every major car company had said that they forbade their dealers from selling certified used vehicles with any open recalls including ones for Takata airbags . On Monday
" Faiz Khalil was a colonel in the Iraqi Army whose work with the United States military may have provoked the killing of his daughter . Mohamed Sharif was a student in Mogadishu Somalia an urban war zone terrorized by rival militias . Both arrived in the United States as refugees through a yearslong process that involved hours of interviews and over a dozen background checks . In late January President Trump signed an executive order to suspend that program after months of claiming that the vetting process needed . The State Department notes that refugees are the most rigorously examined travelers . As the program ’s future hangs in limbo — last weekend refugees began coming in again after a legal challenge to the order — we trace the existing steps .

But the day after Maha disappeared in 2004 he received a call from someone claiming to be from Al Qaeda . The man said that Mr. Khalil had been found out and would have to pay with Maha ’s life .

" In an article that appeared online in The Mail on Sunday a British tabloid the journalist David Rose described “ astonishing evidence ” that the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration in the United States had “ rushed to publish a landmark paper that exaggerated global warming and was timed to influence the historic Paris agreement on climate change . ” “ Exposed : How world leaders were duped into investing billions over manipulated global warming data ” the article ’s headline read . Mr. Rose who has made claims in the past that did not hold up to scrutiny said a “ ” John J. Bates a recently retired scientist at NOAA ’s National Centers for Environmental Information had told him that the agency “ breached its own rules on scientific integrity ” in publishing the study in June 2015 . According to Mr. Rose the study which refuted earlier work that suggested global warming had slowed in the first decade of this century “ was aimed at making the maximum possible impact on world leaders ” at the talks in Paris in December 2015 that led to the agreement by more than 190 nations to set limits on carbon emissions . After Mr. Rose ’s article was published the House Committee on Science Space and Technology and its chairman Representative Lamar Smith Republican of Texas wrote about it on Twitter . Beginning in 2013 scientists published papers showing that according to land and sea surface temperature data the rate of global warming had slowed since the late 1990 s .

" The main reason for the gender gaps at work — why women are paid less why they ’re less likely to reach the top levels of companies and why they ’re more likely to stop working after having children — is employers ’ expectation that people spend long hours at their desks research has shown . It ’s especially difficult for women because they have disproportionate responsibility for caregiving . Flexibility regarding the time and place that work gets done would go a long way toward closing the gaps economists say . Yet when people ask for it especially parents they can be penalized in pay and promotions . Social scientists call it the flexibility stigma and it ’s the reason that even when companies offer such policies they ’re not widely used . A new job search company Werk is trying to address the problem by negotiating for flexibility with employers before posting jobs so employees don ’t have to . All the positions listed on the Werk site including some from Facebook Uber and Samsung are highly skilled jobs that offer some sort of control over the time and place of work . People can apply to jobs that let them work away from the office all the time or some of the time and at hours other than part time or with minimal travel . Another option gives workers the freedom to adjust their schedules no questions asked because of unpredictable obligations like a sleepless night with a toddler or a trip to the emergency room with an older parent . “ Nobody wants to be the female in the department who says ‘ My kid threw up on me this morning I can ’t come in ’ ” said Annie Dean
" He is the most successful and influential investor you have probably never heard of . His writings are so coveted and followed by Wall Street that a used copy of a book he wrote several decades ago about investing starts at $ 795 on Amazon and a new copy sells for as much as $ 3 500 . Perhaps that ’s why a private letter he wrote to his investors a little over two weeks ago about investing during the age of President Trump — and offering his thoughts on the current state of the hedge fund industry — has quietly become the most reading material on Wall Street . He is Seth A. Klarman the value investor who runs Baupost Group which manages some $ 30 billion . While Mr. Klarman has long kept a low public profile he is considered a giant within investment circles . He is often compared to Warren Buffett and The Economist magazine once described him as “ The Oracle of Boston ” where Baupost is based . For good measure he is one of the very few hedge managers Mr. Buffett has publicly praised . In his letter Mr. Klarman sets forth a countervailing view to the euphoria that has buoyed the stock market since Mr. Trump took office describing “ perilously high valuations . ” “ Exuberant investors have focused on the potential benefits of stimulative tax cuts while mostly ignoring the risks from protectionism and the erection of new trade barriers ” he wrote . “ President Trump may be able to temporarily hold off the sweep of automation and globalization by cajoling companies to keep jobs at home but bolstering inefficient and uncompetitive enterprises is likely to only temporarily stave off market forces ” he continued . “ While they might be popular the reason the U. S. long ago abandoned protectionist trade policies is because they not only don ’t work they actually leave society worse off . ” In particular Mr. Klarman appears to believe that investors have become hypnotized by all the talk of policies without considering the full ramifications . He worries for example that Mr. Trump ’s stimulus efforts “ could prove quite inflationary
" BOSTON — During a men ’s hockey game between Boston University and Providence College in early December Brittany Miller sat in the press box near center ice . She tracked statistics and typed notes in her laptop . Across the rink Theresa Feaster kept a close eye on the game logging video of the action . They could have been mistaken for reporters or merely diligent fans . But Miller and Feaster are much more than devoted followers of their beloved teams . They are trailblazers . Last fall Miller and Feaster became the first women to serve as members of an N. C. A. A. Division I men ’s hockey coaching staff when they were hired by their alma maters . But Miller Boston University ’s director of hockey operations and Feaster the coordinator of hockey operations at Providence College say their gender rarely comes up in conversations with coaches or players . “ I ’m just on the staff and come to work every day and work hard ” Feaster said . “ That ’s all there is to it . It ’s not really something that crosses my mind . ” Miller and Feaster had noticed each other during games when they both worked as student managers first as undergraduates and then as graduate students . But they did not formally meet until a meeting of the Hockey East Association the teams ’ conference after both had been hired full time . “ It ’s nice to have someone else who worked hard as a manager and proved herself to her coaching staff ” Miller said . “ It shows that Hockey East is really moving forward in hiring females . ” Each has been around hockey for as long as she can remember though they came to their new jobs from opposite directions . Miller grew up on the ice learning to skate at age 3 and playing competitive hockey through her high school years at Boston Latin School . Feaster did not play but she began learning the game while bouncing around the minors with her father Jay and gained a newfound interest when his job as general manager of the Calgary Flames led to a connection to Providence while she was studying there . Miller who had followed her older brother into the game and was coached by her father started working as a manager at B. U. during the first semester of her freshman year
" Hours before the start of the Women ’s March on Washington on Jan. 21 every Metro car leading to the National Mall was packed so tight that it could take on no more riders . At station after station the train doors would open and the passengers would look out on throngs of fellow protesters — women men children babies the occasional dog — waiting on the platform . As people emerged from underground into the morning air it was hard to tell where to go so they found their way by gauging the human density moving until they reached a spot so full of people that they could no longer move at all . There was an enormous rally happening somewhere in there — activists and celebrities speaking into microphones — but much of the crowd couldn ’t see or hear anything except rumbling waves of cheers . By the time they were meant to march the crowd was so large that it already stretched across the entire route from the rally site near the Capitol to the Ellipse near the White House .

" You never know when a frog playing an electronic game will lead to an experiment on the physics of saliva . But then who even knew that frogs could play electronic games ? So let ’s start with that . Alexis C. Noel a Ph. D. student in mechanical engineering at Georgia Tech and her supervisor David L. Hu were watching a viral YouTube video in which a frog is attacking the screen of a smartphone running an game . It appears to be winning . They started wondering how — in reality — frog tongues stick to insects so quickly when they shoot out to grab them and decided it was a phenomenon worth studying . “ It ’s been an adventure ever since ” Ms. Noel said . First the whole frog tongue slap shot occurs in the blink of an eye requiring Ms. Noel and her colleagues to shoot video of a variety of frogs at the Atlanta Botanical Garden and Zoo Atlanta . Then they ran tests on the saliva itself and the frog tissue . Ms. Noel fondly recalled spending hours at night in the lab scraping tongues from dissected frogs donated by a biology class at the university . “ I needed about a fifth of a teaspoon of saliva ” she said . With data on the speed of the tongue shot and retraction the viscosity — or stickiness — of the saliva and the softness of the tongue tissue they came up with a computer simulation to test their ideas of what was going on . What they found was that frog saliva which is normally 50000 times stickier than human saliva flows freely when it hits an insect . That makes the saliva a fluid which means that the speed at which it flows ( to be precise its shear rate ) changes how viscous it is . In the case of frog saliva the faster it is forced to flow the looser it gets . When the frog tongue hits a cricket
" That was fast . Two weeks after her “ America First ” fashion statement at the inauguration Melania Trump emerged last weekend from the relative seclusion of her life in New York to join her husband at a. k. a. the winter White golf club in Florida . And as far as her sartorial language went America was — well pretty much last . On Friday greeting the president as he disembarked from Air Force One in Palm Beach the first lady wore a short red Givenchy cape dress . On Saturday at a Red Cross ball she wore a long gown from Christian Dior ( both brands connected by the way to LVMH Moët Hennessy Louis Vuitton the French luxury conglomerate led by Bernard Arnault the only foreign luxury mogul to have made a postelection pilgrimage to Trump Tower ) . But on Sunday for a Super Bowl party at Trump International Golf Club she wore leather pants from the Row the brand of Olsen and Ashley Olsen and a thin knit sweater by Derek Lam both names at New York Fashion Week . Does it matter ? On one hand Mrs. Trump has been explicit about her desire to eschew at least for the moment the Washington spotlight . Perhaps her clothes are a part of that
" A fiery meteor streaked across the Midwest sky early Monday morning seen as far west as Nebraska and as far east as New York . Unfortunately for scientists who would like to study where it came from and how it got here ( although perhaps fortunately for people living in the vicinity ) all of the surviving bits of rock plopped into Lake Michigan . The American Meteor Society has received more than 350 reports from witnesses of the green fireball which occurred around 1:25 a. m. local time . William B. Cook a NASA meteor expert reported in a email to NASA headquarters that the fireball originated about 60 miles above West Bend Wis . moving about 38000 miles an hour toward the northeast before disintegrating about 21 miles above Lake Michigan . As the meteor fell apart it emitted sounds that were recorded in the Canadian province of Manitoba about 600 miles away . The blast released energy that was equal to at least 10 tons of TNT Dr. Cook said suggesting that the object that entered the atmosphere was at least 600 pounds and two feet in diameter . Most of the reports came from Wisconsin and Illinois . Michael Hankey of the American Meteor Society said such fireballs happen every day somewhere but only rarely — perhaps four a year — do they occur over populated areas of the United States where the light show can be captured by dashboard cameras security cameras and night owls carrying cellphones . “ There were just a ton of videos ” Mr. Hankey said . “ That was unique . ” Marc D. Fries another NASA scientist said that weather radar captured the shower of meteorites and that he was analyzing the data to estimate the masses of the meteorites and where they fell . From the multitude of reports scientists should be able to calculate the trajectory of the object which most likely originated in the asteroid belt . ( An asteroid is a rock orbiting in the inner solar system usually between Mars and Jupiter . A meteor is the streak of light as an asteroid enters the atmosphere . A meteorite is an asteroid remnant that makes it to the ground . ) Philipp R. Heck a scientist at the Field Museum of Natural History in Chicago
" Donna Hubbard a flight attendant who lives outside Atlanta has no problem speaking forcefully about the issue of human trafficking in the United States . But her voice begins to falter when she talks about her own life — how years of exploitation shattered her confidence and turned her life upside down . “ For many years I couldn ’t talk about being an addict ” she said . “ I couldn ’t talk about being imprisoned . I couldn ’t talk about getting on my feet getting my life back getting my children back . ” She paused to fight back tears . “ I could not talk about that part of me where I was victimized . ” But having realized that airline employees are perfectly positioned to stop human traffickers and their victims in transit Ms. Hubbard has found her mission : teaching other flight attendants to spot and report cases of human trafficking . The nonprofit organization she joined in 2015 Airline Ambassadors International trains workers at airlines and airports how to spot and report cases of human trafficking . It also delivers humanitarian aid around the world and transports sick children who need medical care . It was founded in 1996 by Nancy Rivard who was then a flight attendant . “ We just did it on our own as a public service because we had the personnel ” Ms. Rivard said noting that the organization began focusing on human trafficking in 2009 and has held 52 training sessions in the United States and abroad since 2011 . There were 8042 reported cases of human trafficking in the United States last year — the most ever according to a report released last week by the nonprofit organization Polaris . Most of those came through calls to the National Human Trafficking Hotline which was established by the federal government in December 2007 and is operated by Polaris in a partnership . The number of reported cases has been rising every year since the hotline was established . But it is not all bad news said Bradley Myles Polaris ’s chief executive . “ We don ’t necessarily want to give the impression that just because we ’re learning about more cases the crime is increasing

He ’s not an engineer producer or video director . But he has had a hand in every Grammy — literally — for the past four decades . Known as “ the Grammy man ” Mr. Billings 70 is a master mold maker who has been designing crafting and delivering the awards to the academy for more than half of his life . “ I ’ve been around them forever ” he said in a telephone interview . “ Every year they become more and more special to me . I ’ve always been a music fan and the Grammys have always turned me on to so much I wouldn ’t hear if I just sat and listened to a radio station . ” For this year ’s ceremony airing on Sunday night on CBS 350 trophies were made . And yes they were all created equal . “ When we ’re making Grammys we don ’t know whose Grammy that ’s going to be so we don ’t have one favorite ” Mr. Billings said adding : “ They ’re all just like children . I really never try to question why someone is getting an award I do sometimes question why someone is not . ” Before artists can hoist the award onstage in front of their peers a lot of work must be done which starts when the nomination list comes in .

" If you need a distraction from fighting about “ La La Land ” cheering at “ Hidden Figures ” or weeping about “ Moonlight ” — all of which might have been distracting you from other things — there are 15 movies quietly soliciting your attention along with that of the academy voters . The nominees are often unsung highlights too easily overlooked except for balloting purposes . This is a shame since in about the time it would take to watch “ Arrival ” three times or “ Toni Erdmann ” twice you could take a remarkably tour of world cinema . Even in a generally strong year like this one the shorts display a cosmopolitan breadth and a stylistic variety that the other categories often lack . The animated nominees include handmade as well as digital productions and dark adult themes as well as charm and whimsy . The live action and documentary candidates tackle painful material with compassion courage and imagination ( though sometimes also with conventional sentimentality ) . All of the films arrive in theaters in New York on Wednesday and nationwide on Friday and will be available Feb. 21 on many streaming platforms ( though several can be found on various sites now ) . Here is a brief critical guide . Before it was a mighty fief within Disney ’s Magic Kingdom Pixar was a plucky and resourceful and those roots are often most visible in its nonfeature offerings . This year ’s “ Piper ” ( directed by Alan Barillaro and Marc Sondheimer ) is a technical tour de force of feathers and foam about a fledgling seabird overcoming its fear of water with the encouragement of a firm but loving parent . ( The story is a bit like “ Moana ” in reverse . ) The relationship seems to be a sturdy animation theme figuring in Andrew Coats and Lou ’s “ Borrowed Time ” about a Western lawman dad and his Western lawman son and Patrick Osborne ’s “ Pearl ” ( now on YouTube ) about a rock ’n ’ roll dad and his rock ’n ’ roll daughter . All three of these films show how much can be done without dialogue and offer a respite from the usual cartoon fare that fills up the multiplexes . “ Blind Vaysha ” a film by Theodore Ushev with folkloric Eastern European overtones is a bit talkier with a narrator ’s voice accompanying eerie images . “ Pear Cider and Cigarettes
" The last time we saw John Oliver on “ Last Week Tonight ” the weekly comedy series he hosts for HBO he was blowing up a giant 2016 sign in a soccer stadium bidding farewell to a year that seemed unmatchable in its capacity for tumult and news events . Then 2017 came along . As Mr. Oliver prepares for the premiere of “ Last Week Tonight ” on Sunday he returns to an arena where President Trump the bête noire of the shows has been in charge of the country for nearly a month . During that time the Trump administration has already made the picture more complicated for many issues that Mr. Oliver has addressed in his segments like net neutrality voter fraud torture and nuclear weapons . Now who wants to hear some jokes ? In an interview on Monday at HBO ’s New York offices Mr. Oliver 39 said that despite some clear challenges to his way of looking at the world he did not believe his past work had been in vain . “ I ’m not a complete nihilist ” he said with a laugh . “ I haven ’t quite got to the point where I ’m going ‘ What ’s the point in anything ? Burn it down . ’ ” Though he was mum on the subject of Sunday ’s episode Mr. Oliver said “ Last Week Tonight ” would continue to resist the impulse to go “ all Trump all the time ” and instead try to focus on subjects not addressed by his peers . “ It ’s a lot of people feeding on the same carcass
" WASHINGTON — Senator Jeff Sessions was confirmed on Wednesday as President Trump ’s attorney general capping a bitter and racially charged nomination battle that crested with the procedural silencing of a leading Democrat Senator Elizabeth Warren . Mr. Sessions an Alabama Republican survived a vote 52 to 47 in the latest sign of the extreme partisanship at play as Mr. Trump strains to install his cabinet . No Republicans broke ranks in their support of a colleague who will become the nation ’s top law enforcement official after two decades in the Senate . But the confirmation process — ferocious even by the standards of moldering decorum that have defined the body ’s recent years — laid bare the Senate ’s deep divisions at the outset of the Trump presidency . At the same time the treatment of Ms. Warren who was forced to stop speaking late Tuesday after criticizing Mr. Sessions from the Senate floor rekindled the politics that animated the presidential election and the women ’s march protesting Mr. Trump the day after his inauguration last month . Mr. Sessions cast his final vote as a senator to note that he was present for Wednesday ’s tally . His confirmation was met by applause from his colleagues including a few Democrats on the Senate floor . “ I can ’t express how appreciative I am for those of you who stood by me during this difficult time ” Mr. Sessions said shortly after the vote . “ By your vote tonight I have been given a real challenge . I ’ll do my best to be worthy of it . ” Democrats spent the hours before the vote on Wednesday seething over the rebuke of Ms. Warren of Massachusetts who had been barred from speaking on the floor the previous night . Late Tuesday Republicans voted to formally silence Ms. Warren after she read from a 1986 letter by Coretta Scott King that criticized Mr. Sessions for using “ the awesome power of his office to chill the free exercise of the vote by black citizens ” while serving as a United States attorney in Alabama . Since Mr. Trump announced his choice for attorney general Mr. Sessions ’s history with issues of race had assumed center stage . A committee hearing on his nomination included searing indictments from black Democratic lawmakers like Representative John Lewis of Georgia the civil rights icon and Senator Cory Booker of New Jersey
" WASHINGTON — Republicans seized her microphone . And gave her a megaphone . Silenced on the Senate floor for condemning a peer Senator Elizabeth Warren Democrat of Massachusetts emerged on Wednesday in a coveted role : the avatar of liberal resistance in the age of President Trump . Late on Tuesday Senate Republicans voted to halt the remarks of Ms. Warren already a lodestar of the left after she criticized a colleague Senator Jeff Sessions the nominee for attorney general by reading a letter from Coretta Scott King . Instantly the decision — led by Senator Mitch McConnell the majority leader who invoked a rarely enforced rule prohibiting senators from impugning the motives and conduct of a peer — amplified Ms. Warren ’s message and further inflamed the angry Senate debate over Mr. Sessions ’ nomination . He was confirmed on Wednesday . For Ms. Warren ’s supporters it was the latest and most visceral example of a woman muzzled by men who seemed unwilling to listen . Critics saw something else : a senator who has rankled members of both parties with her nose for the spotlight lobbing a salvo in the next presidential race . “ A lot of that ’s about 2020 politics ” Senator John Thune Republican of South Dakota grumbled on MSNBC . Mr. McConnell ’s subsequent explanation for his maneuver seemed destined for a future Warren campaign ad : “ She was warned . She was given an explanation . Nevertheless she persisted . ” After an unsuccessful effort to draft her for the 2016 presidential race Ms. Warren is considered a very early for 2020 should she run . Mr. McConnell ’s coda has already been repurposed as a sort of rallying cry . Across social media
" WASHINGTON — Judge Neil M. Gorsuch President Trump ’s nominee for the Supreme Court privately expressed dismay on Wednesday over Mr. Trump ’s increasingly aggressive attacks on the judiciary calling the president ’s criticism of independent judges “ demoralizing ” and “ disheartening . ” The remarks by Judge Gorsuch chosen by Mr. Trump last week to serve on the nation ’s highest court came as the president lashed out at the federal appellate judges who are considering a challenge to his executive order banning travel from seven predominantly Muslim countries . The president called their judicial proceedings “ disgraceful ” and described the courts as “ so political . ” Those remarks followed Mr. Trump ’s weekend Twitter outburst in which he derided a Seattle district court judge who blocked his travel ban as a “ judge ” whose “ ridiculous ” ruling would be overturned . Judge Gorsuch expressed his disappointment with Mr. Trump ’s comments about the judiciary in a private conversation with Senator Richard Blumenthal Democrat of Connecticut as he paid courtesy calls on Capitol Hill to build support for his confirmation . An account of the discussion was confirmed by a White House adviser working to advance the Gorsuch confirmation who spoke on condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to comment . The spectacle of a Supreme Court nominee breaking so starkly with the president who named him underscored the unusual nature of Mr. Trump ’s public feud with the judiciary . Speaking to a group of sheriffs and police chiefs on Wednesday the president said the appellate judges had failed to grasp concepts even “ a bad high school student would understand . ” “ This is highly unusual ” said Michael W. McConnell a former federal judge who directs the Constitutional Law Center at Stanford University . “ Mr. Trump is shredding longstanding norms of etiquette and interbranch comity . ” Presidents have traditionally tried to refrain from even appearing to intervene in court cases that concern them or their policies or from impugning the motives and qualifications of jurists charged with deciding them according to judges and legal experts from across the political spectrum . The tradition is important to preserving the separation of powers that is a pillar of American democracy establishing an independent judiciary to serve as a check on the executive branch they argued . Mr. Trump ’s rhetorical battle with the judiciary may also end up harming his cause in a case that may end up before the Supreme Court by potentially stiffening the resolve of judges who feel their independence is under attack . Mr. McConnell called Mr. Trump ’s comments “ extremely and ” because of their potential to sway judges to rule against Mr. Trump . “ Judges who hear criticism of this sort are not going to be inclined to knuckle under it ’s going to stiffen their spines to be even more independent ” said Mr. McConnell who was nominated to his judgeship by President George W. Bush . Jeffrey Rosen the president of the National Constitution Center a nonprofit organization in Philadelphia devoted to explaining the Constitution
" WASHINGTON — Although there is plenty of anxiety in Washington about the shaky early performance of the Trump administration don ’t count Senator Mitch McConnell among the hand wringers . Mr. McConnell a Kentucky Republican and the majority leader says he and his Senate Republican colleagues are quite satisfied with the Trump team so far . In fact he said they are reassured by signs that President Trump is going to hew to a conservative agenda after early fears that the president — a relatively unknown quantity to most elected Republicans — might not really be one of them . “ The country doesn ’t need saving ” Mr. McConnell said when asked during an interview in his Capitol office if there was any cause for a congressional intervention given early chaos in the evolving West Wing . “ I think there is a high level of satisfaction with the new administration ” he said dismissing concerns about dissonant eruptions from the new president and some of his top staff members . “ Our members are not obsessed with the daily tweets but are looking at the results . ” He added : “ No matter what sort of theatrics that go on around the administration if you look at the decisions that are being made they are solid — from our perspective — things that we would have hoped a new Republican president would have done . ” Mr. McConnell has broken with the president on a few subjects taking a much harder line against President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia than Mr. Trump has and objecting to some of the president ’s “ drain the swamp ” initiatives including a proposal for congressional term limits . Other members of the Republican establishment — inside and outside Congress — have expressed growing alarm about the conduct and competence of the White House . But Mr. McConnell whose wife Elaine Chao was named by Mr. Trump as secretary of transportation said things might even be turning out better than anticipated . “ Back during the campaign there were a lot of questions : Is Trump really a conservative ? A lot of questions about it ” Mr. McConnell recalled . “ But if you look at the steps that have been taken so far looks good to me . “ It is the kind of thing we would have expected of one of the others
" WASHINGTON — President Trump lashed out on Wednesday at the Nordstrom department store chain for dropping his daughter Ivanka ’s accessories and clothing line once again raising ethical questions about the relationship between his presidency and his family ’s sprawling business interests . Mr. Trump has already broken with tradition by singling out companies for criticism like Boeing Lockheed Martin automakers and news organizations sometimes causing gyrations in their stock prices and prompting debates about whether corporations would tailor their conduct to suit a bellicose president . But in those cases his ire targeted government contracts departing American jobs or news coverage — not his own family ’s personal fortunes . Six days after Nordstrom announced that based on sales it would no longer carry Ms. Trump ’s products — a decision that prompted some Trump supporters to call for a boycott of the stores — the president took to Twitter to complain that “ Ivanka has been treated so unfairly ” by the company . He first posted the message from his personal account and then it from his official White House account . Mr. Trump ’s complaint also raised questions about how he might handle the moves of numerous other companies as their relationships with Trump brands change . The large national discount retailers T. J. Maxx and Marshalls and Neiman Marcus the luxury department store for example have recently taken steps to give less prominence to Ms. Trump ’s products . Sean Spicer Mr. Trump ’s press secretary said the president ’s tweet was not about business but about “ an attack on his daughter . ” “ For people to take out their concern about his actions or his executive orders on members of his family he has every right to stand up for his family ” Mr. Spicer said . It was not clear if Mr. Spicer was referring to critics of Mr. Trump who have called for a boycott of businesses bearing the family name
2.0"■ A vote on Jeff Sessions ’s nomination as attorney general is expected on Wednesday . ■ A proposed Senate bill would require congressional approval to lift sanctions on Russia . ■ Vice President Mike Pence will attend a Republican Jewish Coalition meeting in Las Vegas . Mr. Trump on Wednesday lashed out at Nordstrom for dropping his daughter Ivanka ’s clothing and accessories line once again raising questions about the tangled relationship between the president and his family ’s business interests . The president has been criticized for singling out other companies for criticism like Boeing and Lockheed Martin prompting gyrations in their stock prices but those controversies had to do with government contracts not his family ’s own fortunes . Nordstrom the department store chain said on Friday that it was dropping the Ivanka Trump line a decision it said was based on sales performance . A campaign using the hashtag #GrabYourWallet which has encouraged shoppers to boycott products with ties to Mr. Trump his family and his donors called the Nordstrom announcement a victory . It was not clear what prompted the president to criticize the company five days later . As Mr. Trump has noted several times federal laws apply to other officials but not to the president . Nordstrom ’s stock dropped briefly after the president ’s Twitter post then rose again . Mr. Trump ’s blast at the company came two days after his wife Melania filed a libel lawsuit describing her “ multiyear term ” as “ one of the most photographed women in the world ” — an apparent reference to her status as a candidate ’s wife and now first lady — as a lucrative business opportunity . A day after her narrow confirmation as education secretary Betsy DeVos toured the department she now leads and delivered a speech to staff members and reporters . She began with a joke : “ This confirmation process and the drama it engendered have been a bit of a bear
" AURORA Colo . — It took 11 days of calling lawyers beseeching immigration officials and trying to book plane tickets but on Tuesday Osman Nasreldin got the love of his life back . His fiancée Sahar Fadul had been detained late last month after arriving at Dulles International Airport from her parents ’ home in Sudan and put on a plane back to Africa the visa it had taken a year for her to acquire stamped “ CANCELLED ” in purple ink . They were reunited on a mild afternoon in Colorado joining a flood of other travelers taking advantage of the temporary suspension of President Trump ’s immigration order restricting the entry of refugees and arrivals from seven largely Muslim countries in the Middle East and Africa . Other couples across the world were still in limbo . “ What does it mean if you live in heaven and don ’t have the person you love ? ” asked Mr. Nasreldin a dental hygienist in Aurora . For couples of different nationalities trying to navigate America ’s immigration system the president ’s executive order and the legal upheaval it created have thrown relationships and marriages into turmoil . Americans with Syrian and Sudanese partners outside the United States are staying up past midnight to buy plane tickets and plan harried reunions while enforcement of the order is still suspended . Legal challenges aside couples of mixed Iranian and American backgrounds are rethinking their plans to build lives together in a country where one partner no longer feels welcome . Engagement parties abroad have been scrapped a wedding dress returned . Mr. Nasreldin and Ms. Fadul were among those racing to reunite hoping to bind themselves together no matter the outcome of federal court cases challenging the legality of Mr. Trump ’s temporary ban . Many of the couples touched by the executive order are accustomed to living apart . They had met online on business trips or on return visits to countries that one or both had left years ago . What changed they said was their certainty they would make it through the immigrant vetting process and one day live together in the United States . “ It ’s all up in the air ” said Guy R. Croteau a psychotherapist in Boston who met his fiancé an Iranian
" Sana Mustafa considers herself “ the privileged one ” in the family . A Syrian refugee who made it to the United States she has a college degree and an apartment in a quiet village in the Hudson Valley . She speaks out freely and without fear about the rights of refugees like herself . “ But I feel so much guilt ” she said . “ My life is moving forward . Their life has been put on hold . ” She means her mother and younger sister Ghena . They live as refugees in a border town in Turkey fearful of saying too much . Ms. Mustafa ’s father was picked up by the Syrian authorities nearly four years ago and hasn ’t been heard from since . Her older sister Wafa fled to Germany . President Trump ’s executive order freezing refugee resettlement also froze her family ’s hopes of living together in the United States . The ensuing legal challenges to the order bring little clarity . About 2000 refugees are expected to come into the country over a period that was to start on Monday . But there are thousands more waiting in line overseas to join family members who are already here like Ms. Mustafa . These families remain suspended in a state of uncertainty — and those who were able to get out say they feel a gnawing sense of guilt . In Knoxville Tenn . an Iraqi woman who arrived five months ago has no explanation to offer her twin daughters who are stranded back home . They cry every time she calls . In Clarkston Ga . a Somali mother fears for her daughter 20 who was supposed to come on Feb. 6 but remains in a refugee camp in Kenya . The family had fled Somalia after gunmen stormed their home and raped and killed another daughter .

" WASHINGTON — Margaret Thatcher famously declared that “ we must try to find ways to starve the terrorist and the hijacker of the oxygen of publicity on which they depend . ” In a speech 32 years ago Mrs. Thatcher the British prime minister facing a threat from the Irish Republican Army said she was not calling for censorship but proposing that “ a voluntary code of conduct ” for journalists might keep them from aiding “ the terrorists ’ morale or their cause . ” It was a statement of a familiar point one made repeatedly in the decades since : that the news media plays a crucial role in amplifying the effect of terrorist violence and giving it exactly the political import the terrorists crave . So for some experts who study terrorism President Trump ’s assertion this week that the news media has actually been ignoring and covering up terrorist attacks came as a surprise . “ It ’s totally astonishing ” said Martha Crenshaw a Stanford scholar who has written on terrorism since the 1970 s . “ It has no basis in fact whatsoever . The criticism has always gone the other way . ” Other experts said Mr. Trump ’s claim had less to do with the facts about terrorism coverage than with the new administration ’s political goals notably defending his executive order that temporarily bans refugees and visitors from some Muslim countries . In the face of the onslaught of legal challenges and outspoken opposition to the order they said the president has an interest in persuading Americans that the terrorist threat from abroad is worse than the news media has revealed . Years of books and articles critiquing the “ symbiosis ” of terrorism and news media coverage have pointed out that terrorists usually seek to promote a political or ideological cause and use spectacular violence with the specific goal of attracting attention . News executives while sometimes expressing mixed feelings about giving terrorists what they seek have generally felt obligated to give such attacks ample coverage . “ It ’s incredible to say that the media does not give enough attention to terrorism ” said David C. Rapoport a retired U. C. L. A. political science professor considered a founder of terrorism studies . He said modern global terrorism arose in the 1880 s in Russia in parallel with and partly owing to the rise of mass daily newspapers . In the United States since the Sept. 112001 attacks even failed terrorist plots often have drawn saturation coverage — think of the fizzled underwear bomb on a airliner on Christmas Day 2009 or the S. U. V. to blow up that produced only smoke in Times Square on a May night in 2010 . Though no target was harmed both attempts drew mountains of coverage
2.0"MOSCOW — A Russian court on Wednesday effectively derailed a presidential run by Aleksei A. Navalny — the only opposition candidate with a broad enthusiastic popular following — by reviving a criminal conviction . The decision by the district court was widely viewed as a move by President Vladimir V. Putin to eliminate his only viable rival in an election scheduled for March 2018 . Although Mr. Putin has been coy about his decision to run for a fourth term there is little question that he will . Some observers had speculated that the president would want a weighty opponent to lend legitimacy to his next victory . The best chance for a competitive race came to a screeching halt on Wednesday however when a district court in the small city of Kirov nearly 500 miles northeast of Moscow pronounced Mr. Navalny guilty of defrauding a state company . Russian law bars anyone with a criminal conviction from seeking elected office . Since he first came to power in January 2000 Mr. Putin and his allies have gone to great lengths to silence or undermine all critical voices in Russia . It has been almost two years since the assassination of Boris Nemtsov another charismatic opposition figure on the doorstep of the Kremlin . His is the most recent in a string of killings of prominent critics — politicians journalists and human rights activists — that remain unsolved . Russian television is largely back under government control as it was during Soviet times along with most formerly independent news agencies . More than 100 nongovernmental organizations working on issues including the environment civic education and fighting the spread of AIDS have been declared “ foreign agents ” forcing many to close . Mr. Navalny was the driving force behind large street protests in 20112012 and 2013 that unnerved Mr. Putin . He has also repeatedly embarrassed senior officials by accusing them of corruption exposing their lavish mansions and other perquisites that seem beyond the reach of a public servant earning a modest government salary . In recent years Mr. Navalny became the prime example of how the government would use the courts to entangle critics . In addition to the conviction revived on Wednesday he has been accused of defrauding a French perfume company and stealing a nearly worthless piece of street art
" DJIBOUTI — The 10:24 a. m. train out of Djibouti ’s capital drew some of the biggest names in the Horn of Africa last month . Serenaded by a chorus of tribal singers the crush of African leaders European diplomats and pop icons climbed the stairs of the newly built train station and merrily jostled their way into the pristine carriages making their inaugural run . “ It is indeed a historic moment a pride for our nations and peoples ” said Hailemariam Desalegn the prime minister of Ethiopia shortly before the train — the first electric transnational railway in Africa — headed toward Addis Ababa the Ethiopian capital . “ This line will change the social and economic landscape of our two countries . ” But perhaps the biggest star of the day was China which designed the system supplied the trains and imported hundreds of engineers for the six years it took to plan and build the line . And the $ 4 billion cost ? Chinese banks provided nearly all the financing . Having constructed one of the world ’s most extensive and modern rail networks at home China is taking its prodigious resources and expertise global . subway cars will soon appear in Chicago and Boston Beijing is building a $ 5 billion rail line in Indonesia and the Chinese government recently christened new rail freight service between London and Beijing . Another ambitious system in the works the Railway Network would link China to Laos Thailand and Singapore . But few places are being reshaped by China ’s overseas juggernaut like Africa a continent that has seen relatively little new railroad construction in a century . Despite years of steady economic growth Africa remains hobbled by an infrastructure deficit according to the Africa Development Bank

2.0"MANILA — A fire raced through a squalid Manila shantytown teeming with people on Tuesday night as residents armed only with buckets of water tried to fight the inferno . As day broke on Wednesday more than 15000 people found themselves homeless bereft of their few worldly possessions and forced to sleep on the Philippine capital ’s streets . “ It spread fast across the neighboring homes made of light materials ” said Wilberto Tiu Manila ’s fire chief . “ Firemen had trouble reaching the area because of small alleyways ” Mr. Tiu said of the warren of closely built homes some constructed of no more than plywood and scrap metal . He said the alleys between homes were too narrow for fire trucks . Residents tried to outrun the blaze grabbing whatever they could carry : pots and pans family pets washing machines and electric fans . Dozens of people were injured in the stampede but miraculously officials said no one was killed . The blaze had been brought under control by Wednesday morning . Fires in the country ’s slums are a regular occurrence . About 1200 families were left without homes in January after a fire in Navotas a suburb of Manila . Residents of shantytowns are at particular risk in the months of February and March as the weather warms and the rains stop officials said . In March 2015

" A man everyone calls Cheese won Somalia ’s presidency on Wednesday and the streets of the beleaguered capital Mogadishu exploded in cheers . Mohamed Abdullahi Mohamed a former prime minister was chosen for the top job capping a electoral process that had been widely criticized as corrupt even by Somali politicians who participated in it . Mr. Mohamed better known in Somalia by his nickname Farmajo ( from formaggio the Italian word for cheese for which his father was said to have acquired a taste when Somalia was an Italian colony ) was considered the protest candidate and less manipulated by foreign interests than the departing president Hassan Sheikh Mohamud . Mr. Mohamed enjoys wide support within Somalia ’s army . The moment his victory was announced celebratory gunfire rang out in Mogadishu as soldiers across the city sprayed bullets into the sky . Mr. Mohamed is rare on the Somali political scene for one reason : He is popular . Crowds of ordinary people poured into Mogadishu ’s streets to cheer and whistle on Wednesday night . As one Somalia analyst put it : The least corrupt and candidate won Somalia ’s most corrupt and least democratic election . Go figure . Somalia which has lurched from crisis to crisis since the central government collapsed in 1991 did not hold direct elections . Instead Western donors helped set up a complicated indirect election in which Somalia ’s regions and its myriad clans subclans and subsubclans chose 329 members of Parliament and those members of Parliament then voted for a president . Western officials thought it too dangerous to hold direct elections because of the persistent threat from the Shabab militant group which has killed thousands across East Africa . On Tuesday the Shabab fired mortar rounds into the area in Mogadishu where the election was being held . Mr. Mohamud the incumbent
" DENVER — The Army approved the construction of the Dakota Access Pipeline on Tuesday paving the way for an infrastructure project that has been surrounded by protest and controversy . Robert Speer the acting secretary of the Army announced the decision to Congress saying he was ready to offer the pipeline ’s owner a easement on a disputed patch of land . The move drew outrage from opponents including the Standing Rock Sioux Tribe whose reservation in North Dakota sits less than a mile from the proposed pipeline route . And it drew cheers from supporters who said the planning process for the completion of the $ 3. 7 billion project had already lasted too long . The chairman of the Standing Rock Sioux Dave Archambault II responded to the decision by vowing to fight it in court . “ As native peoples we have been knocked down again ” he said in statement . “ But we will get back up we will rise above the greed and corruption that has plagued our peoples since first contact . ” The pipeline is set to run under the Missouri River near the reservation . It is opposed by many members of the tribe . Construction of the route has become a global rallying point for environmental and tribal activism drawing thousands of people to a sprawling protest camp and sometimes prompting clashes with authorities . They had objected to the pipeline ’s path running so close to the source of the tribe ’s drinking water noting that any spill could poison water supplies for it and others downstream . Members of the tribe also said the pipeline would cross through sacred ancestral lands . The move comes two weeks after President Trump ordered an expedited review of the pipeline part of his administration ’s goal of supporting fossil fuel development and lowering barriers for major infrastructure initiatives . The project would carry 470000 barrels of oil a day . In the decision Mr. Speer said he would halt the preparation of an environmental impact statement meant to assess the effects of the pipeline adding that he had sufficient information to support approval . The move will allow for the completion of the last mile and a half of the project connecting oil production areas in North Dakota to a crude oil terminal near Patoka Ill . The pipeline is owned by Energy Transfer Partners . The decision prompted immediate outcry from people within the protest camp
" PARIS — Former President Nicolas Sarkozy has been ordered by a judge to stand trial on charges of illegally financing his failed 2012 campaign the Paris prosecutor ’s office said on Tuesday the latest impediment for a politician who not long ago was hoping for a comeback . Mr. Sarkozy 62 a mercurial politician who was president of France from 2007 to 2012 has denied any wrongdoing . His lawyer said he would appeal the decision after which the case would be referred to another court for a final ruling . Mr. Sarkozy who could face up to a year in prison and a fine of 3750 euros or about $ 4 000 is out of the running for presidential elections this spring after a poor showing in a November primary for the center and right candidates and he no longer leads the Republican Party . His diminished role in French politics would limit the fallout from a trial but the judge ’s decision comes amid growing anger against the political establishment and reflects increased scrutiny of its financial and personal arrangements . Mr. Sarkozy would be the second French president since 1958 to go on trial for a financial scandal . Jacques Chirac who was president from 1995 to 2007 was given a suspended sentence in 2011 after being convicted of embezzlement and misuse of public funds when he was mayor of Paris . More recently Christine Lagarde a former economy minister for Mr. Sarkozy who went on to head the International Monetary Fund was convicted in December of negligence for misusing public funds but the court did not impose a fine or a sentence .

" LONDON — In November 1967 four years after her husband ’s assassination Jacqueline Kennedy traveled to the temples of Angkor Wat in Cambodia on a trip with David Ormsby Gore a friend of her husband and himself a recent widower . There was much speculation of a romantic attachment . A few months later Mr. Ormsby Gore a former British ambassador to Washington proposed marriage . She turned him down . In a handwritten letter filled with anguish and a touch of cruelty she explained her decision to marry Aristotle Onassis instead . “ If ever I can find some healing and some comfort — it has to be with somebody who is not part of all my world of past and pain ” she wrote . “ I can find that now — if the world will let us . ” The letter was part of a set of papers found in locked cases discovered only last month in Wales at the family home of Mr. Ormsby Gore who died in 1985 . They are being auctioned in London next month by his grandson to help restore the house . The letters point to the depth of feeling behind the public mask of one of the most celebrated women of her time . Among them is the letter to Mr. Ormsby Gore also known as Lord Harlech dated Nov. 131968 a month after her marriage to Mr. Onassis and five months after the assassination of Robert F. Kennedy . In it Mrs. Kennedy spoke of the love and bond she felt for Mr. Ormsby Gore whose wife had died in a car crash in May 1967 . “ We have known so much shared lost so much together — Even if it isn ’t the way you wish now — I hope that bond of love and pain will never be cut . ” Writing from Mr. Onassis ’ yacht in Greece on stationery with the ship ’s crest a clear if cold message Mrs. Kennedy told Mr. Ormsby Gore : “ You are like my beloved beloved brother — and mentor — and the only original spirit I know — as you were to Jack . ” Mr. Ormsby Gore had expressed incredulity at her choice of Mr. Onassis and she tried to respond . “ Please know — you of all people must know it — that we can never really see into the heart of another

" ATLANTA — What exactly do you do with a work of art mythmaking and Civil War history that is longer than a football field more than 40 feet tall and urgently in need of a new home ? This city is finding out . After decades of deepening disrepair and disinterest in the painting commonly known as the Atlanta Cyclorama workers this month are moving the panorama as part of a $ 35 million plan to rescue and maintain a titanic deteriorating example of an art form that has mostly disappeared . Saving “ The Battle of Atlanta ” which is among the largest oil paintings in the world has proved to be an undertaking of remarkable complexity . It is rife with logistical tests engineering quandaries curatorial challenges and political and racial sensitivities that linger more than 150 years after Gen. William T.

Yet after taxpayers spent years supporting an imperiled painting in a building troubled by leaks and temperature fluctuations formal opposition to the effort which is privately funded by multiple philanthropists is strikingly scarce . “ The fact that this painting has survived when so many others were left out to mold and rot and get burned up and whatever is nothing short of a miracle ” said Gordon L.

Hundreds of athletes from dozens of nations have signed petitions threatened to boycott major events and called for sports authorities to act on evidence that the urine samples of dozens of Russian athletes were tampered with to conceal widespread doping at the last Winter Olympics in Sochi Russia in 2014 . Russian athletes implicated in the Sochi cheating have continued to compete and none have been disqualified by the International Olympic Committee as officials continue further inquiries of their own . “ We will not sacrifice a full and thorough investigation that will be legally scrutinized simply to speed up the process ” Mark Adams a spokesman for the Olympic committee said Tuesday .

" Marissa Alexander no longer wears an ankle monitor . She is now free to go to the park and play basketball with her children in her Jacksonville Fla . neighborhood . She can ride a bicycle and stroll on the beach which she dreamed about in prison . “ I didn ’t carry an umbrella when I first got home ” she said “ because I wanted to feel the rain drops on my skin . ” Ms. Alexander 36 spent almost a years either locked in prison or confined to her house after she was convicted of aggravated assault charges in 2012 for firing a warning shot at her husband who she said had abused her . According to her account in court documents he had threatened her nine days after she gave birth to their daughter . Ms. Alexander was finally freed on Jan. 27 . She plans to take up the fight for domestic abuse victims and push for a change in what advocates have called the uneven application of Florida ’s Stand Your Ground law . She will advocate amending the law in order to take the burden of proof off defendants who have to demonstrate in pretrial hearings that they acted in and deserve immunity from trial .

That led to her trial and ultimate conviction said Faith E.

" Support among American high school students for the First Amendment is stronger today than it has been in the last 12 years according to the latest in a series of large nationwide surveys of the nation ’s rising voters . Some 91 percent of high school students say they believe that individuals should be allowed to express unpopular opinions according to a Knight Foundation survey of nearly 12000 students conducted last year . The survey is the sixth in a series the first of which was carried out in 2004 when 83 percent supported such rights . “ What we ’ve seen since 2004 is a slow but steady increase in support ” said Kenneth Dautrich the study ’s lead author and the president of the Stats Group a statistical and data services firm . Here ’s a look at some of the top findings . High school students may broadly back the First Amendment but not without limits : Their support is tempered depending on the kind of speech and where it ’s delivered . “ While support for the First Amendment as a general concept has never been higher the devil ’s in the details ” said Jonathan Sotsky director of strategy and assessment for the Knight Foundation . percent of the students may support the right to express unpopular opinions in general but only half as many — 45 percent — support that right when the speech in question is offensive to others and made in public . Bullying speech enjoys slightly less backing and students are even less supportive of either kind of speech when it ’s delivered on social media . Many students find little sacred in professional reporting : More than half put as much or more trust in photos videos and accounts shared by individuals online than in traditional news sources . The 726 teachers surveyed however were far more skeptical of the online postings . Students may have faith in firsthand accounts shared online but they are still generally wary of the news they see there . percent said they had “ some ” or “ a lot ” of trust in the information found in newspapers compared with 77 percent for television news and 70 percent for news websites . Just 49 percent reported similar levels of trust in news shared on social media . The survey results suggest that high school students and adults differ greatly in how they consume news . Students are almost twice as likely as adults to “ often ” use mobile devices for news and nearly three times as likely to report “ often ” getting news from social media . Adults are much more likely to report “ often ” getting news from local TV and newspapers . Students are far less concerned about their privacy on the internet than adults according to the survey . But that is changing : In 2016
