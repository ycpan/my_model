content WASHINGTON — Congressional Republicans have a new fear when it comes to their health care lawsuit against the Obama administration : They might win . 
The incoming Trump administration could choose to no longer defend the executive branch against the suit which challenges the administration 's authority to spend billions of dollars on health insurance subsidies for and Americans handing House Republicans a big victory on issues . 
But a sudden loss of the disputed subsidies could conceivably cause the health care program to implode leaving millions of people without access to health insurance before Republicans have prepared a replacement . 
That could lead to chaos in the insurance market and spur a political backlash just as Republicans gain full control of the government . 
To stave off that outcome Republicans could find themselves in the awkward position of appropriating huge sums to temporarily prop up the Obama health care law angering conservative voters who have been demanding an end to the law for years . 
In another twist Donald J. Trump 's administration worried about preserving executive branch prerogatives could choose to fight its Republican allies in the House on some central questions in the dispute . 
Eager to avoid an ugly political pileup Republicans on Capitol Hill and the Trump transition team are gaming out how to handle the lawsuit which after the election has been put in limbo until at least late February by the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit . 
They are not yet ready to divulge their strategy . 
Given that this pending litigation involves the Obama administration and Congress it would be inappropriate to comment '' said Phillip J. Blando a spokesman for the Trump transition effort . 
Upon taking office the Trump administration will evaluate this case and all related aspects of the Affordable Care Act . '' 
In a potentially decision in 2015 Judge Rosemary M. Collyer ruled that House Republicans had the standing to sue the executive branch over a spending dispute and that the Obama administration had been distributing the health insurance subsidies in violation of the Constitution without approval from Congress . 
The Justice Department confident that Judge Collyer 's decision would be reversed After the bullet shells get counted the blood dries and the votive candles burn out people peer down from windows and see crime scenes gone cold : a band of yellow police tape blowing in the breeze . 
The South Bronx just across the Harlem River from Manhattan and once shorthand for urban dysfunction still suffers violence at levels long ago slashed in many other parts of New York City . 
And yet the city 's efforts to fight it remain splintered underfunded and burdened by scandal . 
In the 40th Precinct at the southern tip of the Bronx as in other poor minority neighborhoods across the country people long hounded for infractions are crying out for more protection against grievous injury or death . 
By September four of every five shootings in the precinct this year were unsolved . 
Out of the city 's 77 precincts the 40th has the highest murder rate but the fewest detectives per violent crime reflecting disparities in staffing that hit hardest in some neighborhoods outside Manhattan according to a New York Times analysis of Police Department data . 
Investigators in the precinct are saddled with twice the number of cases the department recommends even as their bosses are called to Police Headquarters to answer for the sharpest crime rise in the city this year . 
And across the Bronx investigative resources are squeezed . 
It has the highest rate of the city 's five boroughs but the thinnest detective staffing . 
Nine of the 14 precinct detective squads for violent crime in the city are there . 
The borough 's robbery squad is smaller than Manhattan 's even though the Bronx has had 1 300 more cases this year . 
And its homicide squad has one detective for every four murders compared with one detective for roughly every two murders in Upper Manhattan and more than one detective per murder in Lower Manhattan . 
In lobbies and family apartments outside methadone clinics and art studios people take note of the inequity . 
They hear police commanders explain that they lack the resources to place a floodlight on a dangerous block or to post officers at a corner . 
They watch witnesses cower behind doors 1.0 When Walt Disney 's Bambi '' opened in 1942 critics praised its spare haunting visual style vastly different from anything Disney had done before . 
But what they did not know was that the film 's striking appearance had been created by a Chinese immigrant artist who took as his inspiration the landscape paintings of the Song dynasty . 
The extent of his contribution to Bambi '' which remains a mark for film animation would not be widely known for decades . 
Like the film 's title character the artist Tyrus Wong weathered irrevocable separation from his mother — and in the hope of making a life in America incarceration isolation and rigorous interrogation — all when he was still a child . 
In the years that followed he endured poverty discrimination and chronic lack of recognition not only for his work at Disney but also for his fine art before finding acclaim in his 90s . 
Mr. Wong died on Friday at 106 . 
A Hollywood studio artist painter printmaker Death may be the great equalizer but it is n't necessarily evenhanded . 
Of all the fields of endeavor that suffered mortal losses in 2016 — consider Muhammad Ali and Arnold Palmer in sports and the Hollywood deaths of Carrie Fisher and Debbie Reynolds — the pop music world had hands down the bleakest year . 
Start with David Bowie whose stage persona — androgynous glam rocker dance pop star electronic experimentalist — was as as his music . 
The year was only days old when the news came that he had died of cancer at 69 . 
He had hinted that his time was short in the lyrics of his final album released just two days before his death but he had otherwise gone to great lengths to hide his illness from the public a wish for privacy that ensured that his death would appear to have come out of the blue . 
Then came another shock about three months later when Prince accidentally overdosed on a painkiller and collapsed in an elevator at his sprawling home studio near Minneapolis . 
Death came to him at 57 and by all indications no one including Prince Rogers Nelson had seen it coming . 
As energetic onstage as ever holding to an otherwise healthy regimen he had successfully defied age into his sixth decade so why not death too ? 
Leonard Cohen on the other hand SEOUL South Korea — North Korea 's leader Kim said on Sunday that his country was making final preparations to conduct its first test of an intercontinental ballistic missile — a bold statement less than a month before the inauguration of Donald J. Trump . 
Although North Korea has conducted five nuclear tests in the last decade and more than 20 ballistic missile tests in 2016 alone and although it habitually threatens to attack the United States with nuclear weapons the country has never an intercontinental ballistic missile or ICBM . 
In his annual New Year 's Day speech which was broadcast on the North 's KCTV on Sunday Mr. Kim spoke proudly of the strides he said his country had made in its nuclear weapons and ballistic missile programs . 
He said North Korea would continue to bolster its weapons programs as long as the United States remained hostile and continued its joint military exercises with South Korea . 
We have reached the final stage in preparations to an intercontinental ballistic rocket '' he said . 
Analysts in the region have said Mr. Kim might conduct another weapons test in coming months taking advantage of leadership changes in the United States and South Korea . 
Mr. Trump will be sworn in on Jan. 20 . 
In South Korea President Park whose powers were suspended in a Parliamentary impeachment on Dec. 9 is waiting for the Constitutional Court to rule on whether she should be formally removed from office or reinstated . 
If North Korea conducts a test in coming months it will test Mr. Trump 's new administration despite years of increasingly harsh sanctions North Korea has been advancing toward Mr. Kim 's professed goal of arming his isolated country with the ability to deliver a nuclear warhead to the United States . 
Mr. Kim 's speech on Sunday indicated that North Korea may a rocket several times this year to complete its ICBM program said Cheong a senior research fellow at the Sejong Institute in South Korea . 
The first of such tests could come even before Mr. Trump 's inauguration Mr. Cheong said . 
We need to take note of the fact that this is the first New Year 's speech where Kim mentioned an intercontinental ballistic missile '' he said . 
In his speech Mr. Kim did not comment on Mr. Trump 's election . 
Doubt still runs deep that North Korea has mastered all the technology needed to build a reliable ICBM . 
But analysts in the region said the North 's launchings of rockets to put satellites into orbit in recent years showed that the country had cleared some key technological hurdles . 
After the North 's satellite launch in February South Korean defense officials said the Unha rocket used in the launch if successfully reconfigured as a missile could fly more than 7 LONDON — Queen Elizabeth II who has been battling a cold for more than a week missed a New Year 's Day church service at her country estate in Sandringham Buckingham Palace said on Sunday . 
A week earlier the queen who is 90 missed a Christmas Day church service for the first time since 1988 because of the illness . 
The Queen does not yet feel ready to attend church as she is still recuperating from a heavy cold '' the palace said in a statement . 
The queen 's husband Prince Philip who had also been ill was well enough to attend both services in the church at Sandringham which is in Norfolk on the east coast of England . 
The queen who ascended to the throne in 1952 became the world 's monarch following the death of King Bhumibol Adulyadej of Thailand in October . 
She is also Britain 's monarch having last year surpassed Queen Victoria 's reign . 
Her mother lived until the age of 101 . '' 
BEIJING — President Tsai of Taiwan sharply criticized China 's leaders on Saturday saying they had resorted to military and economic threats in order to intimidate the island . 
Step by step Beijing is going back to the old path of dividing coercing and even threatening and intimidating Taiwan '' she told journalists in Taipei the capital at a news conference . 
Tensions between Taiwan and China which have been rivals since the Communist Revolution of 1949 intensified in December after Ms. Tsai spoke on the phone with the American Donald J. Trump breaking a longstanding diplomatic practice . 
In recent weeks China has stepped up military activities near Taiwan sending its sole aircraft carrier through the waters near the island and dispatching military planes in the region . 
On Monday Beijing announced that São Tomé and Príncipe an island nation off the west coast of Africa that was one of Taiwan 's fewer than two dozen remaining diplomatic allies had switched its allegiance to the mainland provoking an outcry in Taiwan . 
Despite Beijing 's recent actions which she said had hurt the feelings '' of the Taiwanese people and destabilized relations Ms. Tsai vowed to avoid a confrontation . 
We will not bow to pressure and we will of course not revert to the old path of confrontation '' she said . 
Ms. Tsai faces the delicate task of registering discontent with Beijing while also sending a message that Taiwan will exercise restraint . 
The United States which sees Taiwan as one of its most reliable allies in Asia and has sold billions of dollars of weapons to the island Danny Cahill stood slightly dazed in a blizzard of confetti as the audience screamed and his family ran on stage . 
He had won Season 8 of NBC 's reality television show The Biggest Loser '' shedding more weight than anyone ever had on the program — an astonishing 239 pounds in seven months . 
When he got on the scale for all to see that evening Dec. 8 2009 he weighed just 191 pounds down from 430 . 
Dressed in a and shorts he was lean athletic and as handsome as a model . 
I 've got my life back '' he declared . 
I mean I feel like a million bucks . '' 
Mr. Cahill left the show 's stage in Hollywood and flew directly to New York to start a triumphal tour of the talk shows chatting with Jay Leno Regis Philbin and Joy Behar . 
As he heard from fans all over the world his elation knew no bounds . 
But in the years since more than 100 pounds have crept back onto his frame despite his best efforts . 
In fact most of that season 's 16 contestants have regained much if not all the weight they lost so arduously . 
Some are even heavier now . 
Yet their experiences while a bitter personal disappointment have been a gift to science . 
A study of Season 8 's contestants has yielded surprising new discoveries about the physiology of obesity that help explain why so many people struggle unsuccessfully to keep off the weight they lose . 
Kevin Hall a scientist at a federal research center who admits to a weakness for reality TV Just how is Hillary Kerr the founder of a digital media company in Los Angeles ? 
She can tell you what song was playing five years ago on the jukebox at the bar where she somewhat randomly met the man who became her husband . 
It was These Days '' the version sung by Nico the German made famous by Andy Warhol and the Velvet Underground . 
Actually the song had been playing just before she met Jonathan Leahy now 38 on that December night in 2011 at the 4100 Bar in the Silver Lake district of Los Angeles . 
Ms. Kerr ca n't remember exactly what was playing when they met because at that moment she was jumping up and down like Tigger '' as she put it . 
In answering the usual questions Mr. Leahy told her he was a music supervisor for Girls '' the HBO show created by and starring Lena Dunham . 
That was enough to get Ms. Kerr bouncing . 
Your music has changed my life ! '' 
she told Mr. Leahy . 
Mr. Leahy who is quiet but not shy ( at least he does n't jump up and down upon meeting people ) was mesmerized . 
My main reaction '' he said was it 's a lot easier to talk to beautiful women in a bar when you 're working on a hit show . '' 
They exchanged email addresses more an act of politeness than promise . 
Then their soundtrack went quiet for almost a year . 
Both Mr. Leahy and Ms. Kerr had active social lives but they were focused on their careers . 
Mr. Leahy who grew up in Laconia N. H. graduated from the College of William and Mary in Williamsburg Va. in 2000 and landed in Los Angeles later that year . 
Now he is a music supervisor with Aperture Music and is joined by Manish Raval and Tom Wolfe in being responsible for the music on Girls . '' 
The team has also worked on films including Trainwreck '' and television series such as New Girl . '' 
In addition Mr. Leahy is the music supervisor for Survivor 's Remorse '' on Starz . 
Ms. Kerr grew up in the La Jolla section of San Diego graduated from the University of Southern California in 2000 and eventually made her way to New York Angels are everywhere in the Muñiz family 's apartment in the Bronx : paintings of angels on the wall ceramic angels flanking the ancient VCR angels strumming lyres or blowing little golden trumpets on the bathroom shelves . 
As José and Zoraida Muñiz and their children have struggled to deal with a series of trials and setbacks including cancer debilitating epilepsy deep depression and near eviction it has sometimes seemed as if angels and love were the only forces holding things together . 
Zoraida 's early life in Puerto Rico was like something from a tropical Dickens novel . 
She and her siblings and mother built a house by hand after a hurricane ravaged their home and the children 's father withdrew support . 
Then Zoraida 's grandfather — the father of her absent father — destroyed the house in a rage . 
She was barely a teenager when she met José a Vietnam War veteran . 
With permission from her uncle a judge they were married . 
She was 14 . 
He was 29 . 
They moved to New York in 1983 and started a new life . 
He built boilers . 
She worked in construction using skills she learned as a child and in a clothing store . 
But in 1987 Mr. Muñiz began having violent seizures — eight or 10 a day . 
They did not respond to medication . 
He could no longer work . 
She stopped working to take care of him . 
Still determined to live something like a normal life they started a family . 
Their first child José Jr. had a heart defect . 
By the time he was 2 he had had six operations . 
That 's where the angels came in — the first one was a painting a gift from a cousin . 
When they operated on my son they told me he was an angel because he was supposed to die '' Ms. Muñiz 50 said . 
From there I figured that angels are taking care of me and protecting me and my family . '' 
All the angels are gifts from friends and relatives With Donald J. Trump about to take control of the White House it would seem a dark time for the renewable energy industry . 
After all Mr. Trump has mocked the science of global warming as a Chinese hoax threatened to kill a global deal on climate change and promised to restore the coal industry to its former glory . 
So consider what happened in the middle of December after investors had had a month to absorb the implications of Mr. Trump 's victory . 
The federal government opened bidding on a tract of the ocean floor off New York State as a potential site for a huge wind farm . 
Up up and away soared the offers — interest from the bidders was so fevered that the auction went through 33 rounds and spilled over to a second day . 
In the end the winning bidder offered the federal Treasury $ 42 million more than twice what the government got in August for oil leases — oil leases — in the Gulf of Mexico . 
Who won the bid ? 
None other than Statoil the Norwegian oil company which is in the midst of a major campaign to turn itself into a big player in renewable energy . 
We do not know for sure that the New York wind farm will get built but we do know this : The energy transition is real and Mr. Trump is not going to stop it . 
On a global scale more than half the investment in new electricity generation is going into renewable energy . 
That is more than $ 300 billion a year a sign of how powerful the momentum has become . 
Wind power is booming in the United States with the industry adding manufacturing jobs in the reddest states . 
When Mr. Trump 's appointees examine the facts they will learn that technician is projected to be the occupation in America over the next decade . 
The election of Mr. Trump left climate activists and environmental groups in despair . 
They had pinned their hopes on a Hillary Clinton victory and a continuation of President Obama 's strong push to tackle global warming . 
Now of course everything is in flux . 
In the worst case with a sufficiently pliant Congress Mr. Trump could roll back a decade of progress on climate change . 
Barring some miraculous conversion on Mr. Trump 's part his election can not be interpreted as anything but bad news for the climate agenda . 
Yet despair might be an overreaction . 
For starters THOMPSONS Tex. . 
— Can one of the most promising — and troubled — technologies for fighting global warming survive during the administration of Donald J. Trump ? 
The technology carbon capture involves pulling carbon dioxide out of smokestacks and industrial processes before the gas can make its way into the atmosphere . 
Mr. Trump 's denial of the overwhelming scientific evidence supporting climate change a view shared by many of his cabinet nominees might appear to doom any such environmental initiatives . 
But the new Petra Nova plant about to start running here about 30 miles southwest of Houston is a bright spot for the technology 's supporters . 
It is being completed essentially on time and within its budget unlike many previous such projects . 
When it fires up the plant which is attached to one of the power company NRG 's hulking units will draw 90 percent of the CO2 from the emissions produced by 240 megawatts of generated power . 
That is a fraction of the roughly 3 700 megawatts produced at this gargantuan plant the largest in the Lone Star State . 
Still it is enough to capture 1 . 
6 million tons of carbon dioxide each year — equivalent to the greenhouse gas produced by driving 3 . 
5 billion miles or the CO2 from generating electricity for 214 338 homes . 
From a tower hundreds of feet above the Petra Nova operation the carbon capture system looks like a fever dream of an Erector set fanatic with mazes of pipes and gleaming tanks set off from the main plant 's skyscraping smokestacks and busy coal conveyors . 
Petra Nova uses the most common technology for carbon capture . 
The exhaust stream pushed down a snaking conduit to the Petra Nova equipment is exposed to a solution of chemicals known as amines WEST PALM BEACH Fla. . 
— When Donald J. Trump rang in the new year this weekend he did it in opulence joined by the actor Sylvester Stallone the gossip page fixture Fabio and a crowd of wealthy developers reveling under the swaying palm trees at Mr. Trump 's resort in Palm Beach . 
President George W. Bush had his ranch in Crawford Tex. . 
His father had a compound in Kennebunkport Me . 
President Obama has taken frequent vacations in Hawaii staying at a private home . 
But Mr. Trump 's private club in Florida where he has spent the past two weeks away from his home in New York City is likely to eclipse them all as the 45th president 's winter White House . 
And that was always the intention of Marjorie Meriweather Post the cereal heiress and the property 's original owner who left to the federal government when she died in 1973 hoping it would serve as a home for presidents . 
But the government had no interest in her plan and Mr. Trump later bought the property for less than $ 10 million turning it into a club where membership costs six figures . 
Mr. Trump 's arrival was greeted with sneers by the Palm Beach elite and he opened up 's membership to Jews and who had been excluded from other establishments . 
He was also the first club owner on the island to admit an openly gay couple . 
Since Mr. Trump 's victory in November has been stuffed with guests attracted by an amenity unique to this club : the chance to rub shoulders with the next president . 
It 's like going to Disneyland and knowing Mickey Mouse will be there all day long '' said Jeff Greene a developer and unsuccessful Democratic candidate for the Senate from Florida in 2010 who is a member and was a Hillary Clinton supporter .

Most of the choices we make each day may feel like the products of decision making but they 're not . 
They 're habits . 
And though each habit means relatively little on its own over time the meals we eat how we spend our evenings and how often we exercise have enormous impacts . 
This is particularly true in our 20s when so many of our habits are still up for grabs . 
The patterns you establish right now will impact your health productivity financial security and happiness for decades . 
How much money you make how much time you spend with your friends and family how well your body functions years from now — all of these in many ways are products of the habits you are building today . 
( Related : The 8 health habits experts say you need in your 20s ) And in the last decade our understanding of the neurology of habit formation has been transformed . 
We 've learned how habits form — and why they are so hard to break . 
We now know how to create good habits and change bad ones like never before . 
At the core of every habit is a neurological loop with three parts : A cue a routine and a reward . 
To understand how to create habits — such as exercise habits — you must learn to establish the right cues and rewards . 
In 2002 researchers at New Mexico State University studied 266 individuals most of whom worked out at least three times a week . 
They found that many of them had started running or lifting weights almost on a whim It 's the season for family travel and photos — and perhaps enlarging some of those images of snowy landscapes or tropical getaways to decorate your home . 
There are of course the usual print services and methods . 
You can choose a glossy or matte finish print a photo on canvas or make it into a poster with a few clicks online at photo sites like Snapfish and Shutterfly professional photo shops like Adorama and Mpix or drugstores and chains like Walgreens and Costco . 
But the web is also home to many printing services as well as uncommon surfaces on which to enlarge photos for display be it burlap wood boards acrylic or fabric . 
Why not try some fresh sites and methods ? 
I recently sent some quality iPhone vacation photos to a handful of companies that I 'd never used before and had them enlarged to various sizes and printed on different surfaces . 
I 've also offered some guidance about bulk digitizing those boxes of old travel photos sitting in your closet or basement so that you can begin the New Year if not with a vacation then with a home . 
Of all the ways to turn photos into wall art I was most interested in trying engineer prints named for the large lightweight prints used by architects . 
For less than the cost of a couple of movie tickets you can make huge enlargements . 
Mind you it 's a particular aesthetic one that 's most likely to appeal to people who are after an industrial shabby chic or bohemian look . 
The paper is thin and the lines of the images are softer than a fine art print . 
And engineer prints need not be formally framed . 
People stick them to their walls with washi tape a crafting tape that comes in innumerable colors and prints or they hang the prints using wood poster rails or skeleton clips . 
For a while engineer prints from photos were primarily available in black and white Finally . 
The Second Avenue subway opened in New York City on Sunday with thousands of riders flooding into its polished stations to witness a piece of history nearly a century in the making . 
They descended beneath the streets of the Upper East Side of Manhattan to board Q trains bound for Coney Island in Brooklyn . 
They cheered . 
Their eyes filled with tears . 
They snapped selfies in front of colorful mosaics lining the walls of the stations . 
It was the first day of 2017 and it felt like a new day for a city that for so long struggled to build this sorely needed subway line . 
In a rare display of unbridled optimism from hardened New Yorkers they arrived with huge grins and wide eyes taking in the bells and whistles at three new stations . 
I was very choked up '' Betsy Morris 70 said as she rode the first train to leave the 96th Street station at noon . 
How do you explain something that you never thought would happen ? 
It 's going to change the way everybody lives as far as commuting goes . '' 
It was a major moment for New York 's sprawling transit system after decades of failed efforts to bring the line to one of the few corners of Manhattan the subway did not reach . 
The opening of the first segment of the line — an extension of the Q train to 96th Street — promises to lighten the crush of passengers on the Nos. 4 5 and 6 trains along Lexington Avenue the nation 's most overcrowded subway line which had been the only line on the Upper East Side of Manhattan . 
When the stations opened shortly before noon they were quickly filled with giddy riders both young and old and strollers suitcases and dogs — all familiar sights across the system . 
But for all the excitement the line with just three new stops is much more modest than the ambitious route running the length of Manhattan that was once envisioned . 
It serves a relatively affluent and not very diverse part of the city which has more than eight and a half million people and many and minority residents who live far from a subway line . 
With the subway reaching its highest ridership levels since 1948 much of the aging system is plagued by crowding and delays '' pages into the journal found in Dylann S. Roof 's car — after the assertions of black inferiority the lamentations over white powerlessness the longing for a race war — comes an incongruous declaration . 
I want state that I am morally opposed to psychology '' wrote the young white supremacist who would murder nine black worshipers at Emanuel A. M. E. Church in Charleston S. C. in June 2015 . 
It is a Jewish invention and does nothing but invent diseases and tell people they have problems when they dont . '' 
Mr. Roof who plans to represent himself when the penalty phase of his federal capital trial begins on Tuesday apparently is devoted enough to that proposition ( or delusion as some maintain ) to stake his life on it . 
Although a defense based on his psychological capacity might be his best opportunity to avoid execution he seems steadfastly committed to preventing any public examination of his mental state or background . 
I will not be calling mental health experts or presenting mental health evidence '' he wrote to Judge Richard M. Gergel of Federal District Court on Dec. 16 a day after a jury took only two hours to find him guilty of 33 counts including hate crimes resulting in death obstruction of religion and firearms violations . 
At a hearing on Wednesday Mr. Roof told the judge that he planned to make an opening statement but not call witnesses or present evidence on his behalf . 
The testimony presented by prosecutors during the guilt phase of Mr. Roof 's trial detailed with gruesome precision how he had plotted and executed the massacre during a Wednesday night Bible study in the church 's fellowship hall . 
It was less satisfying in revealing why he had done it . 
With his choice to sideline his legal team and represent himself the second phase — when the same jury of nine whites and three blacks will decide whether to sentence him to death or to life in prison — may prove little different . 
Death penalty experts said it was exceedingly rare for capital defendants to represent themselves after allowing lawyers to handle the initial part of a case . 
Mr. Roof who also faces a death penalty trial in state court has not publicly explained his reasoning . 
But legal filings strongly suggest a split with his defenders about whether to argue that his rampage resulted from mental illness . 
Mr. Roof 's lead lawyer David I. Bruck tried repeatedly to plant that notion during the guilt phase knowing it might be his only chance . 
Because evidence of mitigating factors is supposed to be reserved for the penalty phase MUMBAI India — It was a bold and risky gamble by Prime Minister Narendra Modi of India that quickly seemed to backfire . 
The announcement of a ban on the largest currency bills circulating in India which came into full effect at midnight Friday the last day for depositing the old notes at banks set off cash shortages that have hit the country 's most vulnerable people hard and prompted worries about the economy . 
But despite those concerns as well as doubts about whether the currency ban will reduce corruption as it is designed to do for the moment at least Mr. Modi 's bet appears to be paying off in the public arena . 
Even as the poorest Indians have struggled many have continued to voice support for the prime minister 's initiative to target the vast amounts of untaxed money known as black money '' flowing through the country 's economy in hopes that it will combat an endemic culture of corruption . 
Mr. Modi analysts say has successfully tapped into deep frustration with the corruption that pervades almost every public interface with government . 
Even though the cash ban has produced enormous hardship for me and my family I support what Mr. Modi is doing for our country '' said Hem Raj Chechi 39 a taxi driver in New Delhi the capital BAGHDAD — A suicide bomber detonated a pickup truck loaded with explosives on Monday in a busy Baghdad market killing at least 36 people hours after President François Hollande of France arrived in the Iraqi capital . 
The Islamic State later claimed responsibility for the attack . 
The bomb went off in a produce market that was packed with day laborers a police officer said adding that another 52 people were wounded . 
During a news conference with Mr. Hollande Haider Iraq 's prime minister said the suicide bomber had pretended to be a man seeking to hire day laborers . 
Once the workers gathered around he detonated the vehicle . 
The Islamic State also known as ISIS or ISIL claimed the attack in a statement circulated on a website that is often used by the group . 
It was the third such attack in three days in or near Baghdad underscoring the lingering threat posed by the extremist group despite a string of setbacks for it elsewhere in the country over the past year including in and around the northern city of Mosul . 
The attack took place in Sadr City a vast Shiite district in eastern Baghdad that has been repeatedly targeted by Sunni extremists since the 2003 invasion . 
Militiamen loyal to the Shiite cleric Moktada were seen evacuating bodies in their trucks before ambulances arrived . 
Bodies were scattered across the bloody pavement alongside fruit vegetables and laborers ' shovels and axes . 
A minibus filled with dead passengers was on fire . 
Asaad Hashim 28 an owner of a nearby cellphone store described how the laborers had pushed and shoved around the bomber 's vehicle trying to get hired . 
Then a big boom came sending them up into the air '' said Mr. Hashim who suffered shrapnel wounds to his right hand . 
He blamed the most ineffective security forces in the world '' for failing to prevent the attack . 
An angry crowd cursed the government even after a representative of Mr. Sadr tried to calm them . 
Late last month SYDNEY Australia — The annual beach pilgrimage during the height of summer in Melbourne Australia 's city is threatened by an unsettling phenomenon : shores where the tides are tainted with excrement . 
The Environment Protection Authority in the state of Victoria said on Monday that heavy rains had caused fecal pollution to wash into Port Phillip from rivers creeks and drains . 
It advised against swimming at 21 beaches because of poor water quality . 
It 's poo in all its luxurious forms that is causing the problem '' said Anthony Boxshall the agency 's manager of applied sciences noting that the waste was coming from people dogs horses cows birds and other animals . 
Fecal pollution can cause serious health problems including gastroenteritis . 
Mr. Boxshall said much of the waste had been washed down the Yarra River that runs through Melbourne into Port Phillip affecting the city 's bayside beaches the most . 
The agency which takes regular water samples rates beaches . 
A good '' rating means that the water is suitable for swimming . 
Fair '' means that rainfall has affected the water . 
Poor '' means people should avoid it . 
Residents said that the pollution had deterred them from indulging in a favorite summer ritual . 
When the temperature gets above 86 Fahrenheit Melbournians typically pack the family in the car with food and drink and spend the day at the beach '' said Sam Riley who lives in the city . 
I was going to take my two young boys to the beach myself over the summer but now I 'm concerned about whether the water is clean . '' 
Mr. Boxshall said any improvement in the beaches ' water quality was uncertain as long as the rain continued . 
The agency says it usually takes between 24 and 48 hours for the waters to clear after the rain stops . '' 
When the Green Bay Packers lost to the Washington Redskins in Week 11 dropping to Aaron Rodgers vowed to run the table '' in a march to the playoffs . 
With a victory over the Detroit Lions on Sunday night the team fulfilled Rodgers ' promise . 
Much of the drama of the matchup between division rivals was eliminated earlier in the day when the Redskins lost to the Giants thus guaranteeing both the Packers and Lions would be playoff teams but the N. F. C. North bragging rights and a home game in the first round of the playoffs were sufficient motivation for Green Bay to push hard enough to secure the team 's sixth consecutive win and the third consecutive loss for Detroit . 
Pundits had spent the week deciphering all of the wild scenarios that could play out for positioning among the remaining teams . 
But when all was said and done ten of the teams that were in line for a playoff spot remained in the same seeding order . 
No. 6 Detroit Lions at No. 3 Seattle Seahawks Time : 8:15 p. m. Eastern SATURDAY on NBC The Seahawks ' title hopes took a crushing blow when Earl Thomas was lost for the season with a broken leg . 
After the injury the Seahawks went with the wins coming with major asterisks as they came against the Rams and 49ers . 
That collapse paled in comparison to the Lions who lost their final three games blowing what had been a large division lead against Green Bay . 
Line : Seahawks ( : 43 ) No. 5 Giants at No. 4 Green Bay Packers Time : 4:40 p. m. Eastern SUNDAY on Fox Thanks to playing in the N. F. C. East home of the Dallas Cowboys the Giants managed to tie Atlanta for the record in the N. F. C. but got stuck with the No. 5 seed in the playoffs and a road game against a Packers squad that won its final six games . 
The good news for the Giants is that superstitious fans will note that the last two times they played the Packers on the road in the playoffs they not only won the games but went on to win the Super Bowl both times . 
Line : Packers ( : 44 . 
5 ) Bye weeks : Dallas Atlanta No. 5 Oakland Raiders at No. 4 Houston Texans Time : 4:35 p. m. Eastern SATURDAY on ESPN Line : Texans ( : 37 ) The Texans were the least inspiring of the N. F. L. 's division champions and that was complicated further when Tom Savage whom the team had elevated to starting quarterback after the benching of Brock Osweiler was forced to leave Week 17 's loss to Tennessee with a concussion . 
As bad as that sounds it may still be enough against a reeling Oakland squad that lost Derek Carr to a broken leg in Week 16 Matt McGloin to a shoulder injury in Week 17 and fell all the way from the No. 2 seed in the A. F. C. to No. 5 . 
It is unclear at this point if McGloin or rookie Connor Cook will start at quarterback against Houston . 
No. 6 Miami Dolphins at No. 3 Pittsburgh Steelers Time : 1:05 p. m. Eastern SUNDAY on CBS The Dolphins were a contender when the team 's quarterback Mariah Carey suffered through a performance train wreck in Times Square on New Year 's Eve as malfunctions left her at a loss vocally during her hit song Emotions '' struggling to reach notes and to sync the lyrics and music . 
The trouble continued when she gave up on another of her numbers We Belong Together '' while a recording of the song continued to play a confirmation that she had been . 
But on Sunday a dispute erupted between Ms. Carey 's representatives and producers of ABC 's Dick Clark 's New Year 's Rockin ' Eve With Ryan Seacrest '' on which the singer was performing . 
Ms. Carey 's manager Stella Bulochnikov charged that the show 's producers had been aware of technical problems but did not fix them — and chose to continue showing Ms. Carey 's messy performance to get ratings . '' 
I will never know the truth but I do know that we told them three times that her mike pack was not working and it was a disastrous production '' Ms. Bulochnikov told Us Weekly magazine on Sunday . 
I 'm certainly not calling the F. B. I. to investigate . 
It is what it is : New Year 's Eve in Times Square . 
Mariah did them a favor . 
She was the biggest star there and they did not have their '' act together . 
Dick Clark Productions which produced the show issued a statement on Sunday night saying that Ms. Carey 's performance woes had nothing to do with the production and that any suggestion that the company would ever intentionally compromise the success of any artist is defamatory outrageous and frankly absurd . '' 
In very rare instances there are of course technical errors that can occur with live television '' the statement said adding that an initial investigation suggested that the production company had no involvement in the challenges associated with Ms. Carey 's New Year 's Eve performance . '' 
A veteran audio producer Robert Goldstein of Maryland Sound International a company that has worked on the Times Square event for years PARIS — When the Islamic State was about to be driven out of the ancient city of Palmyra in March Yves Ubelmann got a call from Syria 's director of antiquities to come over in a hurry . 
An architect by training Mr. Ubelmann 36 had worked in Syria before the country was engulfed by war . 
But now there was special urgency for the kind of work his youthful team of architects mathematicians and designers did from their cramped offices in Paris : producing digital copies of threatened historical sites . 
Palmyra parts of it already destroyed by the Islamists who deemed these monuments idolatrous was still rigged with explosives . 
So he and Houmam Saad his Syrian colleague spent four days flying a drone with a robot camera over the crumbled arches and temples . 
Drones with four or six rotors can hover really close and register structural details every crack and hole and we can take very precise measurements '' said Mr. Ubelmann who founded the company Iconem . 
This is the stuff architects and archaeologists need . '' 
They need it in a new push for virtual preservation that scientists archaeologists and others like Mr. Ubelmann are compiling on a large scale . 
The records could be used to create computer models that would show how monuments and endangered historical sites might one day be restored repaired or reconstructed . 
Of special interest today are ancient sites in Syria and also Iraq that have suffered from war Pop music and fashion never met cuter than in George Michael 's Freedom ! ' 
90 '' video . 
Sure other catwalk favorites starred in music videos during that era and fashion photographers like Steven Meisel and Herb Ritts were recruited by stars such as Madonna Chris Isaak and Janet Jackson to burnish their visuals . 
But the convergence of a maker 's irresistible rhythms and lyrics a group of models at the peak of their fame and a director on the verge of his own runaway success gave Freedom ! '

Shot in moody romantic tones Freedom ! ' 
90 '' had been viewed more than 37 million times on YouTube by the time of Mr. Michael 's unexpected death at 53 last Sunday . 
Reached by phone this week some of the participants recalled their experiences on set and some of the video 's most ardent fans reflected on its impact . 
Naomi Campbell WASHINGTON — The most powerful and ambitious Congress in 20 years will convene Tuesday with plans to leave its mark on virtually every facet of American life — refashioning the country 's social safety net wiping out scores of labor and environmental regulations and unraveling some of the most significant policy prescriptions put forward by the Obama administration . 
Even before Donald J. Trump is sworn in on Jan. 20 giving their party full control of the government Republicans plan quick action on several of their top priorities — most notably a measure to clear a path for the Affordable Care Act 's repeal . 
Perhaps the first thing that will happen in the new Congress is the push for deregulation . 
Also up early : filling a Supreme Court seat which is sure to set off a pitched showdown and starting confirmation hearings for Mr. Trump 's cabinet nominees . 
It 's a big job to actually have responsibility and produce results '' said Senator Mitch McConnell of Kentucky the majority leader . 
And we intend to do it . '' 
But as Republicans plan to reserve the first 100 days of Congress for their more partisan goals Democrats are preparing roadblocks . 
The party 's brutal wounds have been salted by evidence of Russian election interference Mr. Trump 's cabinet picks and his taunting Twitter posts . 
( On Saturday he offered New Year 's wishes to all '' including those who have fought me and lost so badly they just do n't know what to do . '' ) 
Obstacles will also come from Republicans who are divided on how to proceed with the health care law and a pledge to rewrite the tax code . 
Some are also skittish about certain policy proposals like vast changes to Medicare that could prove unpopular among the broad electorate . 
And any burst of legislative action will come only if Congress can break free of its longstanding tendency toward gridlock . 
For Republicans the path to this moment has been long and transparently paved — the House in particular has signaled the Republican policy vision through bills it has been passing for years . 
But many of those measures have gathered dust in the Senate or been doused in veto ink . 
The cleft between the two chambers recalls the situation faced by the insurgent House Republican majority in the . 
Speaker Newt Gingrich took control with a determined agenda only to be stymied by the Senate majority leader Bob Dole who stacked conservative House bills like so many fire logs in the back of the Senate chamber . 
They 've been given a golden opportunity here WASHINGTON — It 's or time for Republicans . 
After a tumultuous decade that has seen profound changes in the makeup and character of their party Republicans are poised to complete their slow but steady climb back to power as they seize control of the House Senate and the White House for the first time since 2006 . 
That political triad will leave them with a splendid opportunity for success . 
But there is little room for failure if they hope to satisfy their impatient constituents and deliver on bold promises to reshape the nation 's health care delivery system restructure the tax code drive job creation muscle up American foreign policy rebuild a crumbling infrastructure and set America on a new course . 
Republicans who will take command of the Senate and House as the 115th Congress convenes on Tuesday have long been itching for a chance to do it their way constantly grousing that President Obama and Congressional Democrats held back American progress and economic growth . 
Now they must show they can deliver . 
And they know it . 
When you have both houses and the presidency there is no acceptable excuse for not passing major legislation '' said Representative Tom Cole a senior Republican from Oklahoma . 
There is a lot of pressure on Republican members to produce and to produce quickly . '' 
That will not be easy . 
There is a mutual wariness between many Republicans in Congress and Donald J. Trump leaving it unclear how often their interests and priorities will coalesce or collide . 
Some of the biggest fights might well be between Republicans on Capitol Hill and the White House occupied by a man who campaigned against the establishment and some of the very Republicans running Congress . 
Republicans must also maneuver while facing slightly expanded Democratic minorities in the House and Senate in a climate that is in many respects even more hostile than it was before the November elections . 
Democrats remain angry at how Republicans treated President Obama including their refusal to consider the nomination of federal Judge Merrick B. Garland to the United States Supreme Court . 
Democrats want payback for the cold shoulder given to Mr. Garland 's nomination to satisfy themselves and to show their supporters that they are not going to roll over for the new Republican government . 
While they can not employ the filibuster to block most nominations they still retain it for Supreme Court picks and legislation — at least for now . 
Perhaps most important Republicans themselves are going to need something of an attitude adjustment . 
The contemporary Republican Party has been built out of fierce opposition to Mr. Obama and deep disdain for activist government . 
Nearly of current House Republicans have never served with a Republican president and their entire time in Washington has been spent fighting the executive branch . 
As a result Republicans have had the luxury of being able to argue for positions that appealed to their conservative base but that they knew would not become law because Senate Democrats would block them or because the president would veto them . 
Now if they can assemble the votes their ideas will become law — with all the attendant consequences . 
Republicans who have shied from the responsibility of government will now be called upon to support increases in the debt limit 1.0 Good morning .

[ The New York Times ] • Suicide bombers struck the international airport in Mogadishu The body of the Iraqi prisoner was found naked and badly bruised in 2003 outside a detention center in southern Iraq run by United States Marines . 
The man had been beaten deprived of sleep forced to stand for long periods and interrogated by Marines about his alleged role in a fatal ambush of American forces . 
James N. Mattis Donald J. Trump 's nominee for secretary of defense was then a major general and the commander of the Marine division in Iraq responsible for the center . 
He quickly convened an inquiry into the death which led to and banned the harsh techniques used at the prison . 
General Mattis was all up in arms over this '' Ralph Dengler then a lieutenant colonel testified at a military hearing in January 2004 . 
He added that the commander who arrived hours after the discovery on a planned visit with his British counterpart had immediately described the death as the worst thing that happened '' under his watch in the Iraq war . 
I was surprised that he would have felt that strongly about it considering many of the other deaths including American deaths '' Colonel Dengler said . 
Colleagues say the general 's handling of the episode reflects his firmly held views against torture and prisoner mistreatment which are shared by many military leaders and could put them at odds with the new commander in chief . 
Mr. Trump in a New York Times interview in late November said he had been surprised to learn that the man he was considering to lead the country 's 2 .

Give me a pack of cigarettes and a couple of beers ISTANBUL — The Islamic State on Monday issued a rare claim of responsibility for an attack in Turkey after a New Year 's Day shooting at an Istanbul nightclub that killed at least 39 people describing the gunman who carried out the assault — and who has not been identified or captured — as a hero soldier of the caliphate . '' 
The Turkish authorities are still searching for the gunman who killed a police officer guarding the Reina nightclub before going on a shooting rampage with a rifle but the state news media reported that eight suspects had been detained in connection with the attack . 
The authorities on Monday released two photographs of the person suspected of being the gunman captured by security cameras that showed a cleanshaven man in a dark winter coat . 
The government 's spokesman Numan Kurtulmus said at a news conference that investigators believed they found the assailant 's fingerprints and that they were close to identifying him . 
Mr. Kurtulmus did not mention the Islamic State specifically but he said Turkey would press the fight against terrorism . 
Referring to the attack which happened just after midnight on Sunday morning Mr. Kurtulmus said : The fact that it was done during the first minutes of 2017 gives an important message . 
The message is ` We will go on to menace Turkey in 2017 . ' 
And we say to them we will break into your caves wherever you are . '' 
The Turkish newspaper Hurriyet reported on Monday that the gunman might be from Kyrgyzstan or elsewhere in Central Asia . 
The Russian news agency Interfax quoted Aiymkan Kulukeyeva a spokeswoman for the Foreign Ministry in Kyrgyzstan as saying According to preliminary information this information is doubtful but we are checking all the same . '' 
The Islamic State asserted in a statement that the attack had been carried out in continuation of the blessed operations that the Islamic State is conducting against Turkey the protector of the cross . '' 
A hero soldier of the caliphate attacked one of the most famous nightclubs where Christians celebrated their pagan holiday '' read the statement from the Islamic State WASHINGTON — President Obama 's advisers wrestled with an intractable problem in the spring and summer of 2015 : How could they stabilize Afghanistan while preserving Mr. Obama 's longtime goal of pulling out the last American troops before he left office ? 
As it happened the president solved the problem for them . 
In early August of that year when Mr. Obama convened a meeting of the National Security Council he looked around the table and acknowledged a stark new reality . 
The fever in this room has finally broken '' the president told the group according to a person in the meeting . 
We 're no longer in mode . '' 
What Mr. Obama meant was that no one in the Situation Room that day himself included thought that the United States — after 14 years of war billions of dollars spent and more than 2 000 American lives lost — would ever transform Afghanistan into a semblance of a democracy able to defend itself . 
At the same time he added the counterterrorism challenges are real . '' 
As bleak as Afghanistan 's prospects were the United States could not afford to walk away and allow the country to become a seedbed for extremists again . 
A few weeks later the president halted the withdrawal and announced that he would leave thousands of American troops in the country indefinitely . 
It was a crucial turning point in the evolution of Barack Obama . 
The antiwar candidate of 2008 who had pledged to turn around Afghanistan — the good war '' to George W. Bush 's bad war '' in Iraq — had conceded that the longest military operation in American history would not end on his watch . 
The optimistic president who once thought Afghanistan was winnable had through bitter experience become the commander in chief of a forever war . 
He remains defensive about the lessons of that journey . 
We should n't assume that every time a country has problems that it reflects a failure of American policy '' the president said in an interview in September . 
Now as Mr. Obama prepares to turn the war over to Donald J. Trump a leader even more skeptical than he is about the value of American engagement in foreign conflicts Afghanistan captures the disillusionment of a man who believed as he put it in his 2009 Nobel Peace Prize acceptance speech With the year winding down and New Year 's resolutions just around the corner it 's time to gear up for that clutter purge . 
But the thought of tackling the kitchen junk drawer — or even taking down the decorations — can be overwhelming . 
So to help motivate you several organizing professionals offered tips on how to streamline your closets beat back the toys taking over the living room and yes finally deal with that junk drawer . 
START WITH THE HOLIDAY TRAPPINGS To keep plastic ornaments and Hanukkah candles organized use small containers you already have on hand like popcorn and cookie tins or empty shoeboxes and egg cartons . 
Wrap fragile ornaments in leftover tissue paper or newspaper or invest in storage containers like archival ornament boxes from the Container Store . 
For strings of lights and garlands use zip ties to avoid tangles and put them in plastic bags labeled according to use ( tree lights porch lights balcony bushes etc. ) . 
Zip ties can also be used on wreaths so that they can be hung on coat hangers and covered with plastic garment bags from the dry cleaner . 
To avoid a stockpile of holiday cards save only those that are meaningful and special '' Tova Weinstock a professional organizer in Brooklyn said . 
For the others appreciate them as you receive them and then kindly send them to the trash . ''

Mr. Netanyahu was questioned under caution '' the police said in a statement implying that there were grounds to suspect that Mr. Netanyahu might have committed a criminal offense . 
No further details can be given at this stage '' the statement added . 
The Ministry of Justice said late Monday that Mr. Netanyahu had been questioned by investigators from Lahav 433 a police fraud investigation and prosecution unit with the authorization of the attorney general Avichai Mandelblit . 
In a detailed statement the ministry described how the police had gathered testimony from dozens of witnesses some abroad and seized documents during a monthslong graft inquiry . 
While some aspects of the inquiry did not yield evidence of crimes the statement said other parts warranted a deeper investigation . 
Mr. Netanyahu who has been subject to police inquiries and investigations in the past that ended without charges has vehemently denied any impropriety . 
This will all come to nothing because there is nothing '' he has said repeatedly of the latest accusations . 
Local news outlets say the investigators are focused on two separate cases one more serious than the other but they have offered little detail on the more serious one . 
The less weighty one according to reports in the newspaper Haaretz and other outlets concerns favors for Mr. Netanyahu and possibly for members of his family PARIS — If the world does not envy the French enough already for their generous vacations universal health care and fine food and wine the arrival of 2017 brings this : a newly created right to disconnect .

Though ridiculed in some quarters as a ban on email after hours it is not quite that . 
But it is born of the enlightened view that it is actually beneficial for people not to work all the time and that workers have the right to occasionally draw the line when their employer 's demands intrude on evenings at home treasured vacations or Sundays with friends and family . 
Employees are more and more connected during hours outside of the office '' Myriam El Khomri the minister of labor said last year in justifying the need for the law . 
The boundary between professional and personal life has become tenuous '' and cases of burnout are becoming more prevalent she said . 
The measure is one of a raft of new laws that took effect with the beginning of the new year and that exemplify the search for compromises between preserving French traditions and making concessions to the realities of the modern world . 
The new provision in the labor law does not ban emails but does require that companies with more than 50 employees negotiate a new protocol to ensure that work does not spill into days off or hours . 
Some consultants have recommended that employees and managers avoid the reply all '' function on emails to groups so that only one person is being asked to read an email and respond rather than half the office . 
Another approach recommends setting a time each evening after which employees are not expected to reply — several firms have designated the 10 hours between 9 p. m. and 7 a. m. others the 12 hours between 7 p. m. and 7 a. m . 
As a country with Catholic roots but also a commitment to personal liberties France has had an ambivalent approach to divorce . 
It has long been legal but not necessarily speedy . 
A new nod to modernity in French laws eases the rules for people who want to divorce . 
While historically France has been far more flexible than Ireland or Italy it still required a judge to rule on each divorce . 
The procedure routinely took as long as a year and sometimes far longer because cases were backed up awaiting the judicial signature . 
Now if both members of the couple agree on the divorce 1.0 OTTAWA — It was 7 a. m. and 99 passengers and six crew members were aboard a 737 on the tarmac at Calgary International Airport bound for a sunny holiday in Cancun Mexico . 
There was one problem however . 
The flight 's captain was passed out in the cockpit apparently from drinking . 
The police in Calgary Alberta arrested the pilot Miroslav Gronych 37 on Saturday and have charged him with two offenses . 
This is a new one and obviously this had a very significant potential to cause great harm had the pilot actually been allowed to fly this plane '' Staff Sgt. Paul Stacey of the Calgary Police Service said at a news conference . 
There 's just so many checks and balances it just does n't surprise me that he got caught before this plane was able to leave the gate . '' 
Nevertheless Inspector Ken Thrower the commander of the Calgary Police Service 's traffic and airport unit said his officers along with airport officials and inspectors from Transport Canada the aviation regulator will begin trying to figure out how the pilot managed to pass through several checkpoints RIO DE JANEIRO — A prison riot involving gangs vying for supremacy over the cocaine trade in the Brazilian Amazon left at least 56 people dead the authorities in the city of Manaus said on Monday . 
Riots at Brazil 's prisons are common but the episode in Manaus which involved decapitated bodies being thrown over the walls of the penitentiary ranks among the bloodiest in recent decades . 
Officials expressed dismay over the scenes of slaughter in the Compaj prison which held more than 1 200 inmates about triple its official capacity . 
I never saw anything like this in my life '' Judge Luís Carlos Valois who helped negotiate an end to the riot said in a Facebook post . 
He said that dozens of people had been killed but that it was challenging to arrive at a precise count : There were lots of bodies . 
Many of them were dismembered . '' 
The riot flared on Sunday and lasted about 17 hours raising fears of even greater violence on the streets of Manaus the largest city in the Amazon basin with a population of about 2 . 
1 million . 
Manaus has emerged as a brutal battleground between two prison gangs that are contesting control of the drug trade in the region . 
The authorities said that one of the gangs Familia do Norte ( Family of the North ) which operates from the Manaus prisons was responsible for the vast majority of the killings during the riot . 
The targets were from First Capital Command a much larger rival gang commonly known by its Portuguese initials P. C. C. which has its roots in the prisons of São Paulo in southeast Brazil . 
There were deaths only on one side '' Sérgio Fontes the top security official in Amazonas State told reporters . 
The Familia do Norte massacred members of the First Capital Command After the explosion in September of one of its rockets SpaceX is now ready to get back into the business of sending payloads to space the company announced on Monday with its next rocket headed to orbit as soon as Sunday . 
In a statement SpaceX — or more formally Space Exploration Technologies Corporation — said that an investigation had determined the likely cause : an unexpected interplay of supercold helium and oxygen with carbon fibers and aluminum . 
The statement Monday added technical details about what went wrong and the company said it had devised workarounds to prevent a recurrence . 
The cascade of explosions on Sept. 1 that destroyed a Falcon 9 rocket on the launchpad at Cape Canaveral Air Force Station in Florida was perplexing and concerning because it occurred during what is usually regarded as a safer portion of operations — the fueling of propellants — about eight minutes before the ignition of the engines for a planned test . 
( The launch had been scheduled for two days later . ) 
The trouble appeared to start near the liquid oxygen tank on the second stage of the rocket and in less than a tenth of a second that section was in flames followed by the destruction of the entire rocket and a $ 200 million communications satellite whose customers included Facebook which had planned to use it to expand internet services in Africa . 
Under current federal laws investigations into such explosions are led by the company that built the rocket not by a government agency . 
The investigation panel included representatives of the Federal Aviation Administration the United States Air Force NASA and the National Transportation Safety Board . 
Falcon 9 rockets are used to carry NASA cargo to the International Space Station and are to provide transportation for astronauts beginning in 2018 . 
SpaceX is also competing to win contracts to launch Department of Defense spy satellites . 
With few obvious clues to the explosion the company initially considered hypotheses like sabotage that a sniper had fired a shot rupturing the oxygen tank from the roof of a competitor 's building nearby . 
The accident investigation team worked systematically through an extensive fault tree analysis '' SpaceX said in its statement . 
The investigation narrowed in on three helium containers within the liquid oxygen tank . 
The containers consist of an aluminum liner with an outer layer of strong carbon fibers . 
During launch as the liquid oxygen is consumed the helium is heated and released to maintain pressure within the tank . 
In December 2015 In the basement of a mammoth old building in Upper Manhattan that houses the Yeshiva University High School for Boys sits a cramped gym that is home to the high school 's floor hockey team known as the Lions . 
The school calls the gym the Lions ' Den but many visitors call it the Dungeon and liken playing there to playing hockey inside a box . 
Games are raucous affairs with rough play and frenzied fans squeezed onto the narrow bleachers at one end between the squads of panting players . 
Several miles away in the Riverdale neighborhood of the Bronx is the comparatively luxurious indoor rink at the Salanter Akiba Riverdale High School known as S. A. R. With its sturdy boards and rounded sides the rink resembles a real ice hockey surface . 
Its scoreboard is flanked by American and Israeli flags . 
Between these two extremes exists the but thriving world of interscholastic floor hockey at yeshiva high schools in New York City and surrounding towns . 
The game in these Orthodox Jewish private schools stretches back at least to the late 1970s but in recent years it has grown enormously popular . 
The championship match can fill an arena with as many as 1 000 fans with more people watching live online . 
Players in elementary grades at Jewish schools now set their sights on yeshivas with the most powerful hockey programs . 
Outside the Orthodox community this is a foreign thing '' said Amir Gavarin 22 a former floor hockey league player . 
But inside it 's a whole world unto itself and supercompetitive . '' 
The teams play in the Metropolitan Yeshiva High School Hockey League which includes 18 varsity and 15 junior varsity teams for boys . 
There are also 12 girls ' teams which play in the spring season . 
The game is similar to ice hockey but played on foot on a gym floor with a hard orange ball and squads made up of a goalie and four roaming players . 
Goalies wear full padding Writers are different from the rest of us . 
Their castoff scraps can be worth money not to mention the obsessive attentions of future scholars . 
Jonathan Lethem 52 recently became the latest author to sell his personal paper trail to a major archive . 
The Beinecke Rare Book Manuscript Library at Yale University acquired a trove of his manuscripts letters notes and other artifacts which will now sit alongside material from Walt Whitman Sinclair Lewis James Baldwin and Marilynne Robinson in its rich American literature collection . 
Mr. Lethem 's papers contain items relating to the novels that made him something of a reluctant patron saint of Brooklyn 's literary ascendance including Motherless Brooklyn '' ( 1999 ) and The Fortress of Solitude '' ( 2003 ) . 
But as befits a lifelong collector music obsessive comics geek and dedicated chronicler of underground culture there are also cartoons New York 1970s ephemera and what is surely the largest cache of drawings of vomiting cats in any university collection . 
For an author who is so much fun as a novelist it 's interesting to see there is so much fun in his archival documents as well '' said Melissa Barton the curator of American prose and drama at the Beinecke . 
( Ms. Barton citing library policy declined to say what Yale paid in the sale which was arranged by the Manhattan book dealer Glenn Horowitz . ) 
Mr. Lethem 's archive also includes two computer hard drives a laptop and other digital materials In 2007 Rey Canunayon and his wife MaryGwen immigrated to the United States from the island of Mindanao in the Philippines . 
In doing so they were fulfilling their family 's dreams . 
For years her parents had requested that the Canunayons join them in New York City . 
But her parents died before that could happen . 
Mr. Canunayon felt remorse about not honoring their wishes while they were alive . 
Still he and his wife wanted to embark on the adventure and make the move . 
America is a great nation a kind nation a nation of greener pastures and milk and honey and endless possibilities '' Mr. Canunayon said . 
When the couple arrived they stayed with Ms. Canunayon 's family in New Jersey . 
Life was exciting even relaxing Mr. Canunayon said . 
But as they settled in a new country he struggled to find work and grew despondent .

When you come from a place where you are so familiar your own country 1.0 WASHINGTON — It was supposed to be a triumphant morning for Republicans on Capitol Hill — a moment to demonstrate the merits of unified party rule in the age of Donald J. Trump . 
By noon party leaders had a message for their charges : It was not going smoothly . 
The day after House Republicans voted to eliminate an independent ethics body members returned to work on Tuesday to find their offices inundated with angry missives from constituents amid a national uproar . 
By midmorning Mr. Trump had weighed in questioning the members ' priorities on Twitter . 
Shortly after lawmakers were summoned to the basement of the Capitol for a hastily convened meeting with Republican leaders . 
Representative Kevin McCarthy of California the majority leader — who along with Speaker Paul D. Ryan had opposed the proposal — lobbed a pointed question at his fellow Republicans according to two people present : Had they campaigned on repealing the Affordable Care Act or tinkering with an ethics office ? 
Minutes later members emerged to say the changes had been scrapped . 
The reversal came less than 24 hours after House Republicans meeting in a secret session voted to curtail the powers of the Office of Congressional Ethics an independent body created in 2008 after a series of scandals involving House lawmakers including three who were sent to jail . 
It was part of a turbulent opening for the Trump era in Washington marked by a Republican push in the Senate to repeal the Affordable Care Act . 
House Republicans led by Representative Robert W. Goodlatte of Virginia had sought on Monday to prevent the office from pursuing investigations that might result in criminal charges .

The virtual currency is worth about $ 1 WASHINGTON — The Congress opened the turbulent Trump era in Washington on Tuesday as the new Senate moved instantly to begin the repeal of President Obama 's signature health care law while the House descended into chaos in an attempt to gut an independent congressional ethics office . 
On a day usually reserved for pomp constitutionally mandated procedure and small children parading around in fancy dresses Congress instead pitched itself into partisan battles . 
Speaker Paul D. Ryan easily won but not before the embarrassment of having his members defy him by voting to eliminate the ethics office only to then abandon that effort after a flood of criticism from constituents and Twitter messages from Donald J. Trump that criticized House Republican priorities . 
It was a rocky start to a period in which Republicans had promised an end to Washington gridlock if they controlled both Congress and the White House . 
There was intraparty conflict and a sense that Mr. Trump who ran against the Republican establishment would continue to be openly critical of his own party at times . 
As Democrats in both chambers seethed Senator Mitch McConnell of Kentucky the majority leader unveiled the legislative language that could decimate the Affordable Care Act before the crocuses start to bloom in the spring even if any replacement of the law could take years . 
Budget language released on Tuesday gives House and Senate committees only until Jan. 27 to produce legislation that would eliminate major parts of the health care law . 
Under arcane budget procedures that legislation would be protected from a Democratic filibuster and could pass the Senate with a simple majority . 
And debate will begin on Wednesday before senators have even moved into their new offices . 
The dueling over the health law 's fate will pull in both the departing and incoming White House administrations as well . 
On Wednesday Mr. Obama will visit with congressional Democrats to plot how to resist the planned repeal and Mike Pence the vice will meet with Republicans to gird them for the fight ahead . 
While the Senate action showed Republicans on course to keep campaign promises the House got off to a messy start brought on by Republicans who had moved largely in secret on Monday to gut a congressional ethics office against Mr. Ryan 's wishes . 
That provoked an outcry from both Democrats and voters who flooded House offices with angry calls . 
Every organization is calling my office '' said Representative Pete Sessions Republican of Texas . 
And we 've told them : ` Thank you very much . 
We appreciate your feedback . 
''' After a hastily called meeting on Tuesday morning among Republicans the matter was dropped before it could go to the full House floor for a vote . 
As the Senate moved to larger legislative matters WASHINGTON — Donald J. Trump on Tuesday named as his chief trade negotiator a Washington lawyer who has long advocated protectionist policies the latest sign that Mr. Trump intends to fulfill his campaign promise to get tough with China Mexico and other trading partners . 
Mr. Trump also renewed his episodic campaign to persuade American companies to expand domestic manufacturing criticizing General Motors via Twitter on Tuesday morning for making in Mexico some of the Chevrolet Cruze hatchbacks it sells domestically . 
Hours later Mr. Trump claimed credit after Ford said it would expand vehicle production in Flat Rock Mich. . 
The choice of Robert Lighthizer ( pronounced ) to be the United States ' trade representative nearly completes Mr. Trump 's selection of top economic advisers and taken together with the 's running commentary on Twitter underscores Mr. Trump 's focus on making things in America . 
That is causing unease among some Republicans who regard Mr. Trump 's views on trade as dangerously retrograde even as they embrace the bulk of his economic agenda . 
Mainstream economists warn that protectionist policies like import taxes could impose higher prices on consumers and slow economic growth . 
But some Democrats are signaling a readiness to support Mr. Trump . 
Nine House Democrats held a news conference Tuesday with the A. F. L. . 
I. O. president Richard Trumka to urge renegotiation of the North American Free Trade Agreement with Mexico and Canada . 
We wanted him to know that we 'll work with him on doing that '' Mr. Trumka said . 
I do n't think he has enough Republican support to do it and rewriting the rules of trade is a necessary first step in righting the economy for working people . '' 
Mr. Trump and his top advisers on trade including Mr. Lighthizer share a view that the United States in recent decades prioritized the ideal of free trade over its own . 
They argue that other countries are undermining America 's industrial base by subsidizing their own export industries while impeding American importers . 
They regard this unfair competition as a key reason for the lackluster growth of the economy . 
In picking Mr. Lighthizer who has spent much of the last few decades representing American steel producers in their frequent litigation of trade disputes Mr. Trump is seeking to hire one of Washington 's top trade lawyers to enforce international trade agreements more vigorously . 
He must be confirmed by the Senate . 
He will do an amazing job helping turn around the failed trade policies which have robbed so many Americans of prosperity '' Mr. Trump said in a statement . 
Mainstream Republicans have sought common ground with Mr. Trump emphasizing for example '' ■ Donald J. Trump appears to side with the WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange over United States intelligence agencies with Vice Mike Pence backing him up . 
■ She 's hired : Omarosa Manigault gets a White House post as do some notable Trump loyalists . 
But Mr. Trump is leaning on Republican veterans in the Oval Office 's top slots . 
■ The finds something very strange '' about his intelligence briefing on Friday — even though the White House says it was always planned for Friday . 
For the Republican Party Mr. Assange the WikiLeaks founder was once purely a villain . 
He found little sympathy with conservatives after he leaked American military secrets from Iraq published purloined diplomatic cables that could have gotten American sources killed and sought refuge in the Ecuadorean Embassy in London fleeing charges of rape . 
But now Mr. Trump appears to be siding with Mr. Assange over the conclusions of America 's intelligence services . 
Mr. Assange appeared on Fox News on Tuesday night with Sean Hannity one of Mr. Trump 's biggest news media boosters to declare once again that the Russians were not the source of the purloined emails that WikiLeaks released from the Democratic National Committee and the personal account of Hillary Clinton 's campaign chairman John Podesta . 
Mr. Trump followed that appearance with a series of Twitter posts on Wednesday that appeared to be preparing his followers for battle once more information on intelligence findings was released most likely by Thursday . 
There were actually two separate hackings that the Obama administration has said came from Russian intelligence — with 100 percent '' certainty . 
As he has previously Mr. Assange said : Our source is not the Russian government . 
It is not state parties . '' 
But Mr. Assange has often said that the organization does not always know the identity of its sources . 
It is highly unlikely that anyone approaching WikiLeaks with the emails obtained by Russian government hacking would acknowledge the source so it is likely that Mr. Assange can not be sure of the origin of the emails . 
Mr. Assange and Mr. Hannity did not address that in addition to WikiLeaks the leaked Democratic material was published by two mysterious websites DCLeaks . 
com and a blog written by someone called Guccifer 2 . 
0 . 
American intelligence agencies say they believe both were created by Russian agents . 
In addition to American intelligence agencies most private researchers also say they believe that the D. N. C. and Podesta hackings were carried out on orders of Russian government officials though a few skeptics say they believe the case is unproven by the evidence made public . 
Mr. Assange 's statement is unlikely to change that conclusion . 
Intelligence officials will brief Congress on their Russia inquiry on Thursday LOS ANGELES — Girding for four years of potential battles with Donald J. Trump Democratic leaders of the California Legislature announced Wednesday that they had hired Eric H. Holder Jr. who was attorney general under President Obama to represent them in any legal fights against the new Republican White House . 
The decision by the Legislature to retain Mr. Holder who is now a prominent Washington lawyer is the latest sign of the ideological battle that may play out over the next four years between this predominantly Democratic state and Washington . 
Hillary Clinton the Democratic candidate for president defeated Mr. Trump by more than four million votes here . 
Having the former attorney general of the United States brings us a lot of firepower in order to prepare to safeguard the values of the people of California '' Kevin de León the Democratic leader of the Senate said in an interview . 
This means we are very very serious . '' 
Mr. de León said he expected California to challenge Washington — and defend itself from policies instituted in Washington — on issues including the environment immigration and criminal justice . 
He said California Democrats decided to turn to Mr. Holder as they watched Mr. Trump assemble his cabinet and begin to set the tone for his presidency . 
It was very clear that it was n't just campaign rhetoric '' Mr. de León said of Mr. Trump 's proposals over the past year . 
He was surrounding himself with people who are a very clear and present danger to the economic prosperity of California . '' 
Mr. Trump did not immediately return requests for comment . 
The move by Mr. de León and his Democratic counterpart in the Assembly Anthony Rendon follows Gov. Jerry Brown 's appointment of Representative Xavier Becerra as attorney general last month to succeed Kamala D. Harris who was elected to the United States Senate . 
That appointment made Mr. Becerra one of the Latino officials in this state and he is expected to be instrumental in battling with the Trump White House over any attempt to enforce stringent measures aimed at immigrants . 
Mr. Brown has made clear that he intends to challenge the administration on global warming and that his attorney general will be a key to that battle . 
The Democratic Party controls of both the Assembly and the Senate in California . 
Every statewide elected official is a Democrat . 
Mr. Holder was Mr. Obama 's attorney general from 2009 to 2015 . 
He was the first to hold that position . 
He is a partner at Covington Burling a law firm in Washington that specializes in representing states and companies against the federal government . 
I am honored that the Legislature chose Covington to serve as its legal adviser as it considers how to respond to potential changes in federal law that could impact California 's residents and policy priorities '' Mr. Holder said in a statement . 
I am confident that our expertise across a wide array of federal legal and regulatory issues will be a great resource to the Legislature . '' 
The Legislature has an ample stable of lawyers on staff but officials said Mr. Holder and his firm brought specific litigation and political skills that could be needed in the coming years . 
Mr. de León said the final compensation for the firm had not been set JERUSALEM — The fate of just one Israeli soldier was hanging in the balance . 
But for many Israelis the guilty verdict announced on Wednesday was a critical turn in the battle for the character of the state . 
When the military judges convicted Sgt. Elor Azaria of manslaughter for shooting a Palestinian assailant in the head as he lay wounded on the ground they were ruling not just on his conduct but also on the host of ethical and political issues it raised . 
Since the shooting in the occupied West Bank city of Hebron in March the case has polarized Israelis and rocked the pedestal on which the military normally stands . 
With the 50th anniversary of Israel 's occupation of the West Bank approaching the highly charged trial had fueled a debate about military ethics and the place of the army in Israeli society . 
The verdict did little to heal the rifts the trial had exposed : Hours after it was rendered Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu joined a chorus of voices calling for the soldier to be pardoned . 
This is a difficult and painful day for us all '' Mr. Netanyahu said in a Facebook post supporting a pardon which can be granted by Israel 's president or the army 's top officials . 
Referring to the Israel Defense Forces he added The soldiers of the I. D. F. are our sons and daughters and they need to remain above any dispute . '' 
Prof. David Enoch an expert in the philosophy of law at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem said he thought the manslaughter conviction was justified '' but added I 'm not sure this verdict will be welcomed by many of the soldiers and much of the public . '' 
The military 's rules make clear that assailants must be quickly incapacitated but that once the threat is neutralized they should not be killed . 
Rights groups and other critics have accused Israeli soldiers and police officers of being too quick to pull the trigger particularly in response to a recent spate of deadly stabbings shootings and car attacks by Palestinians . 
The Hebron killing caught in chilling completeness in a video that quickly went viral worldwide for many critics crystallized the question of excessive force and even military leaders said Sergeant Azaria acted without justification . 
But in Israel Stuck at your work desk ? 
Standing up and walking around for five minutes every hour during the workday could lift your mood combat lethargy without reducing focus and attention and even dull hunger pangs according to an instructive new study . 
The study which also found that frequent brief walking breaks were more effective at improving than a single longer walk before work could provide the basis for a simple realistic New Year 's exercise resolution for those of us bound to our desks all day . 
There is growing evidence of course that long bouts of uninterrupted sitting can have undesirable physical and emotional consequences . 
Studies have shown that sitting motionless reduces blood flow to the legs increasing the risk for atherosclerosis the buildup of plaques in the arteries . 
People who sit for more than eight or nine hours daily which for many of us describes a typical workday also are at heightened risk for diabetes depression and obesity compared with people who move more often . 
In response researchers and some bosses have proposed a variety of methods for helping people reduce their sitting time at work including standing workstations and treadmill desks . 
But such options are cumbersome and costly making them impractical for many work situations . 
Some experts have worried too that if people are physically active at the office It 's that time of year when financial advice sites issue their lists of the Stocks to Buy for 2017 . '' 
Before you take them up on their suggestions let 's look at how well such portfolios did in 2016 . 
The portfolios of stocks they were telling you to buy generally did much worse than the stock market over all . 
The results underline what many personal finance experts recommend : Invest in a broad mutual index fund . 
( The Times 's Your Money '' columnist wrote more on this here . ) 
In 2016 the broad S. P. stock index increased 9 . 
5 percent . 
But if you invested in Forbes 's 2016 list your money grew about 7 percent . 
Kiplinger 's was about half that . 
A list that appeared on the Money magazine site garnered 4 . 
9 percent and Barron 's returned 5 . 
3 percent . 
One such list at CNBC did a little better than most at 10 . 
6 percent . 
But Vanguard 's Total Stock index fund returned 12 . 
5 percent in the same period . 
We even calculated these returns by assuming that any of the dividends were reinvested but still none beat the widely owned index fund . 
There is nothing wrong with these lists if you are using them as mere suggestions of what companies might be worth investigating . 
There were some bona fide winners on almost every list : Goldman Sachs Kennametal Ellie Mae Douglas Dynamics Burlington Stores . 
You might not have heard of some of those companies so it 's not a bad place to look for ideas . 
But the problem with such lists is that they encourage people to approach investing the wrong way . 
Unsophisticated investors are being persuaded that they should own a sheaf of stocks . 
But as you can see even when the stocks are recommended by professional money managers and filtered through some of the best financial journalists they do n't do as well as the averages . 
The best advice remains the same : If you have money you want to play with go have some fun with a few stocks that you can monitor closely . 
If you keep it simple it 's easier to track and respond . 
But for the rest of us the smart investment is those index funds . 
They cost less than stocks or other funds . 
They remove most of the emotion from your decision making which is the cause of a lot of bad decisions . 
That 's your best bet in 2017 . '' 
For Megyn Kelly the shift from Fox News to NBC — where she will host a daily daytime show and a Sunday newsmagazine program — will be a test of whether she can connect with a broader audience in a different format and reach another level of television stardom . 
But her move announced Tuesday has broader implications for the television news industry raising new questions about the future of Fox News where she was a countervailing presence in an opinion lineup heavy with ideology and of NBC News which has been a longtime bête noire for conservative press critics . 
And it comes as all news organizations gird for a new era of media coverage that arrives Jan. 20 with the inauguration of Donald J. Trump . 
The Murdoch family which controls Fox News 's parent company 21st Century Fox had become so invested in Ms. Kelly as a franchise that they were prepared to pay her a salary of more than $ 20 million a year . 
People inside and outside the network widely took that to mean the Murdochs were staking the network 's future on a journalist who effectively made her name by upending the expectations for a Fox News anchor — for instance by publicly taking on the Republican nominee for president . 
But now Fox News long the cable news ratings leader and an influential voice in the national political debate is on course to begin coverage of a new administration with no anchor with Ms. Kelly 's history of challenging Mr. Trump . 
Her show The Kelly File '' was sandwiched between the program of Bill O'Reilly — she was regularly second to him in the cable news ratings — and that of Mr. Trump 's major booster Sean Hannity . 
Her departure coming after that of Greta Van Susteren also means that Fox faces the prospect of having no female host in prime time . 
That is a potentially troubling development for the network as its seeks to move past last summer ` s sexual harassment scandal involving its and former chairman Roger Ailes Megyn Kelly 's new office at NBC News sits a block north of Fox News headquarters in Midtown Manhattan . 
But it might as well be a world away . 
In switching networks at a pivotal point in her career Ms. Kelly the No . 
personality in cable television news is taking a calculated risk that she can swap her dedicated Fox audience for the broader but more fickle viewership of network television . 
There are challenges from the . 
Her splashy arrival has the potential to fray nerves among the big personalities at the network — who already compete against one another for interviews and scoops . 
Ms. Kelly 46 will also be taking on a daytime talk show format that has been a virtual graveyard for television news personalities in the last 10 years . 
And the new Sunday newsmagazine show that NBC plans to build around Ms. Kelly will go up against a giant that has not been meaningfully challenged for decades : 60 Minutes '' on CBS . 
Still Ms. Kelly is a bona fide star with a book and a breakout role in this year 's presidential campaign when she clashed with Donald J. Trump . 
NBC News comes out the winner in one of the most closely watched talent sweepstakes in years acquiring one of television 's biggest names who could play a role in any number of major network events like coverage of elections or the Olympics . 
Interviews on Tuesday with network executives and producers — from Fox NBC and other rival channels — suggest that Ms. Kelly 's performance at NBC will be as closely watched in the industry as her past few months of contract negotiations . 
Ms. Kelly will have to design her daytime talk show from scratch . 
Even though she made her name as a news anchor she has argued that she is not obsessed with politics . 
When she hosted a special on Fox in May — her first major foray outside cable news — she expressed a desire to combine the qualities of Oprah Winfrey Barbara Walters and Charlie Rose . 
That special — which featured interviews with Mr. Trump the celebrity lawyer Robert Shapiro and the actress Laverne Cox — received middling reviews . 
It was far from a ratings hit : Among adults younger than 50 the demographic most important to broadcasters Ms. Kelly 's special performed about as well as ABC 's Beyond the Tank '' a spinoff . 
A daily daytime talk show also poses risks . 
talent like Jane Pauley Meredith Vieira Katie Couric and Anderson Cooper have taken a stab at the genre in the past QINGYUAN China — The 48 soccer fields of the vast Evergrande Football School in south China seem barely enough for its 2 800 students . 
Against a backdrop of school spires that seem modeled on Hogwarts the young athletes swarm onto the fields nearly every day kicking dribbling and passing in the hope of soccer glory and riches . 
Soccer will be my career after I grow up '' Wang Kai a gangly who has studied at the boarding school for over three years said after a morning session under the supervision of a Spanish coach . 
I want to be the Chinese Cristiano Ronaldo '' he said referring to the Portuguese superstar . 
Grooming the next Ronaldo or Messi has become a national project in China where the country 's No. 1 fan President Xi Jinping is bent on transforming the country into a great soccer power . 
It is a moonshot for China whose teams have ranked poor to middling in recent international competition . 
But the effort has already unleashed a surge of spending and support for the game that has stunned fans and players around the world . 
In the last two weeks the main Chinese league has plucked foreign stars from Europe and South America with contracts reported to be worth as much as $ 40 million a year the highest pay for any soccer player in the world . 
A Chinese club offered the real Ronaldo $ 105 million a year but he declined his agent said last week . 
These giddying sums are shaking the landscape of pro soccer . 
Antonio Conte the manager of England 's fabled Chelsea team denounced the Chinese spending spree last month as a danger for all teams in the world . '' 
The drive to match China 's economic ascent with success on the soccer field has become emblematic of Mr. Xi 's ambition to transform China into a great and confident power . 
My biggest hope for Chinese soccer is that its teams become among the world 's best In the technology industry the sharks have never long been safe from the minnows . 
Over much of the last 40 years the biggest players in tech — from IBM to to Cisco to Yahoo — were eventually outmaneuvered by that came out of nowhere . 
The dynamic is so dependable that it is often taken to be a kind of axiom . 
To grow large in this business is also to grow slow blind and dumb to become closed off from the very sources of innovation that turned you into a shark in the first place . 
Then in the last half decade something strange happened : The sharks began to get bigger and smarter . 
Nearly a year ago I argued that we were witnessing a new era in the tech business one that is typified less by the storied in a garage than by a posse I like to call the Frightful Five : Amazon Apple Facebook Microsoft and Alphabet Google 's parent company . 
Together the Five compose a new superclass of American corporate might . 
For much of last year their further rise and domination over the rest of the global economy looked not just plausible but also maybe even probable . 
In 2017 much the same story remains but there is a new wrinkle : The world 's governments are newly motivated to take on the tech giants . 
In the United States Europe Asia and South America the Five find themselves increasingly arrayed against legal and regulatory powers and often even against popular will . 
The precise nature of the fights varies by company and region BEIJING — A city official in southwest China unleashed a barrage of gunfire on the city 's mayor and Communist Party secretary during a meeting on Wednesday injuring them before fleeing and killing himself the official news media reported . 
Privately owned guns are rare in China because of a virtual ban on civilian use and grisly attacks on officials by colleagues are also uncommon . 
So rumors of the shooting in Panzhihua an industrial city in Sichuan Province rippled quickly across the Chinese internet even before the local authorities confirmed the news . 
Panzhihua was built as part of Mao 's plans to relocate factories deep inland where they would be protected from a feared war . 
But the violence in this isolated site was nonetheless an embarrassing breach of the efforts by China 's president Xi Jinping to remake officialdom into a clean impeccably disciplined bureaucracy . 
Details were sparse and there were no clues to the gunman 's motives . 
But the brief initial report in the state media sketched a scene of the head of the Panzhihua Land and Resources Bureau Chen Zhongshu bursting into a meeting at an exhibition center and opening fire on officials there . 
The gunman stormed into the meeting fired repeatedly at the main leading comrades of the city party committee and government and then fled '' said an online report by Sichuan Daily an official provincial newspaper citing the Panzhihua government press office . 
The suspect in the shooting Mr. Chen was found dead in the exhibition center . 
He had taken his own life A steep drop in gang violence last year drove shootings in New York City to the lowest number in at least a Police Department data shows a result of what police officials say has been a focus on gang takedowns and targeted arrests in some of the city 's roughest neighborhoods . 
The internal police data obtained by The New York Times paints a detailed portrait of the motives locations and circumstances behind murders and shootings for the last two years . 
shootings fell to 412 in 2016 from 560 the year before according to the data which tracked shootings and murders through Dec. 28 of each year . 
killings dropped to 79 in 2016 from 129 in 2015 . 
Those helped push citywide shootings to a new low of 998 by year 's end police officials said down from 1 138 in 2015 . 
Murders also fell to 335 from 352 the year before . 
The New York City police commissioner James P. O'Neill has noted the department 's efforts to push shootings below 1 000 for the first time since at least the early 1990s when the police began keeping similar records . 
Mr. O'Neill and Mayor Bill de Blasio were expected to discuss those efforts at a news conference in Brooklyn on Wednesday . 
Scores of gang takedowns this year resulting in about 900 arrests took violent people off the streets and made it more costly to engage in crimes police officials said . 
Precision policing targets those people who are responsible for the violence Our new president is a billionaire Ivy League graduate a real estate tycoon a TV star and a son of inherited wealth . 
But he is no longer by his own calculations a member of the elite . '' 
Nor are the men ( and the few women ) now joining his inner circle — and corporate executives Harvard and Yale alumni Silicon Valley entrepreneurs and Goldman Sachs bankers . 
The true elite apparently sits elsewhere among those who in Sarah Palin 's notable 2008 formulation think that they 're — I guess — better than anyone else . '' 
As an adjective the word elite '' still conveys something positive even aspirational : elite athlete elite model elite travel services . 
But as a noun embodied by actual living people it has become one of the nastiest epithets in American politics . 
Elites have taken all the upside for themselves and pushed the downside to the and Americans '' complains Trump 's adviser Steve Bannon ( of Harvard Goldman Sachs and Hollywood ) . 
In this formulation elites are a destructive condescending collective plotting against the beleaguered masses outside their ranks . 
And in these attacks '' Will you marry me ? '' 
Hundreds of thousands of potential grooms and brides pop that question every year and yet the logistics of delivering that momentous phrase — where to do it when to do it and how much of a surprise should it be — remains among the most important decisions anyone planning on getting married has to make . 
Some of the couples whose wedding announcements were featured in the pages of The New York Times this past year or whose weddings The Times learned about got engaged in unusual spots — from a Manhattan rooftop to a subway construction site below the city 's streets — and one proposal even involved seeking advice from President Obama . 
And of course at least several can now be found on YouTube .

She dreams of opening a dance studio in the Bronx . 
Ms. Rivera grew up in the Bronx with a mother who could not afford to send her to dance classes . 
But she loved dancing in front of the family 's television as they watched the variety show Sábado Gigante . '' 
And you see these kids dancing and you see me dancing in the living room too '' Ms. Rivera said . 
I used to wear my mom 's makeup her heels . '' 
Ms. Rivera passed on her love of dancing to her children WASHINGTON — Congress opened for battle over the Affordable Care Act on Wednesday as Republicans pushed immediately forward to repeal the health care law and President Obama made a rare trip to Capitol Hill to defend it . 
The bitterness that has long marked the fight intensified as Republicans seized the opportunity to make good on a central campaign promise to get rid of the law a pledge reinforced on Wednesday by Vice Mike Pence who met with House Republicans not far from where the president gathered with Democrats . 
The Affordable Care Act Mr. Obama 's signature health care law has created online insurance marketplaces offered new protections to people seeking health insurance and provided coverage to millions of people near the poverty line through expanded Medicaid . 
Health policy experts say that system could collapse if Republicans cut off funds for the expanded coverage and end penalties for people who go without health insurance . 
The American people voted decisively for a better future for health care in this country '' Mr. Pence said and we are determined to give them that . '' 
He said that Donald J. Trump would use his executive authority to help make the transition away from the health care law but did not offer specifics . 
Democrats vowed aggressive resistance however and said they would not participate in drawing up a replacement for the law after the swift efforts to unravel it . 
Senator Chuck Schumer of New York the new Democratic leader playing off Mr. Trump 's campaign slogan said repealing the law would make America sick again . '' 
Republicans are using a procedural approach that will allow them to repeal substantial parts of the health care law without Democrats ' being able to mount a filibuster in the Senate . 
By a vote of 51 to 48 on Wednesday the Senate took the first step agreeing to take up a budget resolution or blueprint that would clear the way for legislation repealing major provisions of the law . 
But even as Republicans spoke of moving quickly to repeal the law it remained far less clear how and when they would go about replacing it . 
Senate debate on the budget resolution is expected to continue for several days and the House plans to take up the measure once the Senate has approved it . 
As Republicans charged ahead WASHINGTON — Republicans hope to repeal major parts of the Affordable Care Act using an expedited procedure known as budget reconciliation . 
The process is sometimes called arcane but it has been used often in the past 35 years to write some of the nation 's most important laws . 
Reconciliation is probably the most potent budget enforcement tool available to Congress for a large portion of the budget '' the Congressional Research Service a nonpartisan arm of Congress has said . 
Here is a primer . 
Q . 
What is the budget reconciliation process ? 
A . 
It is a way for Congress to speed action on legislation that changes taxes or spending especially spending for entitlement programs like Medicare and Medicaid . 
Although conceived primarily as a way to reduce federal budget deficits it has also been used to cut taxes and to create programs that increase spending — changes that can raise deficits . 
In the Senate a reconciliation bill can ordinarily be passed with a simple majority . 
For other bills a majority is often needed to limit debate and move to a final vote . 
Q . 
Why is it called reconciliation ? 
A . 
The term originated in the Congressional Budget and Impoundment Control Act of 1974 which was intended to give Congress more control over the budget process by allowing lawmakers to set overall levels of spending and revenue . 
The process begins with a budget blueprint a resolution that guides Congress but is not presented to the president for a signature or veto . 
It recommends federal revenue deficit debt and spending levels in areas like defense energy education and health care . 
The resolution may direct one or more committees to develop legislation to achieve specified budgetary results . 
By adopting these proposals Congress can change existing laws so that actual revenue and spending are brought into line with — reconciled with — policies in the budget resolution . 
Q . 
How has reconciliation been used ? 
A . 
Since 1980 Congress has completed action on 24 budget reconciliation bills . 
Twenty became law . 
Four were vetoed . 
The Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1981 was a vehicle for much of the Reagan revolution . '' 
It squeezed savings out of Social Security Medicare Medicaid food stamps the school lunch program WASHINGTON — Majorities in Congress often overreach but usually not on the very first day . 
House Republicans on the verge of a Washington takeover as the new Congress convened Tuesday could n't stop themselves from trying to dilute the power of a despised ethics watchdog as their first order of business . 
In the process they created an unsightly spectacle that pretty much ruined an celebration of unified Republican government undermined their own leadership and perhaps foretold the shape of things to come . 
House Republicans take a stand on a contentious issue Donald J. Trump turns to Twitter to break with House Republicans then Republicans frantically reverse course . 
Mr. Trump campaigned that he was going to drain the swamp and here we are on Day 1 trying to fill the swamp '' Representative Walter B. Jones Republican of North Carolina said after he and his colleagues hurriedly jettisoned a plan seen as a brazen attempt to weaken an independent ethics office that some felt had been unfair to lawmakers . 
That is not a good way to start . '' 
Deluged by angry phone calls and bad headlines chagrined Republican officials say they were well on their way to abandoning the ethics revisions adopted Monday night in a party meeting before Mr. Trump weighed in via Twitter and suggested that the overhaul should n't be a top priority urging Republicans to focus instead on taxes and health care . 
But the final decision did come after the 's Twitter posts underscoring his sway over House Republicans who had moved ahead despite objections and warnings about the optics of the change from Speaker Paul D. Ryan and Representative Kevin McCarthy of California the majority leader . 
House Republicans might have amusedly applauded Mr. Trump 's cutting tweets when they were aimed at the news media and other common foes but they found them measurably less funny when the criticisms were directed their way raising alarms among Republicans about his power to corral them via social media . 
Following the decision to reverse course several lawmakers were quietly fretting that Mr. Trump 's megaphone was much more powerful than they had realized . 
Other Republicans both on and off Capitol Hill were wondering how the proposal got as far as it did given the stated reservations of Mr. Ryan and Mr. McCarthy among others . 
They said it did not bode well that the rank and file was so willing to ignore leadership on such a potentially critical matter WASHINGTON — Ivanka Trump who is weighing a prominent role in her father 's administration is planning to move with her family to a mansion in the exclusive Kalorama section of Washington two people familiar with the decision said Wednesday . 
The house was previously owned by a financier with extensive investments in Russia and ties to a Russian opposition leader . 
Ms. Trump and her husband Jared Kushner a close adviser to Donald J. Trump who is expected to be an influential voice in the administration have chosen a house just around the corner from President Obama 's new home . 
The newly renovated house with its sleekly modern décor sold for $ 5 . 
5 million in December the people said insisting on anonymity because the transaction was private . 
The home was previously owned by Dan K. Rapoport and his wife Irina according to property records filed with the District of Columbia . 
Neither responded to emailed requests for comment . 
Ms. Trump 's relocation plans first reported by Washingtonian magazine are the latest evidence that she and Mr. Kushner will remain major players in Mr. Trump 's administration . 
Both played crucial roles in his presidential bid and have wielded outsize power during his transition . 
People close to the couple declined to comment on their impending move as did William F. X. Moody a at Washington Fine Properties who first disclosed the deal . 
But in the neighborhood where they are planning to live — of ambassadors and prominent figures on the Washington social circuit — residents have been buzzing about their neighbors . 
Everybody 's atwitter about it '' said Tony Podesta chairman of the Podesta Group a top Washington lobbying firm . 
I 've been getting lots of emails saying The Wall Street lawyer Walter J. Clayton does not travel in political circles nor is he well known in corporate America . 
He is the insider 's insider — a deal maker . 
As such his nomination to lead the Securities and Exchange Commission is a strong signal that financial regulation in the Trump administration will emphasize helping companies raise capital in the public markets over tightening regulation . 
In contrast the agency 's two chairwomen under President Obama had regulatory or enforcement backgrounds . 
Mr. Clayton known as Jay has spent nearly his entire career in corporate boardrooms . 
His regulatory experience stems from advising banks on dealings with the government and helping several financial institutions with their settlements related to mortgage securities . 
He had a seat to the financial crisis advising Barclays Capital in buying the assets of the bankrupt Lehman Brothers in 2008 and Bear Stearns in its fire sale to JPMorgan Chase in 2007 . 
He has advised on mergers and initial public offerings including the biggest ever the $ 25 billion offering by Alibaba Group of China in 2013 . 
If Mr. Clayton is confirmed he may have to recuse himself from some matters . 
A similar scrutiny was applied to Mary Jo White the agency 's current chairwoman . 
She had been a litigator at Debevoise Plimpton where her clients included JPMorgan Chase Rupert Murdoch 's News Corporation and Kenneth D. Lewis a former Bank of America chief executive . 
Still such recusals are not unusual . 
Laura S. Unger a former commissioner and acting chairwoman said that during her tenure she had to recuse herself from a number of matters before the commission . 
She said the process of deciding when to recuse oneself often took place in consultation with the commission 's ethics officer . 
An ethics officer at the S. E. C. knows all of your intimate details and the ethics officer flags for you what may be potential conflicts '' she noted . 
Yet Mr. Clayton 's nomination will be sure to fuel criticism that Goldman Sachs could wield too much influence in the Trump administration . 
Sullivan Cromwell where Mr. Clayton is a partner 1.0 CHARLESTON S. C. — Seeming to abdicate one of his last chances to save his own life the convicted killer Dylann S. Roof stood on Wednesday before the jurors who will decide his fate and offered no apology no explanation and no remorse for massacring nine black churchgoers during a Bible study session in June 2015 . 
Instead in a strikingly brief opening statement in the sentencing phase of his federal death penalty trial Mr. Roof repeatedly assured the jury that he was not mentally ill — undercutting one of the few mitigating factors that could work in his favor — and left it at that . 
Other than the fact that I trust people that I should n't and the fact that I 'm probably better at constantly embarrassing myself than anyone who 's ever existed there 's nothing wrong with me psychologically '' Mr. Roof who is representing himself told the jury which found him guilty last month of the killings at Charleston 's Emanuel African Methodist Episcopal Church . 
Three minutes after walking to the lectern Mr. Roof returned to the defense table exhaling deeply . 
Any prospects for mercy by the jury had perhaps already been drained by the prosecution 's disclosure in its opening statement of a white supremacist manifesto written by Mr. Roof in the Charleston County jail sometime in the six weeks after his arrest . 
I would like to make it crystal clear I do not regret what I did '' he wrote in his distinctive scrawl . 
I am not sorry . 
I have not shed a tear for the innocent people I killed . '' 
Mr. Roof who was then 21 continued : I do feel sorry for the innocent white children forced to live in this sick country and I do feel sorry for the innocent white people that are killed daily at the hands of the lower race . 
I have shed a tear of for myself . 
I feel pity that I had to do what I did in the first place . 
I feel pity that I had to give up my life because of a situation that should never have existed . '' 
As the government laid out its case for a death sentence the prosecutor who read from the journal ISTANBUL — Turkish officials accused the United States of abetting a failed coup last summer . 
When the Russian ambassador to Turkey was assassinated last month the Turkish press said the United States was behind the attack . 
And once again after a gunman walked into an Istanbul nightclub early on New Year 's Day and killed dozens the news media pointed a finger at the United States . 
America Chief Suspect '' one headline blared after the attack . 
On Twitter a Turkish lawmaker referring to the name of the nightclub wrote : Whoever the triggerman is Reina attack is an act of CIA . 
Period . '' 
Turkey has been confronted with a cascade of crises that seem to have only accelerated as the Syrian civil war has spilled across the border . 
But the events have not pushed Turkey closer to its NATO allies . 
Conversely they have drifted further apart as the nation lashes out at Washington and moves closer to Moscow working with the Russian president Vladimir V. Putin to secure a in Syria . 
One story in the Turkish press based on a routine travel warning issued by the American Embassy in Turkey was that the United States had advance knowledge of the nightclub attack which the Islamic State later claimed responsibility for . 
Another suggested that stun grenades used by the gunman had come from stocks held by the American military . 
Still another claimed the assault was a plot by the United States to sow divisions in Turkey between the secular and the religious . 
Rather than bringing the United States and Turkey together in the common fight against terrorism the nightclub attack even with the gunman still on the run appears to have only accelerated Turkey 's shift away from the West at a time when its democracy is eroding amid a growing crackdown on civil society . 
All of this is a reflection BEIRUT Lebanon — For millions of Damascus residents concerns about the direction of the war in Syria have been replaced by worries about where to get enough water to do the dishes wash clothes or take a shower . 
For nearly two weeks the Syrian capital and its vicinity have been afflicted by a water crisis that has left taps dry caused long lines at wells and forced people to stretch whatever thin resources they can find . 
When the world gets hard for us we work something out '' said a woman in a video posted on Facebook showing how she used a cola bottle to wash teacups . 
When you cut off the water we dig for water . 
When you cut off the tap we make a tap . '' 
Like most of Syria 's problems the Damascus water crisis is a symptom of the war which has killed hundreds of thousands of people displaced about half the country 's prewar population of 22 million and left its territory divided into zones controlled by the government armed rebels and jihadist groups . 
While a brokered by Russia and Turkey and announced last week has reduced overall violence across the country it has not stopped the fighting everywhere nor has it resolved what happens when resources needed by one side are controlled by its enemies as appears to be the case with Damascus 's water . 
Historically most of the water for the capital which is controlled by the government of President Bashar has come from the Barada Valley north of the city which is controlled by rebels who want to oust Mr. Assad . 
The crisis began on Dec. 22 when the water stopped flowing . 
Each side has accused the other of damaging infrastructure near the spring Canada our No. 1 pick for this year 's 52 Places to Go list spans millions of square miles . 
It also contains multitudes not just of people and locations but of memories . 
We asked five Canadian authors to reflect on places that have lodged in their psyches . 
My mother always kept a bright yellow hard hat in her car an unexpected accessory for a petite Hong Kong immigrant in her . 
She was the senior purchaser for a British Columbia forestry company that in lean years laid off everyone in her department except her . 
( More 's the pity she dreamed of early retirement . ) 
In the meantime she shuttled between the province 's pulp and paper mills doing the job of six people negotiating contracts for hotels log loaders harvesters and more . 
One year when I was 25 I finally said yes to her persistent invitations to tag along . 
She wanted me to meet the men and women who earned their living in the mill towns and who called her by her English name Matilda .

You will likely have some questions : How did the No. 1 spot get there ? 
Why is my favorite spot not on the list ? 
What 's the deal with those 360 videos online at nytimes . 
? 
Here are some frequently asked questions about how we chose our 52 Places to Go in 2017 . 
What made Canada the top choice ? 
And why would you choose a country ? 
Canada has it all ( O. K. maybe not tropical beaches ) . 
It 's a world unto itself with Vancouver Island surf breaks culinary delights in Toronto and Montreal and natural glories of parks like Banff in Alberta . 
And let 's face it clichés of Mounties and hockey aside Canada remains a terra incognita for Americans and much of the world . 
It 's a great time to correct that as the country celebrates its 150th anniversary this year ( which means free admission all year to those national parks ) and currently offers a generous exchange rate with the United States dollar . 
What is special about the list online ? 
And in print ? 
Look at the interactive version of the list on a computer or mobile device and you 'll notice a bunch of 360 videos that allow you to explore some of these places in a newly immersive way . 
Travel is a great match for 360 videos because the medium provides a vivid sense of place '' said Maureen Towey the senior producer for 360 News at The New York Times . 
We ask our shooters to be adventurous in their camera placement . 
When they ask if they can rig the camera to a motorcycle a balloon or a ski lift we say yes every time . '' 
On a computer you 'll also notice a stunning drone video shot in Tofino on the western coast of Vancouver Island . 
After many wet days there was one morning the clouds broke and the waves were a bit better '' said Josh Haner a staff photographer who shot the footage . 
As my drone 's batteries were running out I looked to the right and a beautiful rainbow filled the beach . 
It was a spectacular 45 minutes . '' 
And print readers will notice something new as well : a special presentation of the list that can be removed from the section and pored over ( or hung on the wall ) .

You 've got a few more days to catch Stephen Karam 's gorgeous The Humans '' last season 's Tony winner for best play ( ending on Jan. 15 ) and even fewer to jump on the exhilarating emotional roller coaster that is the sublime revival of the musical Falsettos '' ( ending on Sunday ) . 
Looking further ahead here are other notable shows and events I 'd put at the top of my list . 
The first of the majestic cycle of plays written by the great August Wilson this drama set in the 1970s ( and written in 1979 ) was until now the only piece of the cycle not to be produced on Broadway . 
A classic Wilson ensemble drama about a group of gypsy cab drivers in the Hill District of Pittsburgh the new Manhattan Theater Club production is directed by Ruben who has both appeared in and directed Wilson 's plays — notably the superb recent revival of The Piano Lesson '' from the Signature Theater .

Normally I frown on theater as a rarefied form of stargazing . 
But with a star as luminous as Cate Blanchett I will grant an exception . 
And of course Ms. Blanchett who graces this new adaptation of Platonov '' an early Chekhov play is not merely a movie star burnishing her reputation with a Broadway debut . 
During the past decade she has made regular acclaimed appearances on the New York stage in productions imported from the Sydney Theater Company ( as is this one ) . 
An unwieldy drama about the familiar Chekhovian concerns — lives full of regret stomachs bloated with vodka — the play has been moved from Russia in the 19th century to Russia in the late 20th century for this version by Andrew Upton Ms. Blanchett 's husband . 
The esteemed Australian actor Richard Roxburgh is Platonov . 
( In previews for a Sunday opening at the Barrymore Theater . ) 
I have been saving this lovable classic as a cure for the blues . 
The small but enterprising Irish Rep first produced this delicious musical whimsy with a glorious Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo of New York said on Wednesday that with a complete overhaul of La Guardia Airport underway he wants to rebuild New York City 's other airport John F. Kennedy International . 
Mr. Cuomo outlined a plan to spend more than $ 10 billion modernizing Kennedy 's terminals and improving the highway and transit systems connected to the airport . 
He did not provide a timetable for the plan or say specifically where all of the money would come from . 
The next step is to tackle J. F. K. because La Guardia is n't enough '' Mr. Cuomo said speaking at a meeting of the Association for a Better New York a business group in Manhattan . 
We need to build a new airport at J. F. K. and go through the same process as we did with La Guardia . '' 
In promoting big infrastructure projects including the Second Avenue subway which opened Sunday Mr. Cuomo is building his legacy in New York and perhaps raising his national profile . 
The plans offered by Mr. Cuomo on Wednesday suggest that he does not intend to stop trying to impose his will on the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey which operates La Guardia and J. F. K . 
The authority 's commissioners are scheduled to meet on Thursday to vote on a $ 30 billion spending plan that includes only about $ 1 billion for improvements at J. F. K . 
When Mr. Cuomo formed an advisory group in 2015 to study how to improve J. F. K. he said the panel would make recommendations to the authority . 
But the authority 's chairman John J. Degnan did not see the panel 's final report until Tuesday . 
We await an opportunity to review the details of the governor 's proposal '' Mr. Degnan said on Wednesday . 
We will have to evaluate it against other compelling capital needs identified by the Port Authority both within other airports and within other operations that we oversee . '' 
Mr. Degnan an appointee of Gov. Chris Christie of New Jersey a Republican has been at odds with Mr. Cuomo a Democrat over the authority 's spending priorities . 
The agency also operates the main commuter bus terminal in Manhattan and Newark Liberty International Airport . 
Mr. Cuomo pushed for $ 2 . 
5 billion in the capital plan for improvements at the New York airports On the morning of May 18 2014 Violeta Lagunes was perplexed by a series of strange messages that appeared in her Gmail inbox . 
It was Election Day to choose the leadership of Mexico 's Partido Acción Nacional or PAN and Lagunes a former federal congresswoman was holding a strategy meeting in her office in Puebla city . 
The emails seemed harmless at least at first . 
One appeared to come from the account of a trusted colleague . 
It asked her to download and review a document . 
Lagunes clicked on the link but it seemed to be broken so she wrote back to her colleague and asked him to send it again . 
Elsewhere in her inbox was an email from Google warning her that someone had tried to log in to her account . 
Meanwhile she began to receive phone calls from PAN allies who claimed that they had received emails from Lagunes 's account that she did not remember sending . 
Now Lagunes was worried . 
Around 1 o'clock she called the colleague who appeared to have emailed her . 
She reached him at a restaurant where he was finishing lunch with other campaign allies . 
I did not send you an email '' he insisted . 
A consultant with the campaign — who asked to remain anonymous in order to preserve his relationships with other candidates — overheard the conversation . 
He knew of other campaign workers who had been receiving similar messages : emails with vague subject lines asking the recipient to review a document or click a link . 
The campaign he realized had been hacked . 
In the vote for party leader Lagunes and her allies in Puebla — a drive southeast from Mexico City — were supporting the challenger a senator who promised to return the party to its conservative roots . 
But the incumbent was backed by Puebla 's powerful governor Rafael Moreno Valle . 
One of Mexico 's rising political stars It has n't been a great time to be a man without a job . 
The jobs that have been disappearing like machine operator are predominantly those that men do . 
The occupations that are growing like health aide employ mostly women . 
One solution is for the men who have lost jobs in factories to become health aides . 
But while more than a fifth of American men are n't working they are n't running to these new jobs . 
Why ? 
They require very different skills and pay a lot less . 
They 're also seen as women 's work which has always been devalued in the American labor market . 
The two occupations predicted by the Bureau of Labor Statistics to decline most quickly from 2014 to 2024 are locomotive firers shrinking 70 percent and vehicle electronics installers and repairers down 50 percent . 
They are 96 percent and 98 percent male . 
Of the jobs many are various types of health aides which are about 90 percent female . 
They stayed in bunk beds , practiced dancing and singing together during the final stages of the program . ''
